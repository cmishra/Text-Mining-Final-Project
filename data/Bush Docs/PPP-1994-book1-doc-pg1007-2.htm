Statement on the Death of Ezra Taft Benson
May 31, 1994

    It was with sadness that I learned today of the passing of Ezra Taft 
Benson, who served our country and his church with ceaseless dedication 
over a long life productively lived.
    It is no accident that one of Mr. Benson's most famous books 
emphasized in its words and thoughts the three values his life best 
represented--church, God, and country. He was a leader of his church for 
five decades, he preached with passion for unity, solidarity, and 
responsibility within the family, and he served ably in the Eisenhower 
administration as Agriculture Secretary.
    As we celebrate D-Day and the liberation of Europe, it is important 
to remember that Mr. Benson was the first representative of his church 
to reenter post-war Europe, where he distributed aid and lifted the 
spirits of thousands of survivors.

    His friends and fellow believers remind us tonight that Ezra Taft 
Benson was a lifelong scouter, a strong defender of the Constitution, 
the creator of the soil bank, a religious man who expanded the 
membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and 
someone who believed and preached the idea that families come first.
    We rejoice in his service, we remember his life, and we extend our 
heartfelt sympathies to his family, his church, and his admirers 
worldwide.
