Statement on Congressional Action on Farm Security and Rural Development 
Legislation
May 2, 2002

    I congratulate Chairman Combest<Combest, Larry> and the 
other House and Senate conferees for a job well done in completing the 
``Farm Security and Rural Development Act of 2002.''

[[Page 710]]

    I am pleased that the compromise agreement on the farm bill resulted 
in better balanced commodity loan rates; spending that is no longer 
front-loaded; and the strongest conservation provisions of any farm bill 
ever passed by Congress. The final provisions of the farm bill are also 
consistent with America's international trade obligations, which will 
strengthen our ability to open foreign markets for American farm 
products. While this compromise agreement did not satisfy all of my 
objectives, I am pleased that this farm bill provides a generous and 
reliable safety net for our Nation's farmers and ranchers and is 
consistent with the principles I outlined.
    I thank the conferees for their hard work and urge Congress to send 
the farm bill to my desk promptly for signature to help ensure the 
immediate and long-term vitality of our farm economy.
