Remarks After Signing the Book of Condolences at the Embassy of Pakistan
October 14, 2005

    Mr. Ambassador,<Karamat, Jehangin<ls-thn-eq> thank you for having 
us. I'm here to express the condolences of the American people to those 
who suffered mightily as a result of the earthquake that struck your 
country. There's been a lot of loss of life, and Americans pray for 
those families who have lost a loved one.
    There's been a lot of damage, and we want to help in any way we can. 
I told the Ambassador that--reminded him what I told 
President<Musharraf, Pervez<ls-thn-eq> Musharraf--I said when I spoke to 
him, I said, ``Pakistan is a friend, and America will help.'' We've 
moved a lot of military equipment in there. We're helping with 
humanitarian aid as well. And so not only will we offer our prayers, but 
we'll offer our help and help the people and help the Government, help 
this great nation get back on its feet.
    Thank you for having us.

Note: The President spoke at 10:46 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S. Jehangir Karamat; and President Pervez 
Musharraf of Pakistan.
