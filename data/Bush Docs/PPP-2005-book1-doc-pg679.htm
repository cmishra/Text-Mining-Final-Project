Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Child Interstate 
Abortion Notification Legislation
April 27, 2005

    I commend the House for its bipartisan vote to protect the health 
and safety of minors by ensuring that State parental involvement laws 
are not circumvented. The parents of pregnant minors can provide 
counsel, guidance, and support to their children and should be involved 
in these decisions. I urge the Senate to pass this important legislation 
and help continue to build a culture of life in America.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 748.
