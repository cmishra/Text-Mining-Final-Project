Statement on the Report of the Commission on the Future of Higher 
Education
September 26, 2006

    Today Education Secretary Margaret Spellings<Spellings, 
Margaret<ls-thn-eq> released the report of a commission whose focus was 
to help make America's higher education system more affordable and more 
accessible and to provide parents and students with information that 
will help them make better-informed choices. I strongly support the 
thrust of this important report and look forward to working with 
Secretary Spellings, the higher education community, the Congress, and 
the States to ensure that our higher education system remains the finest 
in the world.
    America's colleges and universities have always played an important 
role in advancing innovation, opportunity, and prosperity throughout our 
Nation and the world. We must all work to provide our students with the 
knowledge and skills they need to shape a hopeful future for our 
country.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
transcript of this statement.
