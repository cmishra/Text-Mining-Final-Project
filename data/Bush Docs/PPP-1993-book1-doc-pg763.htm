Remarks on House of Representatives Action on the Budget
May 27, 1993

    For a long time now, the American people have wondered whether their 
Government in Washington could ever really work for them again, ever 
really face the tough problems. Well, tonight the House of 
Representatives gave America a victory of growth over gridlock. Tonight 
the House showed courage and conviction. Tonight the House made hard 
choices: to cut a quarter of a billion dollars in spending; to ask those 
most able to pay, the wealthy, to do more to reduce our deficit; to 
increase incentives to invest and create jobs in the private sector; and 
to provide the incentives to make people at the bottom rungs of the 
economy prefer work over welfare. Tonight the House said no to gridlock, 
no to the status quo, and no to the special interests who worked so very 
hard to frighten millions of Americans about this program. Tonight the 
House said yes to jobs, yes to lowering the deficit, yes to lower 
interest rates, yes to a brighter future.
    Tomorrow we go on to the Senate, and we go back to the country. We 
have broken the gridlock. We are taking responsibility for the future. 
We are dealing with the tough problems. I am very, very proud of the 
people who tonight cast a very tough vote in a hard environment for a 
better tomorrow for America.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 9:40 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House.
