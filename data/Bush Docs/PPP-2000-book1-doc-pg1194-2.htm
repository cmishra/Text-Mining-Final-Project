Statement on European Security and Defense Policy
June 20, 2000

    I welcome the progress the European Union made at the Feira Summit 
to develop a common European security and defense policy. It will 
strengthen Europe's ability--and responsibility--to act in times of 
crisis. It will improve cooperation between the European Union and NATO. 
It will advance European unity while maintaining the vitality of the 
transatlantic alliance. I look forward to early implementation of the 
agreed steps, including the establishment of NATO-EU working groups and 
regular meetings with non-EU allies.
    I also welcome the EU's commitment to create a standing roster of 
police officers who can be deployed to support peacekeeping missions. As 
we have seen in Bosnia and Kosovo, there is a critical need for 
international civilian police who can fill the gap between local police 
and military peacekeepers in countries emerging from conflict. We will 
continue to work with

Europe to ensure such forces can deploy rapidly when they are needed.
