Statement on the Death of Representative Walter H. Capps
October 28, 1997

    Hillary and I were shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the death 
of Representative Walter Capps. He was a rare soul, someone able to fuse 
intense spirituality with a devotion to his community and country. He 
brought constant values, a rare perspective, and a sense of moral 
grounding that public life too often lacks, and will sorely miss. I will 
always be grateful for his friendship and support. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his wife, Lois, his children Lisa, Todd, and Laura, who 
has worked with us at the White House, and their entire family.
