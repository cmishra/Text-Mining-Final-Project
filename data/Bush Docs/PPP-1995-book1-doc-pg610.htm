Message on Public Service Recognition Week, 1995
April 28, 1995

    Greetings to everyone celebrating Public Service Recognition Week, 
1995.
    Our nation's government has tremendous potential for good when it 
works in partnership with citizens to expand opportunity. With the 
assistance of dedicated public employees, our government has helped to 
advance civil rights, defend freedom, protect our environment, and 
uplift the lives of countless Americans. All those who serve the people 
of the United States can be proud of their contributions to this 
important legacy.
    As our Administration continues its efforts to make government work 
better and cost less, this week offers Americans a special opportunity 
to learn more about the importance of public service. Every citizen has 
a solemn responsibility to understand and become involved in ensuring 
our country's success. I encourage all of you to discover the many ways 
in which our government is changing to keep pace with the times. Your 
participation can help to ensure a brighter future for you and your 
family and for communities throughout the land.
    Best wishes for a most successful week.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: Public Service Recognition Week was observed May 1-7.
