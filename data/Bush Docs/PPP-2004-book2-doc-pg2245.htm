Remarks Following an Inspection of Hurricane Damage in Lake Wales, 
Florida
September 29, 2004

    I want to thank the McKenna<McKenna, Pat<ls-thn-eq> boys<McKenna, 
Marty<ls-thn-eq> for showing us around here, giving us a chance to see 
the devastation that took place here from not just one hurricane but 
three hurricanes. I want to thank my brother Jeb<Bush, Jeb<ls-thn-eq> 
for his hospitality and his leadership. I want to thank Secretary of 
Agriculture Ann Veneman,<Veneman, Ann M.<ls-thn-eq> for being down here. 
I want to thank Charlie Bronson,<Bronson, Charles H.<ls-thn-eq> 
secretary of agriculture. I want to thank Adam Putnam,<Putnam, Adam 
H.<ls-thn-eq> Congressman from this part of the world. Every time I see 
Adam, all he does is talk about oranges. His hair is kind of orange.
    I understand a lot of people in this area, like Marty<McKenna, 
Marty<ls-thn-eq> and Pat,<McKenna, Pat<ls-thn-eq> were hit hard by 
Jeanne and Charley and Frances. These are storms that have taken lives, 
storms that have created severe flooding, storms that caused major power 
outages, and storms that damaged farms and homes and hospitals and 
roads. It's been a devastating period for the State of Florida. It is 
the first time in nearly 120 years that four hurricanes have hit the 
same State in a single season. People of Florida have met historic 
challenges with extraordinary strength and generosity.
    State emergency response teams have saved lives by evacuating people 
before the storm and responding swiftly after the storm arrived. Power 
crews and telephone workers are putting in long hours to restore 
services. Despite week after week of strain, faith-based groups like 
Southern Baptists and the Salvation Army are setting up kitchens to feed 
the hungry. The Red Cross is running shelters and providing medical 
services for the injured. The National Guard is distributing supplies 
and conducting safety patrols. Across the State, people are showing 
great compassion and helping their neighbors make it through these 
storms, and I thank them for their care and their decency.
    The Federal Government is continuing our active role in the recovery 
efforts. We're working closely with Governors like Jeb<Bush, 
Jeb<ls-thn-eq> and with other State and local officials to make sure 
resources reach the people who need it. I've asked Congress to provide 
$12.2 billion to respond to Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and 
Jeanne. My request provides resources to repair bridges and highways and 
hospitals. It includes funding for the Small Business Administration to 
make loans to homeowners and small businesses. It includes more than $8 
billion for FEMA, the largest amount ever provided in response to a 
natural disaster. FEMA has responded rapidly to all four storms, and 
they continue working to make disaster assistance available to people in 
need.
    I want to thank Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge<Ridge, 
Tom<ls-thn-eq> and FEMA Director Mike Brown<Brown, Mike<ls-thn-eq> for 
their tremendous work these past few weeks. They, and those who work for 
FEMA, have the gratitude of the administration and the people of this 
country.

    I know Florida's agriculture sector has been hit especially hard. 
Marty<McKenna, Marty<ls-thn-eq> and Pat<McKenna, Pat<ls-thn-eq> almost 
lost half their orange crop. I know a lot of other growers have lost a 
lot of crop too. My budget request will provide vital assistance to the 
citrus growers and to other farmers and ranchers who've suffered losses. 
Secretary Veneman<Veneman, Ann M.<ls-thn-eq> and I will also ensure that 
Florida farmers are treated fairly on the global market and that no 
country takes advantage of citrus growers during this time of disaster. 
My administration will make sure that citrus remains a strong part of 
this State's economy.
    The Federal Government is committed to helping people here get back 
on their feet. I call on Congress to pass my supplemental request 
quickly so we can get more people in Florida the help they need. These 
have been trying weeks for Americans across the Southeast, especially in 
this State. Once again, I want to thank Jeb<Bush, Jeb<ls-thn-eq> for his 
outstanding leadership. I thank the citizens of Florida for their great 
courage and their decency. Our Nation is praying for the victims of 
these storms. We pray for all who come to their aid.
    May God bless you all. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 3:39 p.m. in an orange grove owned by 
brothers Marty and Pat McKenna. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. Jeb 
Bush of Florida; Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Charles H. Bronson; 
and Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness and 
Response Mike Brown. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a 
Spanish language transcript of these remarks. A tape was not available 
for verification of the content of these remarks.
