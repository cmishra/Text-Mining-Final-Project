Message to the Senate Transmitting the Belize-United States Extradition 
Treaty
July 27, 2000

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Belize, 
signed at Belize on March 30, 2000.
    In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
    The Treaty is one of a series of modern extradition treaties being 
negotiated by the United States in order to counter criminal activities 
more effectively. Upon entry into force, the Treaty will replace the 
outdated Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United Kingdom 
of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the United 
States of America, signed at London, June 8, 1972, entered into force on 
October 21, 1976, and made applicable to Belize on January 21, 1977. 
That Treaty continued in force for Belize following independence. This 
Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between the law 
enforcement communities of the two countries. It will thereby make a 
significant contribution to

international law enforcement efforts against serious offenses, 
including terrorism, organized crime, and drug-trafficking offenses.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 27, 2000.
