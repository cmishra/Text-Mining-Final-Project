Statement on the Millennium Challenge Account
September 16, 2004

    The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is a groundbreaking 
initiative that encourages all nations to embrace political and economic 
reform and has enjoyed bipartisan support since I announced it 2 years 
ago. The powerful combination of trade, open markets, and good 
government is history's proven method to defeat poverty on a large 
scale, to vastly improve health and education, to build a modern 
infrastructure while safeguarding the environment, and to spread liberty 
and enterprise.
    Already, the MCA has encouraged countries to govern justly, invest 
in their people, and promote economic freedom. The MCA will support 
these efforts, helping the poorest countries seize the opportunities of 
the global economy and meet the needs of their people for better health 
and education, cleaner water, and a brighter future. I urge Congress to 
ensure that the MCA can fulfill its promise as a bold new vision for 
international development and a powerful expression of the generous 
spirit of the American people.
