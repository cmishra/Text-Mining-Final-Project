Message to the Senate Transmitting the International Fishing 
Conservation and Management Agreement
April 25, 1994

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
acceptance, I transmit herewith the Agreement to Promote Compliance With 
International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on 
the High Seas, which was adopted at Rome by consensus by the Conference 
of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (``FAO'') on 
November 24, 1993.
    This Agreement was negotiated largely on the initiative of the 
United States, in response to the fisheries crises that have arisen in 
many corners of the world. In my view, it represents a significant 
breakthrough and offers the international community an opportunity to 
develop responsible fishing practices on a global basis. The Agreement 
once implemented, will begin to resolve many of the problems that have 
undermined the sustainability of high seas fishing resources. By 
becoming party to this Agreement, the United States would continue to 
demonstrate its commitment to preserving these resources and the 
livelihoods that depend on them.
    The Agreement sets forth a broad range of obligations for Parties 
whose fishing vessels operate on the high seas, including the obligation 
to ensure that such vessels do not undermine international fishery 
conservation and management measures. Parties must also prohibit their 
vessels from fishing on the high seas without specific authorization and 
must take enforcement measures in respect of vessels that contravene 
requirements flowing from the Agreement.
    The Agreement also creates an important role for the FAO as a 
clearinghouse of data relating to high seas fishing. Through the 
collection and dissemination of such data, it will be possible to 
improve our knowledge of all high seas fisheries, which is of critical 
importance if the international community is to protect these valuable 
resources successfully.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Agreement and give its advice and consent to acceptance.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

April 25, 1994.
