Remarks Following the Entertainment at the State Dinner Honoring 
Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada
April 8, 1997

    Let me say to all of you, first, I have wanted Denyce to sing here 
for a very long time, and I have patiently waited for the chance to get 
all this worked out. And I heard her sing not very long ago at the 
annual prayer breakfast here in Washington. And I came home, and I said, 
``I'm impatient. I'm tired of this. I want this woman at the Canadian 
state dinner.'' [Laughter] I don't know whether she had to cancel 
something else to be here tonight or not.
    Thank you, Warren, for your wonderful playing and your artistry. I 
thought they were a fitting end to a wonderful evening.
    Now, let me again say to Jean and Aline and to all the Canadians who 
are here, we're delighted to have you. There will be music and dancing 
in the hall for those of you who are capable. [Laughter] And the rest of 
us will creep off into the sunset. [Laughter] But you may stay as long 
as you like.
    And again, please join me in expressing our appreciation to Warren 
Jones and Denyce Graves. [Applause]
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 10:34 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Chretien's wife, 
Aline.
