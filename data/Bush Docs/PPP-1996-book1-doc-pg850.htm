Statement on the Tornado in Kentucky
June 1, 1996

    Last Tuesday many of you felt the real-life trauma caused by a 
powerful tornado. Many of your homes were damaged or destroyed. We have 
already begun to help you as you recover from this terrible storm. I 
have declared that a major disaster exists in portions of Kentucky, and 
I have directed the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA), James Lee Witt, to make sure that Federal assistance is 
available immediately. FEMA will work with State and local efforts to 
make sure that help continues with speed and efficiency.
    The good people of Kentucky have already begun to help their 
neighbors recover from this tornado, and I want to assure you that we 
will do everything we can to continue to do our part to help rebuild the 
affected communities.
    Our hearts and prayers are with you.
