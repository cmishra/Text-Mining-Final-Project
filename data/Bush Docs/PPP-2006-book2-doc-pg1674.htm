Statement on Senate Passage of the United States-Oman Free Trade 
Agreement
September 19, 2006

    I commend the Senate for passing the U.S.-Oman free trade agreement, 
which will deliver benefits to both America and Oman. This agreement 
will level the playing field for U.S. workers and businesses, provide 
additional market access for U.S. goods, help Oman's leaders develop 
long-term opportunities for their people, and advance our shared goal of 
building a Middle East free trade area.
    By strengthening our relations with a strategic friend and ally in 
the Middle East, this important agreement will also help protect 
America's national security interests.
    I look forward to signing this legislation into law.
