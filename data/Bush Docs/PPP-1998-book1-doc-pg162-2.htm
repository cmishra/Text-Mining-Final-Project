Message to the Congress Transmitting the Latvia-United States Fisheries 
Agreement
February 3, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an 
Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Republic of Latvia extending the Agreement of April 8, 
1993, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, with 
annex, as extended (the 1993 Agreement). The present Agreement, which 
was effected by an exchange of notes at Riga on February 13 and May 23, 
1997, extends the 1993 Agreement to December 31, 1999.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Latvia, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 3, 1998.
