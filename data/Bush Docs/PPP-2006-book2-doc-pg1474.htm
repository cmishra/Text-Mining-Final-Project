Remarks on the Situation in the Middle East
July 30, 2006

    The current situation in the Middle East is a reminder that all of 
us must work together to achieve a sustainable peace. America mourns the 
loss of innocent life. It's a tragic occasion when innocent people are 
killed. And so our sympathies go out to those who've lost their lives 
today and lost their lives throughout this crisis.
    I've been in touch with Secretary of State Rice<Rice, 
Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> twice today. She'll be returning tomorrow, where 
she'll brief me on her discussions with leaders in the Middle East. I 
also talked to Tony Blair.<Blair, Tony<ls-thn-eq> The United States is 
resolved to work with members of the United Nations Security Council to 
develop a resolution that will enable the region to have a sustainable 
peace, a peace that lasts, a peace that will enable mothers and fathers 
to raise their children in a hopeful world.
    May God bless those who lost their lives. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 4:12 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Tony Blair of the 
United Kingdom.
