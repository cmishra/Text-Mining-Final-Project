Message on the Observance of Passover, 5768
April 18, 2008

    Then Moses said to the people, ``Commemorate this day, the day you 
came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the Lord brought 
you out of it with a mighty hand.''

                                                             Exodus 13:3

    I send greetings to those observing Passover.
    More than 3,000 years ago, God liberated the Children of Israel from 
the bondage of Egypt and led them on a journey towards the Promised 
Land. During the holy days of Passover, Jews around the world celebrate 
this deliverance from oppression and give thanks to a loving God for His 
many blessings. Passover is an opportunity for Jewish families and 
friends to gather to read the Haggadah, share the Seder meal, and 
remember God's mercy through song and prayer. This eight-day observance 
brings a message of hope and freedom to the Jewish people.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a joyous 
Passover.

                                                          George W. Bush
