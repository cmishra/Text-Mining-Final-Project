Statement on the Northern Ireland Agreement
December 1, 2006

    The United States welcomes the recent progress made by the Northern 
Ireland parties and the British and Irish Governments to implement the 
agreement reached at St. Andrews, and I recognize the leadership shown 
by the political party leaders. The United States fully supports the 
agreed way forward for Northern Ireland: a power-sharing government by 
the end of March next year, based on support for the rule of law and 
policing.
