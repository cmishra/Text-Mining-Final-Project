Statement on the Indonesia-Free Aceh Movement Decision To Resume 
Discussions on Implementation of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement
May 15, 2003

    The United States welcomes the decision of the Government of 
Indonesia and the leadership of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) to resume 
discussions in Tokyo this weekend aimed at implementing the December 
2002 Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COHA) between Indonesia and the 
GAM. The United States strongly supports efforts to pursue a negotiated 
peace in Aceh within the framework of a unified Indonesia.
    I commend President Megawati<Megawati Sukarnoputri for 
demonstrating her Government's commitment to the Aceh peace process and 
for her willingness to go the extra mile in pursuit of peace. In 
returning to the negotiating table, the two sides are taking a concrete 
step toward a better future for the people of Aceh. I call on the 
leadership of the GAM to renew its commitment to a peaceful solution in 
Aceh and for both sides to pursue good faith implementation of the COHA. 
The United States appreciates the determined efforts of the Henri Dunant 
Center to advance the cause of peace and justice for Aceh. I also wish 
to thank Prime Minister Koizumi<Koizumi, Junichiro> and the 
Government of Japan for hosting the negotiations between Indonesia and 
the GAM and taking an active leadership role in this process.
