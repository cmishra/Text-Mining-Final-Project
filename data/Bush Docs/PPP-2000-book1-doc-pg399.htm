Statement on Senate Action on Judicial Nominations
March 7, 2000

    I am pleased that the United States Senate, by a vote of 93 to 0, 
has confirmed Julio Fuentes<Fuentes, Julio<ls-thn-eq> to be a judge on 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Judge Fuentes, whom I 
nominated one year ago tomorrow, is a richly experienced State court 
judge from Newark, New Jersey. He will be the first Hispanic judge to 
serve on the Third Circuit.
    Despite this positive step, however, the Senate still must act on 
the 38 judicial nominees currently awaiting hearings or floor votes. In 
particular, the Senate is poised to act this week on the nominations of 
Richard Paez<Paez, Richard A.<ls-thn-eq> and Marsha Berzon<Berzon, 
Marsha<ls-thn-eq> to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
Paez, the first Mexican-American ever to serve as a Federal district 
court judge in Los Angeles, has awaited a vote for more than 4 years, 
longer than any judicial nominee in modern history. Berzon has been 
before the Senate for 2 years. Both are highly qualified individuals who 
will serve the courts and our country with distinction.
