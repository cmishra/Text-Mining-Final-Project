Statement on the Death of Howard Hunter
March 3, 1995

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Howard Hunter 
and we extend our deepest sympathy to his family. President Hunter 
provided great moral and spiritual leadership to all Mormons as well as 
the entire country. His message of the need for greater kindness, 
gentleness, tolerance, and forgiveness is an important one for all of 
us.
