Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
November 18, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period August 1 to September 30, 1998. The 
previous submission covered events during June and July 1998.
    United States efforts to bring about a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus issue based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation remained 
steadfast. United States officials encouraged the Greek Cypriot and 
Turkish Cypriot leadership to focus on the core issues of the Cyprus 
dispute and encouraged all parties to prepare for eventual comprehensive 
negotiations. My Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus, Richard C. 
Holbrooke, and the Special Cyprus Coordinator, Thomas J. Miller, 
underscored this message in a series of important meetings in September 
with Cypriot, Greek, and Turkish representatives attending the United 
Nations General Assembly.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
