Statement on Republican National Committee Leadership
January 19, 2007

    The Republican Party has a long and rich history of empowering 
Americans to determine the future of our country. Today members of the 
Republican National Committee selected a new team of leaders who will 
build upon our strong legacy and will encourage more Americans to join 
our party.
    We are fortunate that the Republican National Committee will be 
under the leadership of Senator Mel Martinez<Martinez, Melquiades R. 
``Mel''<ls-thn-eq> as general chairman, Mike Duncan<Duncan, Robert M. 
``Mike''<ls-thn-eq> as chairman, and Jo Ann Davidson<Davidson, Jo 
Ann<ls-thn-eq> as cochairman. Senator Martinez will help our party 
effectively communicate the Republican message of hope and opportunity 
for all Americans. Mike Duncan is a proven leader who will organize 
thousands of dedicated staff and volunteers to educate Americans about 
the great promise of our agenda. Jo Ann Davidson will continue to draw 
upon her extensive political experience to help expand our support in 
communities throughout our country.
    I am pleased that this team has been put into place and look forward 
to working with them on our continued efforts to keep our country safe 
and prosperous.
