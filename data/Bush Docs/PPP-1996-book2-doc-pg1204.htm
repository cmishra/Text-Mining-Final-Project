Statement on the Death of Hector Garcia
July 26, 1996

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of Dr. 
Hector P. Garcia. The founder of the American GI Forum, Dr. Garcia 
fought for half a century for the civil and educational rights of 
Mexican-Americans. A national hero and decorated Army veteran, Dr. 
Garcia became the first Hispanic-American to be awarded the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian honor.
    Recently, Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi, his hometown, 
dedicated the Hector P. Garcia Plaza and established the Hector P. 
Garcia Scholarship Endowment. It is a fitting tribute to a man who 
fought for the rights of Hispanic-Americans, veterans, and all Americans 
throughout his life. Hillary and I extend our deepest condolences to his 
family and to all the Latino community.
