Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Budget Amendment for the Department of the Interior
July 28, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendment to the FY 2009 
Budget for the Department of the Interior. Overall, the discretionary 
budget authority proposed in my FY 2009 Budget would not be affected by 
this amendment.
    The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
