Riga, Latvia

    Madam President,<Vike-Freiberga, Vaira<ls-thn-eq> I gratefully 
accept. I am so honored and so thrilled to be here in your beautiful 
country.
    I was telling the President that it's such a joy to come to a 
country that loves and values freedom and to be in the presence of a 
President who speaks so clearly about the need for people to be free and 
her recognition that a free world will yield peace.
    And so, Madam President,<Vike-Freiberga, Vaira<ls-thn-eq> thank you 
for your hospitality, and thank you so much for this great honor. 
Appreciate it.

Note: The President spoke at 9:55 a.m. in the Hall of Coats and Arms at 
Riga Castle. In his remarks, he referred to President Vaira Vike-
Freiberga of Latvia.
