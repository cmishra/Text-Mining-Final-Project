 Message to the Senate Transmitting the Peru-United States Extradition 
Treaty
 May 8, 2002

 To the Senate of the United States:
     With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the 
United States of America and the Republic of Peru, signed at Lima on 
July 26, 2001.
     In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
     The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of modern extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States 
and will replace the outdated extradition treaty in force between the 
two countries signed in 1899. The Treaty will, upon entry into force, 
enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of the two 
countries. It will make a significant contribution to international law 
enforcement efforts against serious offenses, including terrorism, 
organized crime, and drug-trafficking.
     I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 May 8, 2002.
