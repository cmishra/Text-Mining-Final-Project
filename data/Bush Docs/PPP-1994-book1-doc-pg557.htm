Statement on Tornado Destruction in the South
March 28, 1994

    I was deeply saddened to learn of the severe losses incurred by 
people and communities across the South as a result of the tornadoes 
which swept the region this weekend. Hillary and I want to express our 
sympathy and offer our prayers for all of those affected by the storm's 
devastating power, particularly those families who have lost someone to 
the destruction.
    I spoke to James Lee Witt, the Director of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, yesterday to get an update on the situation. I 
instructed him to report back to me after working with the affected 
States to assess the damage and evaluate appropriate actions.
