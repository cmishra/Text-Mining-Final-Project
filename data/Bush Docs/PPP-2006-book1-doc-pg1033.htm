Statement on Senate Confirmation of Robert J. Portman<Portman, Robert 
J.<ls-thn-eq> as Director of the Office of Management and Budget
May 26, 2006

    I commend the Senate for confirming Rob Portman as Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget. In this key position, Rob will have a 
leading role on my economic team and will help ensure that the 
Government spends the taxpayers' money wisely, or not at all. In 
addition, Rob will be in charge of implementing my goal of cutting the 
budget deficit in half by 2009 while funding our priorities. The 
American people deserve results for every hard-earned dollar they send 
to Washington. Rob is a man of character and will perform his duties 
with dedication and integrity. I congratulate Rob and his family on 
today's confirmation and thank him for his continued service to our 
Nation.
