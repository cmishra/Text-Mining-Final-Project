Letter to the Acting Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
on Disaster Assistance for Washington
March 4, 1993

Dear Mr. Tidball:
    I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of 
Washington, resulting from severe storms and high winds on January 20-
21, 1993, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major 
disaster declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore, declare 
that such a major disaster exists in the State of Washington.

    In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to 
allocate from funds available for these purposes, such amounts as you 
find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative 
expenses.
    You are authorized to provide Public Assistance in the designated 
areas. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be 
supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for 
Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible 
costs.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This letter was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary but was not issued as a White House press release.
