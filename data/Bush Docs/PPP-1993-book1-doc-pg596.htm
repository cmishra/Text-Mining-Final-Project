Nomination for the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority
May 7, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate two 
Tennesseans, Johnny Hayes and Craven Crowell, to serve as members of the 
Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Following his 
confirmation, Mr. Crowell will be designated by the President as 
Chairman of the Board.
    ``The Tennessee Valley Authority is one of the great success stories 
of the 20th century,'' said the President. ``It transformed the life of 
an entire region, and still has tremendous impact today. Through their 
years of service to their State and their Nation, Johnny Hayes and 
Craven Crowell have proven themselves capable of exercising stewardship 
over this important institution.''
