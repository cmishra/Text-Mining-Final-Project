Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Jammu and Kashmir, India
May 15, 2002

    The United States condemns the terrorist attack carried out by 
militants in Jammu and Kashmir yesterday. On behalf of the American 
people, I extend my condolences to the families of the victims and the 
people of Jammu and Kashmir, whose citizens were killed in this attack.

    Yesterday's attack was also aimed at destroying opportunities for 
South Asia to build a future that is more stable, more peaceful, and 
more prosperous. We will not allow terrorists to succeed in this larger 
mission. The United States will not yield in its determination to work 
with the people of South Asia to fight terrorism and to build a better 
future.
