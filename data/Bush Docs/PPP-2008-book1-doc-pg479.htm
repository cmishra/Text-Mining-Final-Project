Statement on the Death of Charlton Heston<Heston, Charlton<ls-thn-eq>
April 6, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by the death of our 
friend Charlton Heston. Charlton Heston was one of the most successful 
actors in movie history and a strong advocate for liberty.
    Widely acclaimed for his long, award-winning film career, he also 
had a profound impact off the screen. He served his country during World 
War II, marched in the civil rights movement, led a labor union, and 
vigorously defended Americans' second amendment rights. He was a man of 
character and integrity, with a big heart. For all these reasons, in 
2003, I was proud to award Charlton Heston the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom, the Nations's highest civil honor.
    Our prayers are with his wife Lydia<Heston, Lydia Clarke<ls-thn-eq> 
and the entire Heston family during this difficult time.
