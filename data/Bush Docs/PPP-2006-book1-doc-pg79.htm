Statement on the Death of Sheikh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah<Jabir 
al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah<ls-thn-eq> of Kuwait
January 17, 2006

    I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of His Highness Sheikh 
Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the Amir of Kuwait. Sheikh Jabir was a friend 
and steadfast and reliable ally of the United States. He supported the 
U.S. service men and women who fought to liberate Kuwait and later Iraq 
from the aggression and tyranny of Saddam Hussein.<Hussein, 
Saddam<ls-thn-eq> Sheikh Jabir worked tirelessly to provide a better 
future for Kuwait's citizens and was the driving force behind many 
reforms, including the establishment of a vibrant, elected Parliament 
and a free press. In his last months, he provided critical leadership to 
ensure that Kuwait's women achieved political rights. On behalf of the 
American people, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our deepest 
condolences to Sheikh Jabir's family and to the Government and people of 
Kuwait on the passing of this historic leader.
