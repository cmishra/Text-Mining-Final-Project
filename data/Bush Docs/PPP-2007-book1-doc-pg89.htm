Statement on the Death of Mary Tyler ``Molly'' Ivins<Ivins, 
Molly<ls-thn-eq>
January 31, 2007

    Molly Ivins was a Texas original. She was loved by her readers and 
by her many friends, particularly in central Texas. I respected her 
convictions, her passionate belief in the power of words, and her 
ability to turn a phrase. She fought her illness with that same passion. 
Her quick wit and commitment to her beliefs will be missed. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our condolences to Molly Ivins's family and 
friends.
