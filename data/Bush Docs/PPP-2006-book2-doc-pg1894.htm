Message on the Observance of Eid al-Fitr
October 20, 2006

    I send greetings to Muslims in the United States and around the 
world celebrating Eid al-Fitr.
    Islam is a great faith that has transcended racial and ethnic 
divisions and brought hope and comfort to many people. Throughout 
Ramadan, Muslims have fasted to focus their minds on faith and to direct 
their hearts to charity. Eid al-Fitr marks the completion of this holy 
month with the

Festival of Breaking the Fast. During this joyous celebration, Muslims 
thank God for his guidance and blessings by gathering with family and 
friends, sharing traditional foods, and showing compassion to those in 
need.
    America is strengthened by the countless contributions of our Muslim 
citizens, and we value our ties with Muslim nations throughout the 
world. For people of all faiths, Eid al-Fitr is an opportunity to 
reflect on the values we share and the friendships that bind all who 
trace their faith back to God's call to Abraham.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a joyous 
Eid and for health, happiness, and prosperity in the year ahead. Eid 
Mubarak.

                                                          George W. Bush
