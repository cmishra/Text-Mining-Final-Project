Exchange With Reporters in Goteborg, Sweden
June 14, 2001

European Union-U.S. Summit

    Q. Mr. President, can you share with us your message for the 
European leaders?
    The President. See, Fournier [Ron Fournier, Associated Press] asked 
you to ask that. [Laughter] I haven't made up my mind who I'm calling on 
at the press conference yet, so if you don't behave, you may not get 
called.
    Q. And chances keep diminishing. Right, sir? [Laughter]
    The President. Did you put him up to that, Ron?
    Q. I'm not that smart, sir. [Laughter]
    The President. Let me just say this: I'm honored to be the first 
United States President to come to Sweden, and I appreciate so very much 
the hospitality that we've received, and I'm so looking forward to these 
discussions. What the people of Sweden and Europe will realize is that 
mine is an administration that is deeply committed to a prosperous 
Europe and a whole Europe and a free Europe. And we look forward to a 
constructive relationship.

Note: The exchange began at 12:24 p.m. at Gunnebo Manor House, prior to 
the plenary session of the European Union-U.S. Summit. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of this exchange.
