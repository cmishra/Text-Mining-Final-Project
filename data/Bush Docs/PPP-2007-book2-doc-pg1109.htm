Remarks on the Resignation of Attorney General Alberto R. 
Gonzales<Gonzales, Alberto R.<ls-thn-eq> in Waco, Texas
August 27, 2007

    This morning Attorney General Alberto Gonzales announced that he 
will leave the Department of Justice after 2\1/2\ years of service to 
the Department. Al Gonzales is a man of integrity, decency, and 
principle. And I have reluctantly accepted his resignation, with great 
appreciation for the service that he has provided for our country.
    As Attorney General and before that as White House Counsel, Al 
Gonzales has played a critical role in shaping our policies in the war 
on terror and has worked tirelessly to make this country safer. The 
PATRIOT Act, the Military Commissions Act, and other important laws bear 
his imprint. Under his leadership, the Justice Department has made a 
priority of protecting children from Internet predators and made 
enforcement of civil rights laws a top priority. He aggressively and 
successfully pursued public corruption and effectively combated gang 
violence.
    As Attorney General, he played an important role in helping to 
confirm two fine jurists in Chief Justice John Roberts<Roberts, John G., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and Justice Samuel Alito.<Alito, Samuel A., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> He did an outstanding job as White House Counsel, 
identifying and recommending the best nominees to fill critically 
important Federal court vacancies.
    Alberto Gonzales's tenure as Attorney General and White House 
Counsel is only part of a long history of distinguished public service 
that began as a young man when, after high school, he enlisted in the 
United States Air Force. When I became Governor of Texas in 1995, I 
recruited him from one of Texas's most prestigious law firms to be my 
general counsel. He went on to become Texas's 100th secretary of state 
and to serve on our State's supreme court. In the long course of our 
work together, this trusted adviser became a close friend.
    These various positions have required sacrifice from Al, his wife 
Becky,<Gonzales, Rebecca Turner<ls-thn-eq> their sons Jared,<Gonzales, 
Jared<ls-thn-eq> Graham,<Gonzales, Graham<ls-thn-eq> and 
Gabriel.<Gonzales, Gabriel<ls-thn-eq> And I thank them for their service 
to the country.
    After months of unfair treatment that has created a harmful 
distraction at the Justice Department, Judge Gonzales decided to resign 
his position, and I accept his decision. It's sad that we live in a time 
when a talented and honorable person like Alberto Gonzales is impeded 
from doing important work because his good name was dragged through the 
mud for political reasons.
    I've asked Solicitor General Paul Clement<Clement, Paul 
D.<ls-thn-eq> to serve as Acting Attorney General upon Alberto 
Gonzales's departure and until a nominee has been confirmed by the 
Senate. He's agreed to do so. Paul is one of the finest lawyers in 
America. As Solicitor General, Paul has developed a reputation for 
excellence and fairness and earned the respect and confidence of the 
entire Justice Department.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:50 a.m. at the Texas State Technical 
College Airport. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a 
Spanish language transcript of these remarks.
