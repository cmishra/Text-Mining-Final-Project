Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency 
Regarding Export Control Regulations
July 23, 2008

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the 
Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice, stating that the 
emergency caused by the lapse of the Export Administration Act of 1979, 
as amended, is to continue in effect for 1 year beyond August 17, 2008.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 July 23, 2008.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
July 24. The notice of July 23 is listed in Appendix D at the end of 
this volume.
