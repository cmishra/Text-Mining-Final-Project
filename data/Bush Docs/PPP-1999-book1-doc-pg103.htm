Statement on BP Amoco's Efforts To Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
January 25, 1999

    I commend BP Amoco and its chief executive, John Browne,<Browne, 
John> for once again demonstrating the kind of corporate 
leadership needed to meet two of our most pressing environmental 
challenges--air pollution and global warming.
    Last fall British Petroleum set a new standard in corporate 
responsibility by voluntarily pledging to reduce dramatically its 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Today BP Amoco extended this pledge to 
cover Amoco's production facilities as well. These commitments 
demonstrate that leading corporations can serve their investors and 
their customers, even as they join us in the fight against global 
warming.
    Also today, BP Amoco announced plans to market cleaner fuels in 40 
cities around the world to help improve local air quality. By using the 
latest technology to custom tailor fuels to address the unique pollution 
concerns of these cities, the company will help produce cleaner, 
healthier air for millions of people worldwide. And it is helping to 
build the kind of partnership between the fuel and automotive industries 
that will be needed to deliver clean, efficient transportation for the 
21st century.
    With today's announcements, BP Amoco offers further proof that a 
strong economy and a healthy environment go hand in hand. Working 
together, we can ensure that future generations breathe cleaner air, and 
we can protect them from the grave risks of global warming.
