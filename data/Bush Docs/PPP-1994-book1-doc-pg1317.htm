Message to the Senate Transmitting the Labor Administration Convention
July 26, 1994

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith a certified copy of the Convention 
(No. 150) Concerning Labor Administration: Role, Functions and 
Organization, adopted by the International Labor Conference at its 64th 
Session in Geneva on June 7, 1978.
    The report of the Department of State, with a letter from the 
Secretary of Labor, concerning the Convention is enclosed.
    As explained more fully in the enclosed letter from the Secretary of 
Labor, the current system of labor administration in the United States 
fully satisfies the requirements of Convention No. 150. Ratification of 
this Convention, therefore, would not require the United States to alter 
its law or practice in this field.
    Ratification of additional International Labor Organization (ILO) 
conventions will enhance the ability of the United States to take other 
governments to task for failing to comply with the ILO instruments they 
have ratified. I recommend that the Senate give its advice and consent 
to the ratification of ILO Convention No. 150.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 26, 1994.
