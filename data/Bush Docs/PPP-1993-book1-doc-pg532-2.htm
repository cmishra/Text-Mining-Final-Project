Nomination for Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
April 28, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Arthur 
Levitt, Jr., owner of the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call and formerly 
chairman of the American Stock Exchange, as a member of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. Once Mr. Levitt is confirmed as a member, the 
President intends to designate him Chairman of the SEC.
    ``Backed by 20 years of experience in high finance and newly 
introduced to the workings of Capitol Hill, Arthur Levitt is well 
prepared to take the helm at the SEC,'' the President said. ``I have 
full confidence he will use his office wisely to strengthen public 
confidence in our country's financial agencies.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
