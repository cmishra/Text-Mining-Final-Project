Statement on House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's Support for 
Legislation on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
December 21, 1993

    I welcome Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's support for the 
implementation of the Uruguay round agreement. His statement reflects 
the fact that we have a strong agreement that promises important 
benefits for U.S. industry, services, and agriculture. The majority 
leader's support will help make it possible to implement the agreement 
expeditiously, with a strong base of congressional support.
    The overriding commitment of this administration in trade policy has 
been to open markets and expand trade--multilaterally where possible, 
and bilaterally where necessary--and to enforce trade laws against 
unfair trade practices by other

trading nations. The successful Uruguay round result strengthens our 
hand in doing so, and I look forward to working with the majority leader 
and others in Congress on the implementing legislation.
