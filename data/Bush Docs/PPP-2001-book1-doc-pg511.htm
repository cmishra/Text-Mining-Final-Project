Remarks Honoring the NCAA Men's Hockey Champion Boston College Eagles
May 10, 2001

    Well, thank you all very much. Welcome to the White House. My honor 
to host you. I know some of the players up here are from Canada. I hope 
you feel just as welcome in this house as your U.S. counterparts do.
    I want to thank Father Leahy<Leahy, William P.<ls-thn-eq> for being 
here. I want to thank the athletic director.<DeFilippo, Eugene 
B.<ls-thn-eq> Of course, I want to thank Coach York.<York, Jeremiah 
F.<ls-thn-eq> It's an honor for me to host the mighty Eagles. One of the 
great benefits of having my job is, I do get to welcome championship 
teams from all across our country. As a Governor of Texas, the truth of 
the matter is, I didn't get to welcome a lot of hockey teams. [Laughter]
    I'm also pleased to see some folks who sometimes think I--on thin 
ice. [Laughter] I think they know who I'm talking about.
    Senator Kerry,<Kerry, John F.<ls-thn-eq> thank you for being here, 
sir. I appreciate Representatives Frank<Frank, Barney<ls-thn-eq> and 
Markey.<Markey, Edward J.<ls-thn-eq> I appreciate Representative 
Capuano.<Capuano, Michael E.<ls-thn-eq> I'm glad you all are here. One 
of the things that happens sometimes in politics is, we disagree. But I 
think we're learning to disagree in an agreeable way. So you're welcome 
to the people's house.
    I also want to welcome my friend Ambassador Paul Cellucci.<Cellucci, 
Paul<ls-thn-eq> I made a good pick when I picked Paul to become the 
Ambassador to Canada. He, of course, takes credit for the fact that the 
BC Eagles won the national championship, since he was the Governor at 
the time.
    Also before I turn to the coach,<York, Jeremiah F.<ls-thn-eq> want 
to remind folks that my sister<Koch, Dorothy Bush<ls-thn-eq> is a BC 
Eagle, and proudly so. She's probably wondering why I didn't invite her 
here today. [Laughter]

    This is a great place to honor champs. It's also a great place to 
play sports. We've got a basketball court here. There's a bowling alley. 
There is a swimming pool. Recently, there was a baseball yard for a tee-
ball game. I asked them why there's no hockey rink, and the truth of the 
matter is, Coach,<York, Jeremiah F.<ls-thn-eq> there's no place to park 
the Zamboni. [Laughter]
    But I do want to congratulate you all for a great victory and a 
great championship. I know your win over North Dakota was a tough win. 
But I want to quote what one of your players said, Mark 
McLennan.<McLennan, Mark<ls-thn-eq> Where are you, Mark? He said this 
about the team: ``There were no egos on this team. We had great 
individual players, but nothing was bigger than the team.'' And that's 
why you're the champs. I want to congratulate you all for being champs.
    I want to remind you that life is more than just being champs on the 
ice. It's important to be a champ off the ice, as well. I'm sure there's 
some little kid up there in the Boston area wondering how a champ 
behaves off the ice, and you have the responsibility as a champion to 
set the right example.
    Coach,<York, Jeremiah F.<ls-thn-eq> welcome to the White House. 
Congratulations for being here.

Note: The President spoke at 5:10 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Rev. William P. Leahy, S.J., 
president, Jeremiah F. York, hockey coach, and Eugene B. DeFilippo, 
athletic director, Boston College; and Dorothy Bush Koch, the 
President's sister.
