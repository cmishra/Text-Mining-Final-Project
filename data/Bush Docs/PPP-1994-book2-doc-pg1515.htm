Remarks on the Northern Ireland Peace Process to the Irish Media on
Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts
September 2, 1994

    Let me say first of all, I am so pleased to have Dick Spring here. 
And I'm pleased that he came across the ocean to visit with me and 
others in the United States who very much want this process to succeed.
    I am delighted by the developments of the last several days and by 
all the efforts that have been made in the last few months. The United 
States is strongly supportive of this peace process. We want to reach 
out and work with all the elements in Ireland, in Northern Ireland. We 
want all the communities to feel a part of the peace process and to feel 
that there is a peace dividend. We want to continue to work with and 
support the work of the Government of Ireland and the Government of 
Great Britain. And we are prepared to take some steps to do whatever we 
can to help that now.
    Dick is going to talk at greater length about some of the specific 
things we talked about here today, but the United States has tried to be 
a friend of peace in Ireland, and we will continue to do that. And we're 
very, very pleased by the developments.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 11 a.m. at the Friedman Guest 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Foreign Minister Richard Spring of 
Ireland. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
these remarks.
