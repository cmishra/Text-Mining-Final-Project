Memorandum on the Federal Worker 2000 Presidential Initiative
July 2, 1999

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Federal Worker 2000 Presidential Initiative

    Each year, Federal employees suffer over 160,000 injuries or 
illnesses in the course of their employment. The Federal Government's 
bill for medical treatment and wage loss compensation costs exceeds $1.9 
billion each year. Even more disturbing is the pain and suffering of 
employees and their families that is caused by these injuries and 
illnesses and the fact that many of such injuries and illnesses are 
preventable.
    The Federal workforce is a valuable asset to our healthy economy. We 
need to do more to protect our dedicated public servants from 
preventable injuries and illnesses. From this point

forward, I want to make the safety and health of every Federal worker a 
central value in each operation performed in Federal workplaces. I ask 
all Federal agencies to help make Federal Government workplaces safe and 
productive. Furthermore, we need to ensure that, when injuries do occur, 
Federal employees are given the best possible care and are returned to 
work as quickly as possible.
    To this end I direct the Secretary of Labor to lead an initiative 
focusing on the Federal workplace. This initiative will have a duration 
of 5 years, and will establish 3 measurable goals:
  <bullet>  reducing the overall occurrence of injuries by 3 percent per 
            year, while improving the timeliness of reporting of 
            injuries and illnesses by agencies to the Department of 
            Labor by 5 percent per year;
  <bullet>  for those work sites with the highest rates of serious 
            injuries, reducing the occurrence of such injuries by 10 
            percent per year; and
  <bullet>  reducing the rate of lost production days (i.e. the number 
            of days employees spend away from work) by 2 percent per 
            year.
    I also direct the Secretary to report to me each year on the 
progress made to reduce work-related injuries and illnesses, to provide 
timely services, and to reduce the number of days injured workers are 
away from their jobs.
    I am convinced that this new focus on safety and health in the 
Federal Government will result in fewer injured workers, significant 
cost reductions, and an enhanced ability to serve the American public.

                                                      William J. Clinton
