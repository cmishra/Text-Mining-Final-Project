Nomination for United States District Court Judges
October 29, 1993

    The President today announced the nominations of three U.S. District 
Court judges from the State of Florida. The President named Henry Adams 
and Susan Bucklew for the Middle District of Florida and Theodore Klein 
for the Southern District of Florida.
    With these nominations, the President has nominated 32 men and women 
for Federal judgeships. At the same point in their administrations, 
President Bush had named 18; President Reagan had named 27; and 
President Carter had named 26 judicial nominees.
    ``All of these nominees have demonstrated the qualities that will 
make them valuable additions to the Federal bench for years to come,'' 
said the President.

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
