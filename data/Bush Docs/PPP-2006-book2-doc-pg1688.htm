Message on the Observance of Rosh Hashanah, 5767
September 21, 2006

    I send greetings to those around the world celebrating Rosh 
Hashanah.
    During these holy days, Jewish people begin the new year by 
answering the call of the Shofar and gathering in synagogues. It is a 
time to reflect on the past, celebrate the beginning of life, and 
welcome the promise of the future with a spirit of renewal and hope.
    On this sacred holiday, I appreciate the Jewish people for your 
efforts to ensure that your values and traditions are passed on to 
future generations. As you begin the Days of Awe, your faith in the 
Almighty reminds us of the gift of religious freedom in our country and 
helps make the world a more hopeful place.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a 
peaceful Rosh Hashanah.

                                                          George W. Bush
