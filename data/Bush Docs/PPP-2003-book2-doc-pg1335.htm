Statement on Congressional Passage of the Supplemental Funding Request 
To Support the War on Terror
October 17, 2003

    I applaud the House and Senate for passing my supplemental funding 
request to support our mission and our troops deployed in Afghanistan, 
Iraq, and elsewhere. These funds will provide the resources necessary to 
make Iraq more secure and support its transition to self-government, 
which is critical to winning the war on terror. They will also continue 
our efforts to help build an Afghanistan that is prosperous, democratic, 
and at peace, and that contributes to regional stability.
    I commend the House for wisely rejecting a proposal to convert part 
of the reconstruction funds to loans. It is unfortunate that a closely 
divided Senate voted to partially substitute loans for grants. Loans are 
the wrong approach--they would slow the reconstruction of Iraq, delay 
the democratic process, and send the wrong message to both the region 
and the world. The loan provision must be removed in conference.
    I thank Chairmen Stevens<Stevens, Ted<ls-thn-eq> and Young<Young, 
C.W. Bill<ls-thn-eq> for their efforts and urge the conference committee 
to work to resolve their differences, fully fund my request, and send me 
legislation I can sign quickly.
