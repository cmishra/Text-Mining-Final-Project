Remarks on Signing the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act 
of 2001
June 7, 2001

    Thank you. Sit down. Behave yourself. You're at the White House. 
[Laughter]
    Laura,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much for being here on 
this historic moment. Mr. Vice President,<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> 
Secretary O'Neill,<O'Neill, Paul H.<ls-thn-eq> Director 
Daniels,<Daniels, Mitchell E., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Secretary Evans<Evans, 
Donald L.<ls-thn-eq> and Chao<Chao, Elaine L.<ls-thn-eq> are here, as 
well. Secretary Abraham,<Abraham, Spencer<ls-thn-eq> Administrator 
Christine Todd Whitman,<Whitman, Christine Todd<ls-thn-eq> Members of 
the United States Senate, Members of the House of Representatives, 
fellow Americans, welcome.
    Some months ago, in my speech to the joint session of Congress, I 
had the honor of introducing Steven Ramos<Ramos, Steven<ls-thn-eq> to 
the Nation. Steven is the network administrator for a school district. 
His wife, Josefina,<Ramos, Josefina<ls-thn-eq> teaches at a charter 
school. They have a little girl named Lianna,<Ramos, Lianna<ls-thn-eq> 
and they're trying to save for Lianna's college education. High taxes 
made saving difficult. Last year they paid nearly $8,000 in Federal 
income taxes. Well, today we're beginning to make life for the Ramos' a 
lot easier. Today we start to return some of the Ramos' money and not 
only their money but the money of everybody who paid taxes in the United 
States of America.
    Across the board tax relief does not happen often in Washington, DC. 
In fact, since World War II, it has happened only twice: President 
Kennedy's tax cut in the sixties and President Reagan's tax cuts in the 
1980s. And now it's happening for the third time, and it's about time.
    A year ago tax relief was said to be a political impossibility. Six 
months ago it was supposed to be a political liability. Today it becomes 
reality. It becomes reality because of the bipartisan leadership of the 
Members of the United States Congress, Members like Bill Thomas<Thomas, 
William M.<ls-thn-eq> of California, Ralph Hall<Hall, Ralph 
M.<ls-thn-eq> of Texas, Charles Grassley<Grassley, Charles E.<ls-thn-eq> 
of Iowa, Max Baucus<Baucus, Max<ls-thn-eq> of Montana, Zell 
Miller<Miller, Zell<ls-thn-eq> of Georgia, John Breaux<Breaux, John 
B.<ls-thn-eq> of Louisiana, Trent Lott<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> of 
Mississippi and the entire leadership team in the Senate, and Denny 
Hastert<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> of Illinois and the leadership 
team in the House of Representatives--some Democrats, many Republicans--
who worked tirelessly and effectively to produce this important result.
    I also want to pay tribute to the members of my administration who 
worked with Congress to bring about this day: Vice President 
Cheney,<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> Secretary O'Neill,<O'Neill, Paul 
H.<ls-thn-eq> Director Daniels,<Daniels, Mitchell E., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and 
the team inside the White House of Andy Card<Card, Andrew H., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and Larry Lindsey,<Lindsey, Larry<ls-thn-eq> Nick 
Calio,<Calio, Nick<ls-thn-eq> and their staffs.
    With us today are 15 of the many families I met as I toured our 
country making the case for tax relief--hard-working Americans. I was 
able to talk about their stories and their struggles and their hopes, 
which made the case for tax relief much stronger than my words could 
possible convey. And I want to thank you all for coming.
    And here at the White House today are representatives of millions of 
Americans, including labor union members, small-business owners, and 
family farmers. Your persistence and determination helped bring us to 
this day. The American people should be proud of your efforts on their 
behalf, and I personally thank you all for coming.
    Tax relief is a great achievement for the American people. Tax 
relief is the first

achievement produced by the new tone in Washington, and it was produced 
in record time.
    Tax relief is an achievement for families struggling to enter the 
middle class. For hard-working lower income families, we have cut the 
bottom rate of Federal income tax from 15 percent to 10 percent. We 
doubled the per-child tax credit to $1,000 and made it refundable. Tax 
relief is compassionate, and it is now on the way.
    Tax relief is an achievement for middle class families squeezed by 
high energy prices and credit card debt. Most families can look forward 
to a $600 tax rebate before they have to pay the September back-to-
school bills. And in the years ahead, taxpayers can look forward to 
steadily declining income tax rates.
    Tax relief is an achievement for families that want the Government 
tax policy to be fair and not penalize them for making good choices, 
good choices such as marriage and raising a family. So we cut the 
marriage penalty.
    Tax relief makes the code more fair for small businesses and farmers 
and individuals by eliminating the death tax. Over the long haul, tax 
relief will encourage work and innovation. It will allow American 
workers to save more on their pension plan or individual retirement 
accounts.
    Tax relief expands individual freedom. The money we return, or don't 
take in the first place, can be saved for a child's education, spent on 
family needs, invested in a home or in a business or a mutual fund or 
used to reduce personal debt.
    The message we send today: It's up to the American people; it's the 
American people's choice. We recognize, loud and clear, the surplus is 
not the Government's money. The surplus is the people's money, and we 
ought to trust them with their own money.
    This tax relief plan is principled. We cut taxes for every income-
tax payer. We target nobody in; we target nobody out. And tax relief is 
now on the way.
    Today is a great day for America. It is the first major achievement 
of a new era, an era of steady cooperation. And more achievements are 
ahead. I thank the Members of Congress in both parties who made today 
possible. Together, we will lead our country to new progress and new 
possibilities.
    It is now my honor to sign the first broad tax relief in a 
generation.

Note: The President spoke at 9:58 a.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. H.R. 1836, approved June 7, was assigned Public Law No. 107-16.
