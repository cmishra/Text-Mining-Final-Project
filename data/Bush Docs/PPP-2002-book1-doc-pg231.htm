Statement on Proposed Pension Security Legislation
February 14, 2002

    I applaud Congressmen John Boehner<Boehner, John A.> and 
Sam Johnson<Johnson, Sam> for introducing legislation today to 
strengthen the retirement security of American workers. Consistent with 
the principles that I outlined at the beginning of this month, their 
bill would protect workers by giving them freedom to manage their own 
retirement savings, fair notice of any blackout period, and better 
access to sound investment advice. This bill also assures that corporate 
officers would be held to the same restrictions as those imposed on 
workers.
    This bill, and other good legislation like that introduced by 
Congressmen Portman<Portman, Rob> and Cardin,<Cardin, Benjamin 
L.> will help provide economic security to both workers and 
shareholders. I look forward to working with the Congress in a 
bipartisan fashion to enact these important protections into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 3762, the ``Pension Security Act of 
2002,'' and H.R. 3669, the ``Employee Retirement Savings Bill of 
Rights.''
