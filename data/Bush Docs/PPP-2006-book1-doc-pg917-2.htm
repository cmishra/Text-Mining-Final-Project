Remarks on the Terrorist Surveillance Program
May 11, 2006

    After September the 11th, I vowed to the American people that our 
Government would do everything within the law to protect them against 
another terrorist attack. As part of this effort, I authorized the 
National Security Agency to intercept the international communications 
of people with known links to Al Qaida and related terrorist 
organizations. In other words, if Al Qaida or their associates are 
making calls into the United States or out of the United States, we want 
to know what they're saying.
    Today there are new claims about other ways we are tracking down Al 
Qaida to prevent attacks on America. I want to make some important 
points about what the Government is doing and what the Government is not 
doing.
    First, our intelligence activities strictly target Al Qaida and 
their known affiliates. Al Qaida is our enemy, and we want to know their 
plans. Second, the Government does not listen to domestic phone calls 
without court approval. Third, the intelligence activities I authorized 
are lawful and have been briefed to appropriate Members of Congress, 
both Republican and Democrat. Fourth, the privacy of ordinary Americans 
is fiercely protected in all our activities.
    We're not mining or trolling through the personal lives of millions 
of innocent Americans. Our efforts are focused on links to Al Qaida and 
their known affiliates. So far we've been very successful in preventing 
another attack on our soil.
    As a general matter, every time sensitive intelligence is leaked, it 
hurts our ability to defeat this enemy. Our most important job is to 
protect the American people from another attack, and we will do so 
within the laws of our country.
    Thank you.
