Statement on the Tokyo, Japan, Group of Eight Meeting
July 20, 2000

    At today's unprecedented meeting in Tokyo, G-8 leaders met with 
leaders from developing nations and representatives from the private 
sector and international development institutions. While I regret that I 
was unable to participate, I look forward to hearing from Secretary 
Summers<Summers, Lawrence H.> and my G-8 colleagues about the 
discussion and working to ensure that everyone benefits from the global 
economy.
    Building on last year's Cologne debt initiative, the Okinawa summit 
will create a framework to fight infectious disease, increase access to 
basic education, and expand opportunity through information technology. 
Despite a stronger global economy, too many people around the world live 
every day without essential health care, basic literacy, or the 
opportunity to share in the benefits of modern technology. I am 
committed to continuing to work closely with America's partners in the 
G-8 and the developing world to address these issues, reduce poverty, 
fight infectious disease, and increase opportunity for all.
