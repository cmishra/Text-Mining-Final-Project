Statement on the Retirement of General Ronald R. Fogleman as Air Force 
Chief of Staff
July 28, 1997

    Today General Ronald Fogleman, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air 
Force, announced that he plans to retire in September, after 34 years of 
active duty service.
    It has been a great privilege for me to work closely with General 
Fogleman over the last 3 years. I want to take this opportunity to 
commend this extraordinary officer for his dedicated service to our 
Nation. For over three decades, in war and peace, General Fogleman has 
demonstrated his inspirational leadership and dedication to the men and 
women of the Air Force. As Chief of Staff, his clear vision and tireless 
championship of air and space power have shaped the U.S. Air Force for 
the challenges of the 21st century. These are his legacies.
    General Fogleman's leadership and wise counsel will truly be missed 
in the senior decision-making ranks of our national security structure. 
Hillary and I wish him and Miss Jane the very best.
