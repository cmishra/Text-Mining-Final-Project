Statement on the 10th Anniversary of Terrorist Attacks Against U.S. 
Embassies in Africa
August 7, 2008

    Today marks the tenth anniversary of the Al Qaida terrorist attacks 
against U.S. Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. 
In Dar es Salaam, the terrorists killed 11 people and wounded more than 
85 others. The blast in Nairobi killed 218 people and injured 
approximately 5,000. We remember today those who lost their lives or 
were injured in the attacks, their families, and their loved ones.
    The attacks in East Africa are brutal examples of Al Qaida's tactics 
in its war against innocent people worldwide, carried out in the heart 
of two African capitals without regard to the race, creed, or 
nationality of the victims. This has been Al Qaida's method for more 
than a decade, indiscriminately attacking civilians throughout the 
world. The attacks in Kenya and Tanzania remind us that Al Qaida and its 
terrorist affiliates continue to want to attack the United States and 
our allies. This anniversary reinforces the need to confront the 
terrorists, to work with our allies to bring them to justice, and to 
prevent such attacks from happening again.
