Remarks in Knoxville on the Middle East Situation
April 8, 2002

    Let me say one thing before I leave. First of all, I meant what I 
said to the Prime Minister<Sharon, Ariel> of Israel. I expect 
there to be withdrawal without delay. And I also meant what I said to 
the Arab world, that in order for there to be peace, nations must stand 
up, leaders must stand up and condemn terrorism, terrorist activity.
    There is a mutual responsibility to achieve peace, and it's going to 
require leadership on both sides. And the United States is firmly 
committed to achieving peace and is firmly committed--I am firmly 
committed to what I expect from both parties.
    I repeat, I meant what I said about withdrawal without delay, and I 
mean what I say when I call upon the Arab world to strongly condemn and 
act against terrorist activity.

Note: The President spoke at 12:06 p.m. at the Knoxville Police 
Department Training Facility following a tour of the Citizens Police 
Academy. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of 
Israel.
