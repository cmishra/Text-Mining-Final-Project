Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Radiation Control for 
Health and Safety
April 8, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 540 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic (FDC) Act (21 U.S.C. 360qq) (previously section 360D of the 
Public Health Service Act), I am submitting the report of the Department 
of Health and Human Services regarding the administration of the 
Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 during calendar year 
1995.
    The report recommends the repeal of section 540 of the FDC Act, 
which requires the completion of this annual report. All the information 
found in this report is available to the Congress on a more immediate 
basis through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health technical 
reports, the Center's Home Page Internet Site, and other publicly 
available sources. Agency resources devoted to the preparation of this 
report should be put to other, better uses.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

April 8, 1997.
