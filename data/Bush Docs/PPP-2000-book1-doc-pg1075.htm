Russia-United States Joint Statement Concerning Management and 
Disposition of Excess Weapon-Grade Plutonium and Related Cooperation
June 4, 2000

    The Presidents of the United States and the Russian 
Federation<Putin, Vladimir<ls-thn-eq> announced today completion of the 
bilateral Agreement for the management and disposition of weapon-grade 
plutonium withdrawn from their respective nuclear weapon programs and 
declared excess to defense purposes. This Agreement will ensure that 
this plutonium will be changed into forms unusable for nuclear weapons 
by consumption as fuel in nuclear reactors or by immobilization 
rendering it suitable for geologic disposal.

    Based on the 1998 Summit Joint Statement of Principles for 
Management and Disposition of Plutonium, this Agreement charts the 
course and sets the conditions for such activities. It reconfirms our 
determination to take steps necessary to ensure that it is never again 
used for nuclear weapons or any other military purpose and is managed 
and disposed in a way that is safe, secure, ecologically sound, 
transparent and irreversible. It reaffirms our commitment to nuclear 
disarmament.

    This Agreement will ensure that the management and disposition 
activities are monitored and, thus, transparent for the international 
community. It provides for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
verification once appropriate agreements with the IAEA are concluded.

    This Agreement builds on the approaches to such plutonium management 
and disposition agreed at the 1996 G-8 Moscow Nuclear Safety and 
Security Summit. We reaffirm our intentions to continue to work closely 
with other countries, in particular other G-8 leaders, who have provided 
strong support over past years for initiation and implementation of 
these programs. In this regard, we hope that significant progress will 
be made as well at the G-8 Summit this July in Okinawa.

    This Agreement will enable new cooperation to go forward between the 
United States and the Russian Federation. We note that the United States 
Congress has appropriated 200 million USD for this cooperation and the 
U.S. Administration intends to seek additional appropriations.

    This Agreement will soon be signed by Vice President Gore<Gore, 
Albert, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and Prime Minister Kasyanov.<Kasyanov, 
Mikhail<ls-thn-eq>
