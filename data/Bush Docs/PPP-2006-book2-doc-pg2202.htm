Message Sending Holiday Greetings to Members of the Armed Forces
December 18, 2006

To the Men and Women of the United States Armed Forces

    On behalf of all Americans, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send 
our best holiday wishes to you and your families.
    During this hopeful time of year, the hearts of Americans are filled 
with gratitude for the many blessings in our lives. We are especially 
thankful for the priceless gift of freedom that our Armed Forces help 
defend by serving the cause of peace and standing watch over our 
security. As courageous Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast 
Guardsmen, you have set aside comfort and convenience to protect the 
rest of us, earning the respect of a grateful Nation and a proud 
Commander in Chief.
    Many of you are confronting our adversaries abroad and observing the 
holidays in places far from home, but you are close to our hearts. You 
are serving at a time when our Nation needs you, and your fellow 
citizens appreciate the many sacrifices that you and your families are 
making every day. Over the holidays and throughout the New Year, we will 
continue to ask the Almighty to bestow His care on you and your loved 
ones.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish each of you a safe and 
joyous holiday season. May God bless and watch over you, and may God 
bless America.

                                                          George W. Bush
