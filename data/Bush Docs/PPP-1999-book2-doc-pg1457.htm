Statement on the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
August 18, 1999

    Today's 1998 national household survey on drug abuse reveals that we 
have turned an important corner on youth drug use. Last year youth drug 
use declined significantly, and fewer young people tried marijuana for 
the first time. This encouraging news shows that more young people are 
getting the message that drugs are wrong and illegal and can kill you, 
and today's report contains even more good news: Current cigarette use 
dropped to the lowest rate ever recorded by the survey.
    While these results give us reason to be optimistic, we cannot let 
up on our efforts. We must continue our unprecedented media campaign to 
reach our children with powerful antidrug messages, not cut it back just 
as it is making an impact. We must expand our partnerships with 
community antidrug coalitions and work to enact our long-term drug 
strategy. Together, we can steer our children away from drugs and toward 
a brighter future.
