Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process
February 20, 1998

    Today's decision to suspend Sinn Fein from the Northern Ireland 
peace talks shows that the UK and Irish Governments are committed to an 
inclusive process but one that reaffirms that it is unacceptable to mix 
politics and violence.
    Peace in Northern Ireland is best served if all the political 
leaders of Northern Ireland work to find common ground to make common 
cause for peace. The United States stands with those who support peace 
and against those extremists on both sides who will use all the means at 
their disposal to sabotage a peaceful settlement that the vast majority 
of both communities, and countries, support. I call on Sinn Fein to take 
the necessary steps to rejoin the talks and for all parties to reject 
violence and demonstrate in word and deed commitment to the Mitchell 
principles that exclusively peaceful means are the only way forward.
