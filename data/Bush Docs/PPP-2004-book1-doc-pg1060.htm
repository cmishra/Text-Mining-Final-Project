Remarks at the Congressional Barbecue
June 15, 2004

    Thank you all for coming. So the Vice President and I were sitting 
around saying, ``I wonder if we can get some people to come to a 
barbecue here on the South Lawn.'' We're glad you came. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I and Lynne<Cheney, Lynne<ls-thn-eq> and 
Dick<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> are really pleased to host you all for the 
annual Congressional Barbecue. We want to thank the Rich Davis<Davis, 
Rich<ls-thn-eq>family from Kansas City for providing the barbecue and 
the White House staff for providing the napkins. [Laughter]
    I think the best thing I can tell you is how much I appreciate the 
families of the Members of Congress for supporting your husbands and 
wives and moms and dads as they serve our great country. It is a--the 
Members of Congress work really hard on behalf of the people of the 
country. And they're gone a lot from their homes, and I know it's hard. 
It's hard to wonder whether or not the service is worth it. I'm telling 
you, the service is worth it. We are a great nation because men and 
women from all walks of life are willing to serve our country. So we 
really appreciate you being here.
    I also want to thank the Marine Band, the Army Band, the Navy Band, 
the Air Force Band, and the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps for providing 
the entertainment tonight.
    And our wish is that you enjoy yourself on the beautiful South Lawn 
of this majestic house that Laura and I are fortunate to live in. Every 
day we are reminded about the greatness of our country, and we are a 
great country. We're a great country because we believe in human dignity 
and the rights of every person. We're a great country because we believe 
that no matter who you are or where you're from, you can succeed in 
America. We're a great country because free men and women can self-
govern in a peaceful way, and we're a great country because we are 
blessed by the Almighty God.
    Thank you all for coming. May God bless. Enjoy yourself.

Note: The President spoke at 6:15 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Rich Davis, founder, KC 
Masterpiece Barbecue and Grill restaurants.
