Statement on Emergency Assistance to the Northeast Fishing Industry
March 21, 1994

    New England's fisheries are experiencing a virtual collapse, 
threatening the livelihoods of thousands of New Englanders. The first 
step to recovery is to restore the supply of fish, and we are working to 
do that by restricting fishing. But we must address the economic impact 
that is being felt by individuals, businesses, and communities. These 
resources are targeted to specific programs that will help the industry, 
help people, and help communities get back on their feet.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
emergency supplemental appropriations to assist the Northeast fishing 
industry and communities affected by the collapse of Northeast 
commercial fisheries.
