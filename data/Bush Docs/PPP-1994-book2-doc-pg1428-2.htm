Appointment for the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and 
Technology
August 3, 1994

    The President today announced the membership of a private-sector 
committee to advise him on major science and technology issues and to 
help guide Federal investments in science and technology toward national 
goals. The 18-member President's Committee of Advisors on Science and 
Technology (PCAST) is composed of top-level representatives from 
industry, education and research institutions, and nongovernmental 
organizations.
    ``I am very pleased to name these eminent scientists, engineers, 
business leaders, and educators as some of my key advisers,'' the 
President said. ``Drawn from a cross-section of America, they will help 
ensure that our science and technology policies reflect our Nation's 
needs: health, prosperity based on long-term economic growth and 
technological investment, national security, environmental 
responsibility, and improved quality of life.''
    The appointment of private-sector advisers to the President 
highlights the administration's goal of fostering public/private 
partnerships to achieve national science and education goals. ``To 
achieve our goals, we must strengthen partnerships with industry, with 
State and local governments, and with schools, colleges, and 
universities across the country,'' said the President. ``My goal for 
this committee is to help encourage those partnerships.''
