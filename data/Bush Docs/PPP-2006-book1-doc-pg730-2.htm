Statement Supporting Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld<Rumsfeld, 
Donald H.<ls-thn-eq>
April 14, 2006

    Earlier today I spoke with Don Rumsfeld about ongoing military 
operations in the global war on terror. I reiterated my strong support 
for his leadership during this historic and challenging time for our 
Nation.
    The Department of Defense has been tasked with many difficult 
missions. Upon assuming office, I asked Don to transform the largest 
department in our Government. That kind of change is hard, but our 
Nation must have a military that is fully prepared to confront the 
dangerous threats of the 21st century. Don and our military commanders 
have also been tasked to take the fight to the enemy abroad on multiple 
fronts.
    I have seen firsthand how Don relies upon our military commanders in 
the field and at the Pentagon to make decisions about how best to 
complete these missions.
    Secretary Rumsfeld's energetic and steady leadership is exactly what 
is needed at this critical period. He has my full support and deepest 
appreciation.
