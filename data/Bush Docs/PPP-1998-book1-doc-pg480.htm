Statement on the Death of Bella Abzug
March 31, 1998

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of former 
Congresswoman Bella Abzug.
    Bella Abzug was a great American and a true citizen of the world. 
Her conscience, intellect, and political acumen made an immeasurable 
contribution to our public life. She raised her passionate and tireless 
voice demanding the best for women, for all Americans, and indeed, for 
people all around the world. She will be sorely missed.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends.
