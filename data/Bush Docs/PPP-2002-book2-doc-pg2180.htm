Reporters
December 10, 2002

    President Bush. Mr. Chairman, welcome to the home of one of your 
country's best friends and allies. We're impressed by the leadership--
your leadership and your party's strong victory. We thank you very much 
for your commitment to democracy and freedom.
    We join you, side by side, in your desire to become a member of the 
European Union. We appreciate your friendship in NATO. You're a 
strategic ally and friend of the United States, and we look forward to 
working with you to keep the peace.
    It's my honor to welcome you to America.
    Chairman Erdogan. I thank you very much. We're very happy to be in 
the United States, who is our ally and friend, and it's also another 
source of happiness for us that Mr. President spare the time to meet 
with us.

    Undoubtedly, we see our bid to European Union membership as the most 
important modernization project of our country since the establishment 
of the Republic. And this will serve as a great jump-start for 
democracy, enhancement of democracy.
    This week is a very important one for us. This is actually a turning 
point in our history. It's also very meaningful that this turning point 
merged with our--coincided with our new established Government and our 
election victory. We're aware of your support on this matter, and we are 
very appreciative of this. But it shouldn't end here. We expect that to 
continue, of course, now--[laughter].
    President Bush. Well, thank you all.
    Q. Sir, can we ask----
    President Bush. Not today. But you know something? I appreciate the 
effort. [Laughter]
    Q. O for two today----
    President Bush. Well, you know something, it's good for you--brings 
discipline. Right, Randy [Randall Mikkelsen, Reuters]? If I answer 
questions every time you ask one, expectations would be high. And as you 
know, I like to keep expectations low. [Laughter]

Turkey's Bid To Enter the European Union

    Q. ----expect some phone call for European Union?
    President Bush. I made a lot of phone calls already. My 
administration is working hard on Turkey's behalf.

Note: The President spoke at 1:15 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. Chairman Erdogan's Adalet ve Kalkinma Party (Justice and 
Development Party) won a majority of the Turkish Parliament in the 
elections of November 3. A portion of these remarks could not be 
verified because the tape was incomplete.
