Letter to President Hu Jintao<Hu Jintao<ls-thn-eq> on China's First 
Human Space Mission
October 19, 2003

Dear Mr. President:
    On behalf of the American people, I congratulate you and the Chinese 
people on the successful completion of China's first human space 
mission. I was pleased to learn that Lieutenant Colonel Yang Liwei<Yang 
Liwei<ls-thn-eq> returned safely to earth. This mission was an historic 
triumph for the Chinese people and a milestone in the continued 
exploration of space.
    The United States of America warmly welcomes the People's Republic 
of China's achievement in becoming only the third country to launch an 
astronaut into space, and wishes you continued success in this endeavor.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
