Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Report on Science, 
Technology and American Diplomacy
March 20, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    I am pleased to transmit this annual report on Science, Technology 
and American Diplomacy for fiscal year 1995, in accordance with Title V 
of the Foreign Relations Act of Fiscal Year 1979, as amended (Public Law 
95-426; 22 U.S.C. 2656c(b)).
    Science and technology (S&T) are central to the goals of economic 
security, military strength, and diplomatic engagement--the vital 
elements of national security. The wisdom of our investments in S&T will 
significantly affect our ability to meet our national security 
challenges as we move into the next century. International cooperation 
in S&T serves to prevent and mitigate threats to society, increase 
exports of U.S. technologies, and promote sustainable development.
    The Title V report provides the context for international science 
and technology cooperation in the implementation of our foreign policy. 
This year's streamlined report presents an overview of current U.S. S&T 
policy, S&T cooperation in the post-Cold War era, and its relation to 
foreign policy goals, such as building democracy, promoting and 
maintaining peace, and furthering economic growth and sustainable 
development. Following the thematic chapters are narratives on science 
and technology cooperation with key countries.
    We face the challenge of seeking greater world stability at a 
critical time in our history. Finding effective solutions to global 
problems that impact Americans can be accomplished, in part, through 
interactions with scientists around the globe. We must continue to 
ensure that our country maintains world leadership in science and 
technology, and that international cooperation continues to advance our 
broad policy interests.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives; Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations; and Ted Stevens, chairman, Senate Committee on Governmental 
Affairs.
