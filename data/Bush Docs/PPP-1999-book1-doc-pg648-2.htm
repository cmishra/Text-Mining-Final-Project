To the Congress of the United States:
    I have today, pursuant to section 12304 of title 10, United States 
Code, authorized the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of 
Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard, when it is not operating 
as a service within the Department of the Navy, under their respective

members not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit, of the 
Selected Reserve, or any member in the Individual Ready Reserve

active components in support of operations in and around the former
