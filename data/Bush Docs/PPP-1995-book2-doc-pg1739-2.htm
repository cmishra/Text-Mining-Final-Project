Statement on the Balkan Peace Process
November 12, 1995

    Today's agreement between the Government of Croatia and the leaders 
of the local Serbian community on the region of Eastern Slavonia is a 
major step toward the achievement of an overall peace settlement in the 
Balkans. This agreement provides for the peaceful reintegration of the 
region under Croatian sovereignty, following a period of transitional 
administration by the United Nations.
    I congratulate the parties for the wisdom they have shown in 
entering into this agreement and avoiding renewed conflict. I also 
congratulate Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who played a direct 
role in assisting the parties to arrive at this agreement, along with 
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and the U.S. and U.N. mediators, Ambassador 
Peter Galbraith and Thorvald Stoltenberg.
