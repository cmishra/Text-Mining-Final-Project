Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Telephone 
Conversation With President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
June 28, 1993

    Beginning at about 1:15 p.m. this afternoon, President Clinton spoke 
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin for 30 minutes. The two leaders 
exchanged views on issues to be discussed at the G-7 summit in Tokyo. 
President Clinton described G-7 efforts to develop a program to support 
the process of democratic reform and development of free markets in 
Russia and said the U.S. expects the G-7 to move forward with a solid 
package of assistance.
    President Clinton also reviewed progress made in implementing the 
U.S. bilateral assistance package he announced in Vancouver, noting that 
the U.S. had already obligated more than half of the $1.6 billion. 
President Clinton said that the separate and additional $1.8 billion 
assistance package for Russia has been approved by the House of 
Representatives and was under consideration by the Senate. He reiterated 
to President Yeltsin his full support for this effort.
