Statement on the Death of Jacques Cousteau
June 25, 1997

    Hillary and I, along with tens of millions around the world, were 
saddened to learn of the death of a man with rare insight and 
extraordinary spirit, Jacques Cousteau. While we mourn his death, it is 
far more appropriate that we celebrate his remarkable life and the gifts 
he gave to all of us.
    Jacques Cousteau will be remembered for many things. He enabled 
mankind to truly become part of the sea and the creatures that live 
there, inventing scuba gear and creating the first one-person submarine. 
Most appropriately, he will be remembered for his service to us all on 
the good ship Calypso. Through his many documentaries, movies, and 
television specials, Captain Cousteau showed us both the importance of 
the world's oceans and the beauty that lies within. We are all far 
richer, and more caring, for his having shared his time on Earth with 
the human family.
    One of his most important documentaries was titled ``The World of 
Silence.'' Thanks to a life spent dedicated to serving all of God's 
creation, his legacy will be not silence. Rather, it will be continuing 
to inspire people the world over to love, appreciate, and respect the 
sea.
