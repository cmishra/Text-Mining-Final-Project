Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    As required by section 204(c) of the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and section 401(c) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), I transmit herewith the 
final report on the national emergency declared by Executive Order 12924 
of August 19, 1994, to deal with the threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States caused by the lapse of 
the Export Administration Act of 1979.
        Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The related Executive order of April 4 on termination of 
emergency authority for certain export controls is listed in Appendix D
