Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Iran
March 8, 2007

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the Iran emergency declared on March 15, 1995, is to continue in effect 
beyond March 15, 2007.
    The crisis between the United States and Iran constituted by the 
actions and policies of the Government of Iran that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on March 15, 1995, has not been 
resolved.The actions and policies of the Government of Iran are contrary 
to the interests of the United States in the region and pose a 
continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I 
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency 
declared with respect to Iran and maintain in force comprehensive 
sanctions against Iran to respond to this threat.

                                                          George W. Bush

The White House,

March 8, 2007.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
March 9. The related notice of March 8 is listed in Appendix D at the 
end of this volume.
