Statement on the Death of Jerry L. Falwell, Sr.<Falwell, Jerry L., 
Sr.<ls-thn-eq>
May 15, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of Jerry Falwell, a man who cherished faith, family, and freedom. As the 
founder of Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia, Jerry 
lived a life of faith and called upon men and women of all backgrounds 
to believe in God and serve their communities. One of his lasting 
contributions was the establishment of Lib-erty University, where he 
taught young people to remain true to their convictions and rely upon 
God's word throughout each stage of their lives.
    Today our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Macel<Falwell, 
Macel<ls-thn-eq> and the rest of the Falwell family.
