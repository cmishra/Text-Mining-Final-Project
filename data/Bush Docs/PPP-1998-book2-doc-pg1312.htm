Statement on House of Representatives Action on Environmental 
Legislation
July 23, 1998

    I am pleased that the House of Representatives, in a bipartisan 
fashion, today rejected an unwise and unwarranted attempt to deny the 
American people the facts about global warming.

    With much of the country suffering a stifling heat wave and with 
each month so far this year setting a new record for global temperature, 
the American people expect and deserve a fair, honest, and informed 
debate on the issue of climate change. Some in Congress would have 
stifled that debate by effectively imposing a gag order on Federal 
agencies. Thankfully, the House voted to remove this language from the 
VA-HUD appropriations bill.

    Unfortunately, the bill still contains other provisions that would 
restrict our ability to move forward with cost-effective steps to reduce 
the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. And appropriations bills 
moving through Congress would cut by nearly one half my proposed 
research and tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy 
technologies, measures that would reduce energy costs for American 
families while curbing greenhouse gases.

    Americans have demonstrated time and again that we can protect our 
environment while growing our economy. We can and must meet the 
challenge of climate change in the same way. I urge Congress to join us 
in this critical endeavor.
