Remarks on the Anniversary of September 11
September 11, 2003

    Today our Nation remembers--we remember a sad and terrible day, 
September the 11th, 2001. We remember lives lost. We remember the heroic 
deeds. We remember the compassion and the decency of our fellow citizens 
on that terrible day.
    Also, today is a day of prayer. We pray for the husbands and wives 
and moms and dads and sons and daughters and loved ones of those who 
still grieve and hurt. We pray for strength and wisdom. We thank God for 
the many blessings of this Nation, and we ask His blessings on those who 
especially hurt today.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:03 a.m. to journalists at St. John's 
Episcopal Church. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a 
Spanish language transcript of these remarks.
