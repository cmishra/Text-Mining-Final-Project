Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation To Authorize Permanent 
Trade Relations With Vietnam
December 9, 2006

    I commend the Congress for its bipartisan support for my request to 
approve legislation authorizing the grant of permanent normal trade 
relations to Vietnam. PNTR marks a significant step forward in the 
process of normalizing relations with Vietnam and will benefit both our 
nations. This designation will advance our trade and investment 
relations with Vietnam and ensure that the United States shares in the 
economic benefits generated by Vietnam's imminent membership in the 
World Trade Organization. Vietnam is demonstrating its strong commitment 
to continuing economic reforms, which will support political reform and 
respect for human rights. The American people welcome the remarkable 
transformation and economic progress in Vietnam, and we will continue to 
work together to strengthen our ties.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 6406.
