Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Likud Party Leader 
Binyamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem
March 14, 1996

    Q. Mr. President, if Mr. Netanyahu comes into power, will you 
cooperate with him as deeply as you cooperate with Prime Minister Peres?
    The President. I will certainly cooperate with him. Israel is a 
democracy. The Israeli voters will make their decision in a few weeks, 
and the United States relationship with Israel is deep, strong, and 
enduring. Of course I would.
    And I don't think there is much partisan difference in our country 
or yours on this question of fighting against terrorism. It's one of the 
great challenges the world faces. We've go to do a better job. We've got 
to strengthen it.

Note: The exchange began at 12:10 p.m. in the Presidential suite at the 
Laromme Hotel. A tape was not available for verification of the content 
of this exchange.
