Statement on House of Representatives Action on Tobacco Litigation 
Legislation
June 23, 2000

    I am pleased today that the House of Representatives voted 
decisively to support the interests of the American people over those of 
the special interests. This action will help support the Justice 
Department's litigation to recover billions of dollars in tobacco-
related health costs. I commend the bipartisan efforts led by 
Representatives Waxman,<Waxman, Henry A.<ls-thn-eq> Evans,<Evans, 
Lane<ls-thn-eq> Meehan,<Meehan, Martin T.<ls-thn-eq> Hansen,<Hansen, 
James V.<ls-thn-eq> Ganske,<Ganske, Greg<ls-thn-eq> and others who 
worked tirelessly to ensure that justice is carried out.
