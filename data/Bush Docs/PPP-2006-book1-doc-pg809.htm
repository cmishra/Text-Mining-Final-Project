Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Request for Additional Funds To Support Recovery Efforts in the Gulf 
Coast
April 25, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    To provide additional resources to assist the greater New Orleans 
region to continue its recovery from the devastation of Hurricane 
Katrina, I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for an 
additional $2.2 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), which 
is in addition to amounts requested on February 16th. This additional 
amount is offset by a $2.2 billion reduction in the amount requested on 
February 16th for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster 
Relief Fund.
    The revised Corps request, which now totals $3.7 billion, replaces 
the previous  supplemental request  for the Corps  that
was submitted on February 16th. This revised request supports the 
Administration's commitment to further enhance the levee system in parts 
of the New Orleans area to meet Federal 100-year standards of 
protection.
    I designate these proposals in the amounts requested herein as an 
emergency requirement.
    The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
