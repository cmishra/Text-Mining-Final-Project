Statement on the National Economy
March 7, 1997

    Today we learned that the economy is continuing to generate good 
jobs, almost 600,000 jobs in the first 2 months of this year alone. 
That's good news for American workers and their families. The American 
economy has now created nearly 12 million new jobs since I took office. 
Now it's time to keep this American job engine on the move by passing a 
balanced budget plan that invests in education and our future.
    Our 1993 economic plan has helped spur this strong job growth, while 
cutting the deficit by 63 percent, from $290 billion in 1992 to $107 
billion in 1996. Now we must cut the deficit to zero while investing in 
our people. My budget will do just that. I look forward to working with 
the Congress to get the job done by passing a balanced budget plan.
