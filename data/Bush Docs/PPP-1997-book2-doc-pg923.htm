Memorandum on the John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center
July 8, 1997

Memorandum for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs

Subject: John D. Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center

    A veteran of World War II, a local prosecutor, and since 1955, 
representing the people of Michigan in the Congress, John D. Dingell has 
served his country and his State with distinction for over 50 years. 
Furthermore, throughout his career Congressman Dingell has championed 
both quality health care and veterans' rights. I therefore take great 
pleasure in honoring Congressman Dingell by naming the VA Medical Center 
in Detroit after him.
    Thus, in recognition of Congressman Dingell's leadership and 
exemplary service to our country, I direct that the VA facility located 
at 4646 John R. in Detroit, Michigan, hereafter be known as the John D. 
Dingell Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. You are directed 
to take such further actions as necessary to effect the naming of this 
facility for Congressman Dingell.

                                                      William J. Clinton
