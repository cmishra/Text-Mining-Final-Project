    Mr. President and Madam,<Mesic, Milka<ls-thn-eq> thank you very 
much. Mr. Prime Minister,<Sanader, Ivo<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much. 
Also good to meet your wife.<Sanader, Mirjana<ls-thn-eq>
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are thrilled to be in your 
beautiful country, Mr. President. We appreciate your gracious 
hospitality, and we celebrate your invitation to become one of America's 
closest allies. I--you said you're from a small country. I'm impressed 
by the big hearts and the big basketball team. [Laughter]
    We are so proud of our relationship, Mr. President. We share common 
values. We believe in human rights and human dignity. We believe there's 
a Creator that has given every man, woman, and child on the face of the 
Earth the great gift of freedom. We believe markets are capable of 
unleashing the entrepreneurial spirit of our peoples. We understand that 
freedom requires sacrifice.
    I salute the people of your country for your courage and willingness 
to help a young democracy in Afghanistan not only thrive but succeed. I 
appreciate the friends who have stared evil in the face and understand 
there's a better tomorrow.
    And so, Mr. President, I bring the greetings of my country to your 
beautiful land. With the honor due to a trusted ally, I offer a toast to 
you and to the valiant people of Croatia.

Note: The President spoke at 8:04 p.m. at the Pucka Dvorana. In his 
remarks, he referred to Milka Mesic, wife of President Mesic; and Prime
