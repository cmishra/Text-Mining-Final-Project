Statement on Senate Inaction on the Nomination for Assistant Attorney 
General, Civil Rights Division
July 21, 1999

    I strongly support the efforts of the National Council of Asian 
Pacific Americans to call attention to the failure of the Senate to 
confirm Bill Lann Lee<Lee, Bill Lann> as Assistant Attorney 
General for Civil Rights.
    I resubmitted Mr. Lee's<Lee, Bill Lann> nomination to the 
Senate more than 4 months ago, yet the Senate Judiciary Committee has 
not considered his nomination. Bill Lee has an excellent record as 
Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. Under 
his leadership, the Justice Department has enforced our civil rights 
laws justly and fairly. The Department is combating hate crimes, 
ensuring fair housing, fighting illegal discrimination against persons 
with disabilities, protecting workers from exploitation, and taking 
other strong actions to protect people's rights.
    Some of Mr. Lee's<Lee, Bill Lann> opponents have decided 
to use his nomination as a means of expressing their disagreement with 
the civil rights laws themselves. This is wrong. He deserves to be 
considered based on his record and abilities, not blocked because some 
Senators disagree with the law of the land. To refuse to allow the 
Senate to vote on his nomination does a disservice to the confirmation 
process, to this outstanding nominee, and to the American people.
