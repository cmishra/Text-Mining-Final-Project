Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Amendments
January 7, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for Fiscal Year 
2003 budget amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Health and 
Human Services, the Interior, Labor, and the Treasury; the Corps of 
Engineers; as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and 
the Federal Trade Commission.
    The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
