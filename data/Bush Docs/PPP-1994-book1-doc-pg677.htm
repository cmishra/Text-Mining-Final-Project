    The President today announced his intention to nominate Dr. Anne C.

to our experienced team of science and technology leaders,'' the 
President said. ``Anne Petersen has impeccable scientific standing as a 
social scientist with strong research capabilities in mathematics and 
statistics. She also is an outstanding administrator with a significant

University of Minnesota.''
