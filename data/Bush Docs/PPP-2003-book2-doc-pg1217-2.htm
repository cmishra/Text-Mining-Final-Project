Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Providing Funds 
for the Department of Homeland Security's Counterterrorism Fund
September 30, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    In accordance with provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act, 2001 (Public Law 106-554), and the Consolidated Appropriations 
Resolution, 2003 (Public Law 108-7), I hereby request and make available 
$38,100,000 for the Department of Homeland Security's Counterterrorism 
Fund. Of these funds, I hereby designate $28,748,918 as an emergency 
requirement pursuant to Public Law 106-554.
    These funds would allow the Department of Homeland Security to 
continue to improve the security at our Nation's ports by deploying 
radiation monitoring devices nationwide and strengthening the system 
that is used to identify potential threats posed by international cargo 
shipments and international passengers.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
