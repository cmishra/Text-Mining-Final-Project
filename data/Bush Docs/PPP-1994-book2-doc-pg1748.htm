Statement on the Arts and Humanities Awards Recipients
October 13, 1994

    These extraordinary and talented individuals have borne eloquent 
testimony to the enduring power of the arts and the humanities in our 
everyday lives. They have contributed profoundly to the richness and 
variety of our Nation's cultural life, and so it is with enormous 
gratitude that we pay them national tribute.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the awards ceremony for the National Medal of the Arts and the Charles 
Frankel Prize scheduled for October 14. Biographies of the honorees were 
made available by the Office of the Press Secretary.
