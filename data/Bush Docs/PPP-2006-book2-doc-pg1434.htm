Statement on Senate Passage of Child Protection and Safety Legislation
July 21, 2006

    I applaud Members of the United States Senate for voting to 
strengthen our laws against convicted sex offenders.
    The ``Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006'' will 
ensure appropriate sentencing for sex offenders and will provide local 
law enforcement officials with thetools they need to track those who 
prey upon children. By supporting this legislation, the Senate has taken 
an important step towards providing our country with a strict, uniform 
system for monitoring sex offenders to ensure that they do not commit 
additional crimes against our Nation's children.
    I urge the House of Representatives to pass this good legislation as 
quickly as possible, so that I can sign it into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 4472.
