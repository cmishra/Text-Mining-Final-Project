Statement on the Nomination of Strobe Talbott To Be Deputy Secretary of 
State
December 28, 1993

    I am delighted by the decision of Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher to nominate Ambassador Strobe Talbott to become Deputy 
Secretary of State. I have known and respected Ambassador Talbott for 
over 25 years and have always found him to be a man of great ability, 
intellect, and vision. He has performed superbly in his current role as 
Ambassador at Large for the former Soviet Republics, and I have full 
confidence in his ability to perform equally well in this new capacity 
at the Department of State.
