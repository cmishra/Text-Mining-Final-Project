Message on the Observance of Easter 2003
April 17, 2003

    I send greetings to those observing Easter. Easter is the most 
important event of the Christian faith, when people around the world 
join together with family and friends to celebrate the Resurrection of 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the hope of life to come.
    For Christians, the life and death of Jesus are the ultimate 
expressions of love, and the supreme demonstrations of God's mercy, 
faithfulness, and redemption. Since Christ's miraculous Resurrection on 
Easter, more than 2,000 years ago, Christians have expressed joy and 
gratitude for this wondrous sacrifice and for God's promise of freedom 
for the oppressed, healing for the brokenhearted, and salvation.
    Though this year's observance comes at a time when our world faces 
many challenges, the message of Easter remains unchanged--though sorrow 
may last through the night, joy comes in the morning. This holiday 
comforts us, as we remember that suffering will pass and goodness will 
prevail.
    This Easter season, join me in praying for peace, wisdom, and 
resolve. During this holy time, may Christ's example of love and 
sacrifice compel us towards justice and compassion, and renew us with an 
assurance of hope and everlasting joy.

    Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a Happy Easter.

                                                          George W. Bush
