Statement on the Approval of Robert B. Zoellick<Zoellick, Robert 
B.<ls-thn-eq> as President of the World Bank
June 25, 2007

    I welcome the action by the Executive Board of the World Bank to 
unanimously approve Robert Zoellick as President of the World Bank. Bob 
Zoellick is a dynamic leader who is deeply committed to the mission of 
the World Bank in helping struggling nations to defeat poverty, grow 
their economies, strengthen transparency and accountability in 
governance, and offer their people the prospect of a better life. The 
United States looks forward to continuing our close partnership with the 
World Bank to achieve these shared goals.
