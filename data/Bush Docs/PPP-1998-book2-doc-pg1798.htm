the Coasts of the United States, with annex, as extended (``the 1992 
Agreement''). The present Agreement, which was effected by an exchange 
of notes in Tallinn on March 10 and June 11, 1998, extends the 1992 
Agreement to June 30, 2000.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Estonia, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.

The White House,
