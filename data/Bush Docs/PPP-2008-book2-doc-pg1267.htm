Statement on Senate Confirmation of James Jeffrey<Jeffrey, James 
F.<ls-thn-eq> as United States Ambassador to Turkey
October 2, 2008

    I am pleased that the Senate confirmed Jim Jeffrey to be the United 
States Ambassador to Turkey. Jim is a man of intellect, integrity, and 
commitment. His work as my Deputy National Security Adviser, as United 
States Ambassador to Albania, and in three previous assignments to 
Turkey make him superbly qualified to represent the United States to our 
friend and NATO ally.
    I thank Jim for his continued service to our Nation and congratulate 
him and his family on today's confirmation.
