Message on the Observance of Eid al-Adha
December 21, 2005

    I send greetings to Muslims around the world as you celebrate Eid 
al-Adha.
    When God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son, Abraham placed his 
faith in God above all else. During Eid al-Adha, Muslims celebrate 
Abraham's devotion and give thanks for God's mercy and many blessings. 
Eid is also a time for demonstrating charity and reaching out to family, 
friends, and those in need.
    America is blessed to have people of many religious beliefs who 
contribute to the diverse makeup of this country. Through generosity, 
compassion, and a commitment to faith, Muslim Americans have helped make 
our country stronger.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a joyous 
celebration. Eid Mubarak.

                                                          George W. Bush
