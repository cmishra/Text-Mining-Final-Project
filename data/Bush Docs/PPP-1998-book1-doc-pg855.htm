Statement on Further Nuclear Testing by Pakistan
May 30, 1998

    The United States condemns today's second round of nuclear tests by 
Pakistan. These tests can only serve to increase tensions in an already 
volatile region. With their recent tests, Pakistan and India are 
contributing to a self-defeating cycle of escalation that does not add 
to the security of either country. Both India and Pakistan need to 
renounce further nuclear and missile testing immediately and take 
decisive steps to reverse this dangerous arms race.
    I will continue to work with leaders throughout the international 
community to reduce tensions in south Asia, to preserve the global 
consensus on nonproliferation.
    I call on India and Pakistan to resume their direct dialog, to sign 
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty immediately and without conditions to 
reverse the arms race there, and to join the clear international 
consensus in support of nonproliferation.
