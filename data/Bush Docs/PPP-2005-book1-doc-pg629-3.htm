Message on the Observance of Passover, 5765
April 19, 2005

    I send greetings to those observing Passover, beginning at sundown 
on April 23.
    This celebration marks the historic exodus of the Israelites from 
Pharaoh's oppression more than 3,000 years ago. During Passover, Jews 
around the world gather with family and friends to share the story of 
God's deliverance of the Israelites from slavery to freedom. Through 
songs and prayers, they remember the blessings and mercy of a just and 
loving God. By passing this story from generation to generation, they 
teach the triumph of faith over tyranny and celebrate God's promise of 
freedom.
    The lesson of this story is timeless and reminds us that even in the 
face of struggle, hope endures. As we work to bring hope to the 
oppressed, we recall the words of the Psalmist, which are read at the 
Seder meal: ``This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be 
glad in it.''
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a joyous 
Passover.

                                                          George W. Bush
