Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance 
Program
December 15, 1995

Dear Mr. Leader:
    I am increasingly concerned that, under the current continuing 
resolution, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program (LIHEAP) is 
not meeting the needs of families requiring heating assistance.
    With the onset of winter, low-income families need more help to keep 
their homes warm. Each year, LIHEAP assistance goes to about six million 
needy households, many of which have an elderly or disabled member or 
young children.
    Normally, by this time of year, States' energy assistance programs 
would be adequately funded to help households tackle high energy bills 
and insulate drafty homes. This year, however, Congress still has not 
passed a full-year appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education, and Related Agencies--the bill which funds LIHEAP. 
The House voted to end LIHEAP altogether.
    Under the two continuing resolutions that have been enacted this 
fall, LIHEAP has been funded at only $232 million. Last year, over three 
times that amount was available to States between September and the end 
of December.
    I strongly urge Congress to pass a full-year appropriation as soon 
as possible that includes funding for LIHEAP. At a minimum, Congress 
must enable the Administration to make available a seasonally 
appropriate share of the previously appropriated funds for LIHEAP.
    Congress should act quickly. Since winter is almost upon us, a 
rising number of low-income Americans, particularly those living in 
colder regions, will continue to need more help to keep warm at home.
        Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives; Robert Dole, Senate majority leader; Richard 
Gephardt, House Democratic leader; and Thomas Daschle, Senate Democratic 
leader.
