Remarks on Departure From Waco, Texas

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I want to wish everybody a happy 
Mother's Day. It's just a special day for--to give thanks to our moms, 
to appreciate the hard work that moms do. And I understand that for 
some, however, Mother's Day is a sad day for those who lost their lives 
in Oklahoma and Missouri and Georgia because of the tornadoes--are 
wondering whether or not tomorrow will be a bright and hopeful day.
    We send our prayers to those who lost their lives, the families of 
those who lost their lives. And the Federal Government will be moving 
hard to help. I'll be in touch with the<Henry, Bradford C.<ls-thn-eq> 
Governors<Blunt, Matthew R.<ls-thn-eq> to<Perdue, George E. 
``Sonny''<ls-thn-eq> offer all the Federal assistance we can.
    This Mother's Day weekend was awfully special for Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and me. Our little girl Jenna<Bush, Jenna 
Hager<ls-thn-eq> married a really good guy, Henry Hager.<Hager, 
Henry<ls-thn-eq> The wedding was spectacular. It's just--it's all we 
could have hoped for. The weather was--cooperated nicely, and just as 
the vows were exchanged, the sun set over our lake. And it was just a 
special day and a wonderful day, and we're mighty blessed.
    Anyway, thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 11:52 a.m. at Texas State Technical 
College. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. C. Bradford Henry of
