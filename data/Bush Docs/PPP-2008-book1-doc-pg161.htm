Statement on Senate Action on Economic Growth Legislation
February 7, 2008

    Two weeks ago, my administration reached an agreement with Speaker 
Pelosi<Pelosi, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> and Leader Boehner<Boehner, John 
A.<ls-thn-eq> on a short-term economic growth package that would quickly 
put money into the hands of the American people and provide our economy 
the boost it needs. Today the Senate amended that bill in ways I can 
support.
    This plan is robust, broad-based, timely, and it will be effective. 
This bill will help to stimulate consumer spending and accelerate needed 
business investment.
    This economic growth package is an example of bipartisan cooperation 
at a time when the American people most expect it. I thank members of 
both parties and both Houses for their efforts to advance this important 
legislation.
