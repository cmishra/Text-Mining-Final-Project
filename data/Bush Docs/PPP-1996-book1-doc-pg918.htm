Remarks Following the Entertainment at the State Dinner Honoring 
President Mary Robinson of Ireland
June 13, 1996

    Weren't they wonderful tonight? They made us all so happy. 
[Applause]
    I also want to say to President Robinson that she brought America a 
little of the luck of the Irish. I am pleased to announce to you that 
while we were here at dinner the long standoff with the freemen in 
Montana ended peacefully tonight. I want to thank the FBI and the local 
law enforcement officials and say I am very, very proud of them. I know 
I speak for all of our people, when we say we'll all say a little prayer 
tonight of gratitude for this peaceful resolution of a difficult 
situation.
    Finally, you heard President Robinson say this is an Irish event and 
it can't end early, so after we break up, the Air Force Airmen of Note 
will be playing here. We urge you to stay and dance to your heart's 
content or till the angry neighbors run us off. [Laughter] My experience 
is that will be quite some time. You can make it until dawn. [Laughter]
    Again, I thank you, Mary Chapin Carpenter; thank you, Mary Black; 
thank you, gentlemen. It was a wonderful, wonderful evening. And most of 
all, thank you, President Robinson. Thank you, Nick. It's been wonderful 
for Hillary and me to have you here. Bless you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:15 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to singers Mary Chapin Carpenter and 
Mary Black; and Nick Robinson, husband of President Robinson.
