Statement on the Kennedy-Murray Amendments to Proposed Education 
Flexibility Partnership Legislation
March 5, 1999

    I strongly support the efforts of Senators Murray<Murray, 
Patty> and Kennedy<Kennedy, Edward M.> to offer a 
class size amendment to the ed-flex bill. We must make a long-term 
commitment now to hire 100,000 new, well-prepared teachers to reduce 
class size in the early grades. The Republican leadership is wrong to 
try to shut down debate on this bill before a class size amendment can 
be voted on. I urge them to allow an up-or-down vote on this amendment, 
and I urge every Senator to vote for it.
