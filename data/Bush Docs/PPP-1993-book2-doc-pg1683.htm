Statement on Rebuilding the Cypress Freeway in California
October 4, 1993

    Most Americans will never forget the picture of the Cypress Freeway 
collapsed upon itself after the Loma Prieta earthquake. As repairs 
continue, I want the people of California to know that we will be there 
to get the job done. Communities around our Nation have always been able 
to count on the Federal Government to assume the cost of repairing 
Federal-aid highways hit by natural disasters. That is a commitment that 
we are helping to fulfill today.

Note: The President's statement was included in a White House statement 
announcing the President's request to Congress for funds to rebuild the 
freeway.
