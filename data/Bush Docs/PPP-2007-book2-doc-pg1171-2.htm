Statement on Senate Confirmation of James A. Nussle<Nussle, James 
A.<ls-thn-eq> as Director of the Office of Management and Budget
September 5, 2007

    I thank the Senate for its strong bipartisan vote confirming Jim 
Nussle as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

[[Page 1172]]

    Jim's confirmation comes at a critical time for our Nation's budget 
as Congress considers this year's annual spending bills. With less than 
a month until the new fiscal year begins, Congress has not sent any of 
the 12 appropriations bills to my desk. We must work together quickly to 
get the people's work done on time.
    Jim is a strong advocate for fiscal discipline and progrowth 
economic policies, and he will help lead efforts to balance the budget 
by 2012 by restraining Federal spending and keeping taxes low. And as 
OMB Director, he will work to provide transparency regarding Federal 
spending and earmarks, strong accountability in Government, and better 
results for taxpayers.
    I congratulate Jim and his family on today's confirmation and thank 
him for his continued service to our Nation.
