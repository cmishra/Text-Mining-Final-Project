Statement on the Republican Budget Proposal
April 7, 2000

    This new Republican budget combines bad fiscal policy and a flawed 
economic strategy. It undermines our efforts to strengthen Social 
Security and Medicare, makes it harder to pay off the debt, and rests on 
dramatic cuts in education, law enforcement, the environment, and 
efforts to promote peace in national security.
    I remain committed to working with any Member of Congress from 
either party on a budget that will strengthen Social Security and 
Medicare, add a prescription drug benefit, eliminate the debt by 2013, 
expand access to health coverage through Medicaid and the Children's 
Health Insurance Program, and strengthen education and other key 
investments. Let's put this empty political document aside and work 
together to keep America on a responsible fiscal course that meets our 
Nation's long-term challenges.
