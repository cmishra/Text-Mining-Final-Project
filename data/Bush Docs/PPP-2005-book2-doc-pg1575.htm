Remarks to Reporters in Simi Valley
October 21, 2005

Mehlis Report

    Today the United Nations issued what is called the Mehlis 
Report<Mehlis, Detlev<ls-thn-eq>. It's a report into the death of Prime 
Minister Hariri of Lebanon, and the report is deeply disturbing. The 
report suggests that it is--strongly suggests that the politically 
motivated assassination could not have taken place without Syrian 
involvement.
    I called Secretary Rice<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> this morning 
and instructed her to call upon the United Nations to convene a session 
as quickly as possible to deal with this very serious matter. We have 
made it clear that the position of the United States is that there be no 
foreign involvement in Lebanon. The United Nations made that clear 
through Resolution 1559. And today a serious report came out that 
requires the world to look at it very carefully and respond accordingly.
    Thank you all very much.

Note: The President spoke at 11:50 a.m. at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library. In his remarks, he referred to Detlev Mehlis, 
head, United Nations International Independent Investigation Commission 
into the assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of these remarks.
