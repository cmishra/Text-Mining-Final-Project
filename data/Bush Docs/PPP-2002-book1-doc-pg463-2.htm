Statement on Proposed Housing Affordability Legislation
March 20, 2002

    I commend Chairman Oxley,<Oxley, Michael G.> Housing 
Subcommittee Chairwoman Roukema,<Roukema, Marge> and 
Congressman Green<Green, Mark> for introducing H.R. 3995, the 
``Housing Affordability for America Act of 2002,'' and look forward to 
working with them on the bill in the legislative process. Increasing 
housing opportunities for all Americans is a high priority for my 
administration. In particular, I am committed to increasing the 
opportunities for minority families to become homeowners.
    The purchase of a home is a unique commitment that benefits the 
homeowner and the community and ultimately the Nation. My budget 
contains proposals designed to increase homeownership and affordable 
housing opportunities. Through their hard work on the ``Housing 
Affordability for America Act of 2002,'' Chairman Oxley,<Oxley, Michael 
G.> Chairwoman Roukema,<Roukema, Marge> and 
Congressman Green<Green, Mark> have joined in this worthy 
effort.
