Statement on the Selection of the New NATO Secretary General
August 4, 1999

    I am very pleased that our NATO Alliance has selected British 
Defense Secretary George Robertson<Robertson, George> to be 
NATO's next Secretary General.
    George Robertson<Robertson, George> is an extremely 
talented and dedicated public servant. He has made a tremendous 
contribution to the United Kingdom's effort to modernize its military 
forces. He displayed extraordinary leadership during the Kosovo conflict 
and has continued to lead in the effort to restore stability there. I 
look forward to working with him as he guides NATO into the new century.
    Secretary General Solana<Solana, Javier> has done a superb 
job, steering NATO through conflict in the Balkans, ushering in three 
new members of the Alliance, reaching out to our security partners 
across Europe, and meeting other vital challenges. I look forward to 
continuing to work with him in his new role at the European Union.
