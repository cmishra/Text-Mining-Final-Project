Remarks Following a Church Service in Hanoi
November 19, 2006

     Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I just had a moment to converse 
with God in a church here in Hanoi. We were touched by the simplicity 
and the beauty of the moment. We appreciate very much the congregation 
for allowing us to come and worship with them.
     A whole society is a society which welcomes basic freedoms, and 
there's no more basic freedom than the basic--the freedom to worship as 
you see fit. And Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I were proud to 
worship with believers

here in Hanoi. And we, again, thank the church for the opportunity to 
come by. My hope is that people all across the world will be able to 
express religion [religious]* freedom. And it's our way of expressing 
our personal faith and, at the same time, urging societies to feel 
comfortable with and confident in saying to their people, if you feel 
like praising God, you're allowed to do so in any way you see fit.
