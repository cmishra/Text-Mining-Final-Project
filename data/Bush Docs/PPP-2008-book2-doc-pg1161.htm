Letter to Congressional Leaders Certifying Exports to the People's 
Republic of China
August 28, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom 
Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public 
Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export to the People's Republic 
of China of one two-inch fluid energy mill for the research and 
development of pharmaceutical powders and ten accelerometers for 
incorporation into railway geometry measurement systems is not 
detrimental to the United States space launch industry, and that the 
material and equipment, including any indirect technical benefit that 
could be derived from such exports, will not measurably improve the 
missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate.
