Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Normal Trade 
Relations Status for China
June 2, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    I hereby transmit a report including my reasons for determining that 
continuation of the waiver currently in effect for the People's Republic 
of China under subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended, (the ``Act'') will substantially promote the objectives of 
section 402 of the Act.
         Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

 Note:  Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
The related memorandum of June 2 is listed in Appendix D at the end of 
this volume.
