Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the National Science 
Foundation
September 21, 1993

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 3(f) of the National Science Foundation 
Act of 1950, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1862(f)), I am pleased to send you 
the annual report of the National Science Foundation for Fiscal Year 
1992. This report describes research supported by the Foundation in the 
mathematical, physical, biological, social, behavioral, and computer 
sciences; engineering; and education in those fields.
    Achievements such as the ones described in this report are the basis 
for much of our Nation's strength--its economic growth, national 
security, and the overall well-being of our people.

    As we move toward the 21st century, the Foundation will continue its 
efforts to expand our Nation's research achievements, our productivity, 
and our ability to remain competitive in world markets.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
September 21, 1993.
