Message to the Congress Transmitting the Tax Relief Plan
February 8, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:
    Enclosed please find my plan to provide needed tax relief to the 
American people. Over the last several months, the economy has slowed 
dramatically. I believe that the best way to ensure that our prosperity 
continues is to put more money in the hands of consumers and 
entrepreneurs as soon as possible. I look forward to working with the 
Congress to enact meaningful tax cuts into law.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 February 8, 2001.
