Statement on Zero Tolerance for Prescription Drug Internet Sites That 
Harm Patient Safety and Health
December 28, 1999

    Prescription drug sites on the Internet have given consumers new 
options to obtain needed medications, sometimes at a more affordable 
price. This industry is in its infancy, however, and rogue operators 
pose a threat to the health of Americans. Today we are unveiling a 
proposal that sends a signal that we have zero tolerance for 
prescription drug Internet sites that ignore Federal and State laws and 
harm patient safety and health. Dispensing medications through the 
Internet without prescriptions or licenses must stop.
