Message on the 40th Anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ``I 
Have a Dream'' Speech
August 28, 2003

    I send greetings to those gathered to celebrate the 40th anniversary 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s historic ``I Have a Dream'' speech.
    Through his leadership, courage, and determination, Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. brought tremendous good to our country. His vision and 
words caused Americans to examine their hearts and live up to the ideals 
of our Constitution.
    In his speech 40 years ago, Dr. King expressed his dream that people 
would be judged by the content of their character and not by the color 
of their skin. He viewed the summer of 1963 as a time for 
America to renew its commitment to equality. Today, we have come a long 
way, but there is still work to do to realize Dr. King's dream. As we 
honor this important anniversary, I encourage all Americans to continue 
the march to equality and opportunity for all.

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a memorable celebration.

                                                          George W. Bush
