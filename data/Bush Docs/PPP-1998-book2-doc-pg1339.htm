Statement on the Death of David J. McCloud
July 26, 1998

    Hillary and I were greatly saddened to learn of the death in a plane 
crash of Lieutenant General David J. McCloud, Commander, Alaskan 
Command. He hosted us several weeks ago at Elmendorf Air Force Base on 
our way to China and proudly described for us the mission his command 
carries out in furtherance of our national security interests. General 
McCloud was a superb airman and an exemplary leader. He helped ensure 
that our forces from all of the military services were prepared to meet 
the challenges of the post-cold-war environment. His impact was felt 
throughout the United States Air Force and the Department of Defense. On 
behalf of all Americans, we extend our condolences to his family and the 
men and women of the Alaskan Command that he led so well.
