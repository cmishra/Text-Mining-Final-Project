Statement on Senate Confirmation of General David D. 
McKiernan<McKiernan, David D.<ls-thn-eq> as Commander of United States 
Armed Forces in Afghanistan
October 2, 2008

    Today the Senate confirmed General David D. McKiernan as commander 
of U.S. Forces, Afghanistan. This newly created position and realignment 
of the command structure provides General McKiernan authority over 
nearly all U.S. forces in Afghanistan, ensuring greater coordination in 
operational planning and execution. General McKiernan will continue to 
serve as commander of the International Security Assistance Force.
    General McKiernan's new responsibilities will strengthen both U.S. 
and NATO efforts in Afghanistan. I congratulate General McKiernan on his 
confirmation and commend the Senate for its quick action on this 
important nomination.
