Message to the Senate Transmitting the Republic of Georgia-United States 
Investment Treaty
July 10, 1995

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of 
the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of 
Georgia Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of 
Investment, with Annex, signed at Washington on March 7, 1994. I 
transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the 
Department of State with respect to this Treaty.
    The bilateral investment Treaty (BIT) with Georgia was the eighth 
such treaty between the United States and a newly independent state of 
the former Soviet Union. The Treaty is designed to protect U.S. 
investment and assist the Republic of Georgia in its efforts to develop 
its economy by creating conditions more favorable for U.S. private 
investment and thus strengthen the development of its private sector.
    The Treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy toward international 
and domestic investment. A specific tenet of U.S. policy, reflected in 
this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign investment in 
the United States should receive national treatment. Under this Treaty, 
the Parties also agree to international law standards for expropriation 
and compensation for expropriation; free transfer of funds related to 
investments; freedom of investments from performance requirements; fair, 
equitable, and most-favored-nation treatment; and the investor of 
investment's freedom to choose to resolve disputes with the host 
government through international arbitration.
    I recommend that the Senate consider this Treaty as soon as 
possible, and give its advice and consent to ratification of the Treaty, 
with Annex, at an early date.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 10, 1995.
