Statement on House of Representatives Action on National Energy Policy 
Legislation
July 17, 2001

    Today's actions in the House Resources Committee and in the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee represent important steps toward 
implementing a comprehensive and balanced energy policy. I am pleased 
that the committees are acting swiftly to increase energy efficiency, 
expand use of renewables, and open a small portion of the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge for environmentally responsible exploration.
    For too long America has lacked a comprehensive national energy 
policy. My administration has proposed a plan that will reduce America's 
reliance on foreign oil through increased conservation and efficiency, 
improved infrastructure, and increased exploration. I commend the House 
committees for moving forward on these goals.
