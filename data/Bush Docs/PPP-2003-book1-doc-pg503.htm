Statement on the Terrorist Bombings in Casablanca, Morocco
May 17, 2003

    I strongly condemn the terrorist bombings in Casablanca, Morocco, 
that have taken many innocent lives. On behalf of the American people, I 
extend condolences to the families of the victims and our hopes for a 
quick recovery to those injured.
    These acts of murder show, once again, that terrorism respects no 
boundaries nor borders. Casablanca is a city well-known for its 
tolerance and its diverse range of religious and ethnic communities.
    These acts demonstrate that the war against terror goes on. Morocco 
is a close friend of the United States, and we offer assistance to the 
Government of Morocco to help track down and bring to justice those 
responsible.
