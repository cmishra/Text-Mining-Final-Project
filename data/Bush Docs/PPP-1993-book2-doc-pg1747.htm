Statement on Action by the House of Representatives on Education Reform 
Legislation
October 14, 1993

    I am pleased by last night's overwhelming vote in the House of 
Representatives in favor of my Goals 2000 education reform bill. This 
bill takes an important step towards codifying into law the national 
education goals.
    Goals 2000 invites every State to participate in true systemic 
reform and will serve as the cornerstone of my administration's efforts 
to create a world-class system of education and training with high 
expectations and opportunities for every child.
    I want to thank Chairmen Bill Ford and Dale Kildee and other 
Democratic members of the Education and Labor committee, whose 
experienced leadership and cooperation across party lines were crucial 
to attaining this important victory.
    I am especially gratified by the broad bipartisan support that Goals 
2000 enjoys. I want to thank the many distinguished Republicans, 
starting with Representatives Bill Goodling and Steve Gunderson, who 
worked hard over many months to improve this bill and who spoke out so 
forcefully on its behalf yesterday. And I congratulate Secretary of 
Education Riley and Secretary of Labor Reich, whose unswerving 
commitment and effective advocacy were essential.
    The enactment of my comprehensive education and training agenda is 
crucial to achieving an economy that can compete effectively in world 
markets and create high-skill, high-wage jobs for all Americans. I urge 
the Senate to bring this legislation to the floor as quickly as possible 
and approve it with bipartisan support.
    It will be a great day for the children of America and for all 
Americans when I am able to sign Goals 2000 into law.
