Statement on the Death of President Boris Trajkovski<Trajkovski, 
Boris<ls-thn-eq> of Macedonia
February 27, 2004

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of President Boris Trajkovski 
of Macedonia, a distinguished leader and a great friend of the United 
States. On behalf of the American people, I extend condolences to 
President Trajkovski's family and to the people of Macedonia.
    President Trajkovski showed extraordinary courage in leading his 
country from the brink of civil conflict to peace by signing the Ohrid 
Framework Agreement. The United States strongly supports President 
Trajkovski's vision of a multi-ethnic, democratic Macedonia at peace 
with itself and its neighbors and on the path to full membership in the 
transatlantic community.
