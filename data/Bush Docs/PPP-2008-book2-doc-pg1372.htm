Remarks on Arrival at the National Building Museum
November 15, 2008

Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy

    Good morning. We had a good dinner last night. I am pleased with the 
progress we're making on--to, one, address the current crisis. I am 
pleased that we're discussing a way forward to make sure that such a 
crisis is unlikely to occur again. And I am pleased that the leaders 
reaffirmed the principles behind open markets and free trade. One of the 
dangers during a crisis such as this is that people will start 
implementing protectionist policies.
    Obviously, you know, this crisis has not ended. There's some 
progress being made, but there's still a lot of more work to be done. 
And so we had a good, frank discussion last night. I look forward to the 
discussions today. And we'll see you after the meetings have ended.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 7:53 a.m.
