Statement on the Inauguration of the Transitional Government in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo
July 18, 2003

    I congratulate President Joseph Kabila<Kabila, Joseph<ls-thn-eq> and 
the Congolese people on the installation of the new transitional 
Government in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I also extend 
congratulations to Vice Presidents Jean-Pierre Bemba,<Bemba, John-
Pierre<ls-thn-eq> Abdoulaye Yerodia,<Yerodia, Abdoulaye<ls-thn-eq> 
Azarias Ruberwa,<Ruberwa, Azarias<ls-thn-eq> and Z'Ahidi Ngoma.<Zahidi 
Ngoma, Arthur<ls-thn-eq> The arrival of former rebel leaders in Kinshasa 
and their participation with former opposition parties in the new 
Government is a major achievement that sets the country on a course 
toward peace and democratic elections. I am confident that the Congolese 
people will be well served by the experience and vision these five 
leaders bring to these important posts.
    The United States will work closely with President Kabila<Kabila, 
Joseph<ls-thn-eq> and the transitional Government to promote peace, 
prosperity, and democracy for all Congolese. I call upon neighboring 
countries to join us in supporting Congo's new Government during this 
crucial time.
