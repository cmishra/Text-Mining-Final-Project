Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the Emigration 
Policies and Trade Status of Mongolia
July 1, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    On September 4, 1996, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Mongolia was ``not in violation of '' the freedom of emigration criteria 
of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This action allowed 
for the continuation of most-favored-nation status for Mongolia and 
certain other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to Congress 
concerning the emigration laws and policies of Mongolia. You will find 
that the report indicates continued Mongolian compliance with U.S. and 
international standards in the area of emigration.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on July 2.
