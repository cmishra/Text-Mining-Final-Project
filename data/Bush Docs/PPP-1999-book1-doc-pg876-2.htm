Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
June 3, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period February 1, 1999, to March 31, 1999. 
The previous submission covered events during December 1998 and January 
1999.
    The United States remains actively engaged in efforts to promote a 
negotiated settlement to the Cyprus dispute, under U.N. auspices and on 
the basis of a bizonal, bicommunal, federal solution. Secretary Albright 
underscored the U.S. commitment to finding a comprehensive solution to 
Cypriot Foreign Minister Kassoulides<Kassoulides, Ioannis> 
during their February 17 meeting in Washington.
    Our efforts also continued in the region. Special Cyprus 
Coordinator<Miller, Thomas J.> Thomas J. Miller traveled to 
Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece during March 8-13, and Ambassador 
Brill<Brill, Kenneth C.> continued discussions with the Greek 
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leadership on next steps. Ambassador Miller 
also discussed prospects for progress with counterparts in European 
Union capitals and in Moscow.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
