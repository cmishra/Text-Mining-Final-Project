Statement on Senate Action To Block a Vote on the Nomination of Bill 
Myers<Myers, William G.<ls-thn-eq> To Be a United States Circuit Judge
July 20, 2004

    Today a minority of Senators once again used obstructionist 
filibuster tactics to block a vote on an outstanding nominee to the 
United States Court of Appeals. Bill Myers has had a distinguished 
career as a public servant and practicing attorney and enjoys widespread 
support from across the political spectrum, yet he has been denied a 
simple up-or-down vote.
    These tactics are unfair to Bill Myers and unfair to the American 
people. Bill Myers has the support of a bipartisan majority of Senators 
and would be confirmed if given an up-or-down vote. He would be an asset 
to the Ninth Circuit, which is seriously overworked and in need of more 
judges. He would fill a seat that has been designated a judicial 
emergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States. More 
Americans will be denied speedy access to our justice system by the 
obstruction of a few.
    I continue to call on the minority in the Senate to stop playing 
politics with the American judicial system and give judicial nominees 
the fair treatment they deserve and the American people expect.
