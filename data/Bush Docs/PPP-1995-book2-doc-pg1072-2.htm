Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With the Congressional Black 
Caucus
July 11, 1995

Affirmative Action

    Q. Mr. President, are you prepared to deliver your affirmative 
action review next Wednesday, as has been speculated?
    The President. What date is that?
    Q. The 19th. [Laughter]
    The President. I believe that's the day we're going to do it.
    Q. Have you already reached a conclusion? Are you going to brief 
these Members today

[[Page 1073]]

on what your thoughts are dealing with affirmative action?
    The President. I'm going to deal with their agenda today. I'm here 
and I'm listening to them and they're going to go through an agenda and 
I'm going to respond to it.

President Boris Yeltsin of Russia

    Q. Any further word on Boris Yeltsin and how that might impact on 
U.S.-Russian relations?
    The President. No. I got another report after this morning's meeting 
with congressional leadership, and our latest report is that he seems to 
be resting well and feeling pretty good and making some decisions from 
the hospital. That's the latest report I got--is about 30 minutes ago.

Note: The exchange began at 10:44 a.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
this exchange.
