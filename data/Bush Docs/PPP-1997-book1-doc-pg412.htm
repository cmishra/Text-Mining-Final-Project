Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the 
National Endowment for Democracy
April 8, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:
    Pursuant to the provisions of section 504(h) of Public Law 98-164, 
as amended (22 U.S.C. 4413(i)), I transmit herewith the 13th Annual 
Report of the National Endowment for Democracy, which covers fiscal year 
1996.
    The report demonstrates the National Endowment for Democracy's 
unique contribution to the task of promoting democracy worldwide. The 
Endowment has helped consolidate emerging democracies--from South Africa 
to the former Soviet Union--and has lent its hand to grass-roots 
activists in repressive countries--such as Cuba, Burma, or Nigeria. In 
each instance, it has been able to act in ways that government agencies 
could not.
    Through its everyday efforts, the Endowment provides evidence of the 
universality of the democratic ideal and of the benefits to our Nation 
of our continued international engagement. The Endowment has received 
and should continue to receive strong bipartisan support.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

April 8, 1997.
