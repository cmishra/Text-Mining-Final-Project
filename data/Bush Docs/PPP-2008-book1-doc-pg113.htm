Statement on the Situation in Lebanon
January 26, 2008

    I strongly condemn the terrorist bombing in Beirut that killed 
Lebanese Internal Security Forces Captain Wissam Eid<Eid, 
Wissam<ls-thn-eq> and many other Lebanese. I extend condolences to the 
families of the innocent Lebanese killed in this brutal attack and hope 
for a rapid recovery for all those wounded.
    This bombing, the latest in a series of terrorist attacks targeting 
those who are working to secure Lebanon's independence and sovereignty, 
is a part of the continuing assault on Lebanon's institutions. We will 
not falter in our support for the democratically elected Lebanese 
Government. We renew our call for the immediate selection of a new 
President in accordance with Leb-

anon's Constitution. We demand that Syria, Iran, and their allies end 
        their interference in and obstruction of Lebanon's political 
        process.

    The Lebanese people should be able to enjoy security and liberty 
without the threat of terrorism, violence, and foreign intimidation. I 
appreciate the U.N.'s efforts to rapidly stand up the Special Tribunal 
for Lebanon, which will hold accountable those who are responsible for 
this systematic campaign of murder and intimidation. I urge Lebanon's 
friends and allies to commit immediately the remaining funds required 
for the tribunal to commence its work.
