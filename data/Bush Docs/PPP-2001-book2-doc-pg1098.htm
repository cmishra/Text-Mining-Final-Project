Remarks in Sarasota, Florida, on the Terrorist Attack on New York City's 
World Trade Center
September 11, 2001

    Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America. I, 
unfortunately, will be going back to Washington after my remarks. 
Secretary Rod Paige<Paige, Roderick R.> and the Lieutenant 
Governor<Brogan, Frank T.> will take the podium and discuss 
education. I do want to thank the folks here at Booker Elementary School 
for their hospitality.
    Today we've had a national tragedy. Two airplanes have crashed into 
the World Trade Center in an apparent terrorist attack on our country. I 
have spoken to the Vice President,<Cheney, Dick> to the 
Governor of New York,<Pataki, George E.> to the Director of 
the FBI<Mueller, Robert S., III> and have ordered that the 
full resources of the Federal Government go to help the victims and 
their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down 
and to find those folks who committed this act.
    Terrorism against our Nation will not stand.
    And now if you would join me in a moment of silence.

[A moment of silence was observed.]

    May God bless the victims, their families, and America.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 9:30 a.m. in the Media Center at Emma 
Booker Elementary School. In his remarks, the President referred to Lt. 
Gov. Frank T. Brogan of Florida and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York. 
At 8:46 a.m. American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade 
Center North, and at 9:05 a.m. United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into 
the World Trade Center South. Both flights were scheduled from Boston 
Logan International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport.
