Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Sudan
 November 1, 2007

To the Congress of the United States:
    The crisis constituted by the actions and policies of the Government 
of Sudan that led to the declaration of a national emergency in 
Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997, and the expansion of that 
emergency in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006, and with respect 
to which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13412 of October 
13, 2006, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are hostile 
to U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the 
national emergency declared with respect to Sudan and maintain in force 
the comprehensive sanctions against Sudan to respond to this threat.
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the Sudan emergency is to continue in effect beyond November 3, 2007.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 November 1, 2007.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
