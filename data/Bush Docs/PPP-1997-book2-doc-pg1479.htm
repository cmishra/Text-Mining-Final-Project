Message to the Congress Transmitting Line Item Vetoes of the Departments 
of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998
November 1, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the 
dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the 
attached reports, contained in the ``Departments of Veterans Affairs and 
Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations 
Act, 1998'' (Public Law 105-65; H.R. 2158). I have determined that the 
cancellation of these amounts will reduce the Federal budget deficit, 
will not impair any essential Government functions, and will not harm 
the national interest.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

November 1, 1997.

Note: The reports detailing the cancellations were published in the 
Federal Register on November 4.
