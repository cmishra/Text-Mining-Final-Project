Statement on House of Representatives Action on Victims of Trafficking 
and Violence Protection Legislation
October 6, 2000

    I applaud the House of Representatives for passing vital legislation 
today to combat trafficking in humans and strengthen and reauthorize the 
Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The ``Trafficking Victims Protection 
Act'' will provide important new tools in the campaign to combat 
trafficking, a modern form of slavery and an insidious human rights 
abuse. VAWA, which expired on September 30, has significantly improved 
the lives of thousands of women who are victims of domestic violence and 
has assisted State, local, and tribal law enforcement to combat domestic 
violence and sexual assault. It is imperative that this law be 
reauthorized this year, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation 
without delay.
