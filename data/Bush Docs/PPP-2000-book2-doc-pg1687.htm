Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the Proposed 
Acquisition of Verio by Japanese NTT Communications
August 23, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Attached is a report on my decision to take no action to suspend or 
prohibit the proposed acquisition of Verio, Inc., a large U.S.-based 
Internet Service Provider (ISP), by NTT Communications Corporation (NTT 
Communications), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corporation, (NTT). NTT is a Japanese corporation that is 
owned and controlled by the Government of Japan (GOJ). I have taken this 
decision under the authority vested in me as President by section 721 of 
the Defense Production Act of 1950, also known as the ``Exon-Florio'' 
provision, 50 U.S.C. App. 2170. This report is submitted pursuant to 
subsection (g) of the Exon-Florio provision.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
