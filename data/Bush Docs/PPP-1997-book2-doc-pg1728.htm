Text of a Letter to Shelia Davis Lawrence
December 8, 1997

    It is with a deep sense of personal sadness that I received your 
letter this afternoon. I will of course ensure that the Department of 
Defense accommodates your wishes.
    I will always remember Larry for his friendship and for his service 
to his community and our country. And I will never forget Larry's 
remarkable success as a businessman, his generosity as a philanthropist 
and his skill as a diplomat.
    I know this has been a difficult time for you and I sincerely hope 
that you find peace in the days ahead.

Note: The letter referred to Mrs. Lawrence's late husband, M. Larry 
Lawrence, former Ambassador to Switzerland. An original was not 
available for verification of the content of this letter.
