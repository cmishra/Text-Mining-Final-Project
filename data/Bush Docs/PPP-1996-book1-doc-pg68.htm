Statement on the Decision of Alan Blinder Not To Seek a Second Term as 
Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
January 17, 1996

    It is my deep regret to learn of Alan Blinder's decision not to seek 
a second term as Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System. Dr. Blinder's return to Princeton University is a 
tremendous gain for a respected university but a considerable loss for 
the Nation.
    Alan is a powerful force for sound and sensible monetary policy. His 
tenure at the Board was marked by integrity, intelligence, and candor. 
He will be greatly missed there as he was when he left the White House 
Council of Economic Advisers to become Vice Chairman.
