Statement on Senate Action on Trade Legislation
May 23, 2002

    Today's passage by the Senate of a vital package of trade 
legislation is a critical step in advancing America's trade agenda and 
strengthening the U.S. economy. As I begin my trip here in Europe, the 
passage of this bill sends an important signal to our trading partners 
that we are committed to free and open trade.
    Restoring trade promotion authority will give me the flexibility I 
need to secure the greatest possible trade opportunities for American 
workers, consumers, families, and farmers. The administration also 
supports expanding the Andean Trade Preferences Act in a way that 
reflects the economic realities of the region. ATPA will help the Andean 
economies grow through legitimate trade, while also enhancing our 
counternarcotics strategy.
    Every day the United States goes without trade promotion authority 
is another day the American people are deprived of the benefits of 
trade. Therefore, I urge the House and Senate to convene a conference 
committee immediately so they can resolve their differences and send me 
a trade promotion authority bill I can sign at the earliest opportunity.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 3009, the proposed ``Trade Act of 
2002.''
