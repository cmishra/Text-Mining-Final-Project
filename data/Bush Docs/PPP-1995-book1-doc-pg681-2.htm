Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on
Democracy Promotion Programs
May 11, 1995

Dear Mr. Chairman:
    I am pleased to transmit herewith a report on the democracy 
promotion programs funded by the United States Government. The report is 
required by section 534 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236).
    The report reviews the current status of U.S.-sponsored programs to 
promote democracy. As part of the Vice President's National Performance 
Review, agencies will be seeking ways to further streamline these 
programs in the coming months.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations, and Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman, House 
Committee on International Relations.
