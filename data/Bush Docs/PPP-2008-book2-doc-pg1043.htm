Remarks at a Celebration of Colombian Independence Day
July 22, 2008

    Gracias. Thank you. Sientese. Gracias. Buenos dias. Bienvenidos a la 
Casa Blanca. I am pleased to welcome you to the gathering of the 198th 
anniversary of Colombia's independence, which was celebrated last Sunday 
in grand style. Colombia and the United States have a long history of 
close ties. As many of you may know, Colombia supports [supplies]* 
America's primary source of energy, a resource that many Americans use, 
and we thank you for your coffee. [Laughter]

    Before we do, though, I want to--got some comments I'd like to make.
    The anniversary of Colombia's independence falls only a couple weeks 
after America's Independence Day celebration. And that's appropriate, 
because our two nations have much in common. Like the United States, 
Colombia gained its independence when a band of patriots rallied 
together against a distant monarchy. Like the United States, Colombia 
was unified in its earliest days by a daring general who became the 
country's first President. And like the United States, Colombia built a 
new government around the rule of law and the notion that liberty was an 
unalienable right.
    Our countries have shared a strong bond from the very beginning. In 
1822, President James Monroe was one of the first heads of state to 
recognize Colombia's independence. And that same year, America became

[[Page 1044]]

one of the first countries to establish a new diplomatic mission with 
that republic. From those strong foundations we built a lasting 
friendship on a mutual respect for liberty and a commitment to a more 
peaceful world.
    This friendship has endured through good times and bad. Less than a 
decade ago, it looked as if peace and freedom were on retreat in 
Colombia. The country was in the grip of drug cartels and kidnapers. The 
Marxist terrorist network known as the FARC threatened to overthrow the 
democratically elected government. These were tough times for our 
friend. Our two nations launched an ambitious program that helped rescue 
Colombia from the brink of becoming a failed state.
    Plan Colombia, which started under my predecessor,<Clinton, William 
J.<ls-thn-eq> made it clear that the United States would support the 
Colombian Government's efforts to modernize its military, to fight 
terrorists and drug kingpins, to expand educational opportunities, and 
provide Colombians with alternatives to a life of terror and 
narcotrafficking. The Colombian Government has taken the lead on this 
bold plan, and the United States has been proud to help. And today, Plan 
Colombia is working.
    One of the main reasons for Plan Colombia's success is the courage 
of Colombia's President,<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> President Uribe. 
President Uribe has taken bold stands to defend our shared democratic 
values. He has been a strong and capable partner in fighting drugs and 
crime and terror. He's demonstrated that he is deeply committed to 
providing a better future for the people of his country.
    Since President Uribe<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> took office, 
the Colombian Government reports that homicides have dropped by 40 
percent; kidnapings have dropped by more than 80 percent; terrorist 
attacks have dropped by more than 70 percent. Reforms to Colombia's 
criminal justice system have dramatically increased conviction rates. 
And last year, Colombia's economy saw its largest growth in nearly three 
decades. These are impressive achievements, and they're a testament to 
the determination of the Colombian people and their outstanding 
President.
    Earlier this month, President Uribe's<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> 
administration scored another impressive triumph. In a daring covert 
operation, members of the Colombian military infiltrated the FARC and 
convinced the terrorists to transfer 15 hostages, including<Gonsalves, 
Marc<ls-thn-eq> 3<Howes, Thomas<ls-thn-eq> Americans,<Stansell, 
Keith<ls-thn-eq> to a new location. Disguised Colombian agents arrived 
in a helicopter to carry out the transfer. And when the hostages lifted 
off, they were astonished to hear an Army officer say nine words they 
thought they would never hear: ``We are the Colombia Army, and you are 
free.''
    Today, three<Gonsalves, Marc<ls-thn-eq> Americans<Howes, 
Thomas<ls-thn-eq> are<Stansell, Keith<ls-thn-eq> back with their 
families because of the heroism of the Colombian allies. On behalf of 
our entire Nation, I welcome home Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and 
Keith Stansell. And I thank the brave members of the Colombian military 
who rescued them.
    The success of this rescue mission underscores the progress the 
Colombian Government has made. This progress is also evident in the 
hearts and minds of the Colombian people. On Sunday, more than a million 
Colombians marched in their nation's streets and called on FARC to 
release its remaining hostages and to stop practicing terror. They 
chanted a simple but powerful message: Libertad--that means freedom. 
[Laughter]
    America should support this noble stand by the Colombian people. And 
the single most important step we can do so is for the United States 
Congress to approve a Colombia free trade agreement that our countries 
signed more than a year and a half ago.
    Approving this agreement would strengthen our Nation's economy. 
Because of legislation that the Congress has passed--particularly the 
Andean Trade Preference Act--today, almost all Colombian exports enter 
the United States duty

[[Page 1045]]

free. The Congress made that decision. Yet our products exported to 
Colombia face tariffs of up to 35 percent, with rates even higher for 
some agricultural products. In other words, the current situation is 
one-sided. And the failure to approve the free trade agreement is 
hurting our businesses who want to sell their products into Colombia.
    Tariffs imposed on U.S. exports to Colombia are estimated to have 
exceeded $1.1 billion while the trade agreement has awaited 
congressional approval. Every day that passes without the agreement's 
approval, that number only gets bigger. Congress has already voted to 
allow duty-free access to American markets for Colombian products. Now 
Congress should create a level playing field; they ought to give 
American workers and farmers the same access to Colombia's markets. And 
the way for them to do though--that is to approve the free trade 
agreement.
    Opening markets is especially important during this time of economic 
uncertainty. Last year, exports accounted for more than 40 percent of 
America's total economic growth. Doesn't it make sense to continue that 
kind of growth during these economic uncertain times? I think it does. 
We ought to be working to open up new opportunities and new markets. 
More than 8,000 small and midsized American businesses export to 
Colombia. Approving this agreement will help these small businesses and 
middle-sized businesses grow their businesses and create high-paying 
jobs.
    Approving this agreement is also an urgent national security 
priority. It makes good economic sense, but it's important for our 
national security that the Congress approve this agreement. While the 
FARC has seen its power reduced, the terrorists are still actively 
plotting against the Colombian Government. Colombia also faces a hostile 
and anti-American neighbor in Venezuela, where the regime has forged an 
alliance with Cuba, collaborated with FARC terrorist leaders, and 
provided sanctuary to FARC units. It is in America's interests to stand 
by Colombia in the face of this threat, and the best way to do so is for 
Congress to allow a vote on the Colombia free trade agreement.
    President Uribe<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> has stood strong 
against tyranny and terror. He's done everything we have asked him to do 
and more. He's told Members of Congress that approving this agreement is 
one of the most important steps that America can take to show its 
support for Colombia. Now the Colombian people are waiting to see what 
our Congress will do. To demonstrate America's good faith, to stand by 
our strong friend, to send a clear signal that we appreciate our ally, 
the United States Congress must approve this free trade agreement.
    And once they do so, Congress should quickly approve our free trade 
agreements with Panama and South Korea. By doing so, they can reassure 
these countries that America will stand by its word, and that we will 
not abandon our friends.
    It's been nearly two centuries since the United States of America 
and the nation of Colombia forged a friendship in the earliest days of 
our independence. In the years since, both of our nations have learned 
that the cost of maintaining a free society is remaining vigilant 
against the enemies of freedom. We believe that freedom is the 
birthright of all. We believe that it is the responsibility of free 
nations to support one another against those who would undermine our 
freedom.
    The United States is committed to the security of Colombia; we're 
committed to defeating the forces of terror. Our countries can meet this 
challenge together. And through our partnership, we can usher in a new 
era of enhanced prosperity and peace in our neighborhood.
    I want to thank you for coming. Que Dios le bendiga.

Note: The President spoke at 1:41 p.m. in the East Room of the White 
House. In his

Citizens. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish 
language transcript of these remarks.
