Statement on Senate Confirmation of Samuel A. Alito, Jr.,<Alito, Samuel 
A., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> To Be an Associate Justice of the United States 
Supreme Court
January 31, 2006

    I am pleased that the Senate has voted to confirm Judge Sam Alito as 
the 110th Justice of the Supreme Court. Sam Alito is a brilliant and 
fair-minded judge who strictly interprets the Constitution and laws and 
does not legislate from the bench. He is a man of deep character and 
integrity, and he will make all Americans proud as a Justice on our 
highest Court. The son of an Italian immigrant, Judge Alito's 
appointment to the Supreme Court is the realization of the American 
dream for this good man and his family. I congratulate Judge Alito, his 
wife, Martha,<Alito, Martha-Ann<ls-thn-eq> the Alito<Alito, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> children,<Alito, Philip S.<ls-thn-eq> and Judge Alito's 
mother, Rose,<Alito, Rose<ls-thn-eq> on this historic achievement and 
momentous day in the life of our country.
    Judge Alito replaces Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.<O'Connor, Sandra 
Day<ls-thn-eq> Justice O'Connor was the first woman ever to sit on the 
Supreme Court, and she is one of the most admired Americans of our time 
or any time. Our Nation is grateful to Justice O'Connor for her 
extraordinary and dedicated public service, and Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish her and John<O'Connor, John J., 
III<ls-thn-eq> all the best.
