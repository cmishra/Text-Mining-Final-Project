Statement on Protection of Forest Roadless Areas
May 9, 2000

    The plan proposed today by Secretary Glickman<Glickman, 
Dan<ls-thn-eq> to prohibit road building in roadless areas of our 
national forests is an important step toward my goal of lasting 
protection for these priceless lands. These pristine areas are some of 
the last wild places in America, and I am firmly committed to preserving 
them for future generations. I commend the Forest Service for its 
extraordinary effort in developing this proposal and providing the 
American people with

every opportunity to help shape it. I encourage members of the public 
and all those with a stake in the future of our national forests to 
carefully review this proposal and make their voices heard as the Forest 
Service continues to develop and refine this historic initiative.
