                                Foreword

    This volume brings together my speeches and papers from the first 
half of 2002--a time of hard effort and achievement for our country.

    In the fall of 2001, I ordered our Armed Forces into battle in 
Afghanistan, with the mission of destroying terrorist training camps and 
removing the Taliban regime from power. Within 4 months after our Nation 
was attacked by terrorists, a coalition led by America had destroyed the 
training grounds of terror and liberated the Afghan people from the 
brutal rule of the Taliban. Working with a new interim government in 
Afghanistan, we began the work of building a democratic and peaceful 
nation.

    Military success in Afghanistan was one advance in America's broader 
war against terrorists and terror regimes. Across the world, from the 
Philippines to Africa, we continued to pursue the terrorists, to deny 
them funding, and to disrupt their operations. America made clear that 
the state sponsors of terror would be held to account--and I expressed 
our national determination to prevent terrorists from gaining weapons of 
mass destruction. In the first 6 months of 2002, America took 
unprecedented steps to defend our homeland and our people, changes that 
would soon lead to the establishment of the Department of Homeland 
Security.

    As we answered threats to our security, America took determined 
action to overcome the economic slowdown that had begun in 2000. My 
Administration worked with the Congress in extending unemployment 
benefits, to give extra help to citizens still looking for work. We 
passed tax relief, helping to create new jobs across the American 
economy. And we enacted serious reforms to stop the corporate abuses 
that had come to light in early 2002.

    One of the most significant domestic achievements recorded in this 
volume was the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Passed with bipartisan 
support in the Congress, this legislation promised to reverse old trends 
by requiring testing, measuring the progress of every student, and 
reporting results to parents. This law also made sure that the parents 
of children in poorly performing schools would have choices, whether 
tutoring, a charter school, or a higher achieving public school. After 
years of debate, the crucial principles of high standards and 
accountability were now the law of the land.

    Our Government made progress on other important priorities. We 
continued to call for reform in America's welfare system, to give job 
training and new opportunities to Americans in need. I continued to 
advocate my Administration's faith-based initiatives to encourage the 
compassionate work of religious people in their communities. We pressed 
for passage of a comprehensive energy plan to encourage conservation, 
promote domestic energy exploration, and modernize our aging electricity 
grid. And we moved forward with policies to protect our national parks 
and to safeguard our forests from catastrophic wildfires.

    This period in our country's history brought many challenges, and we 
responded actively at home and abroad. We also continued to put in place 
strategies that would help America respond to future dangers. And we 
upheld our foremost duty to protect the American people from harm. As I 
said to the U.S. Military Academy class of 2002, ``In the world we have 
entered, the only path to safety is the path of action. And this Nation 
will act.''

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 43d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period January 1-June 30, 2002. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Herbert Hoover, 
Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. 
Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, 
George Bush, and William J. Clinton are also included in the Public 
Papers series.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents publication program is under the 
direction of Frances D. McDonald, Managing Editor, Office of the Federal 
Register. The series is produced by the Presidential and Legislative 
Publications Unit, Gwendolyn J. Henderson, Chief. The Chief Editor of 
this book was Karen Howard Ashlin, assisted by Kathleen M. Fargey, 
Stephen J. Frattini, Christopher Gushman, Margaret A. Hemmig, Maxine 
Hill, Alfred Jones, Stacey A. Mulligan, Lydia C. Poon, Michael J. 
Sullivan, and Karen A. Thornton.

    The frontispiece and photographs used in the portfolio were supplied 
by the White House Photo Office. The typography and design of the book 
were developed by the Government Printing Office under the direction of 
Bruce R. James, Public Printer.
