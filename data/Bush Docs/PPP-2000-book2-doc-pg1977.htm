Statement on the Election in Yugoslavia
September 28, 2000

    The people of Yugoslavia have spoken loud and clear in support of 
democratic change.
    The opposition's claims to an absolute majority are backed up by 
certified results from the polling places. The Government's commission 
acted in secret and excluded the opposition. One of its top officials 
has resigned. The Serb Orthodox Church has recognized Mr. 
Kostunica<Kostunica, Vojislav> as Yugoslavia's new President.
    It is time for Mr. Milosevic<Milosevic, Slobodan> to heed 
the call of the Serb people, step down, and allow a peaceful democratic 
transition to take place.
    We have said before that as soon as a democratic government is in 
place, we will immediately take steps to remove economic sanctions and 
help Serbia with its transition.

Note: The statement referred to Yugoslav opposition candidate Vojislav 
Kostunica, and President Slobodan Milosevic of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
