Statement on House of Representatives Action on Community Economic 
Renewal Legislation
July 25, 2000

    I commend the House of Representatives for passing today the 
bipartisan new markets, empowerment zone, and community renewal 
legislation. At a time of unprecedented prosperity, too many Americans 
in our cities and rural areas still do not have access to investment 
capital and economic opportunity. This legislation will spur more 
private sector investment in these new markets so that all Americans can 
fully participate in our thriving economy. I look forward to working 
with Members of both parties in the House and the Senate this year to 
enact this historic and innovative legislation.
