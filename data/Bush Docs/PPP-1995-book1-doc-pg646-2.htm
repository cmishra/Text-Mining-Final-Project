Statement on the Death of Lewis Preston
May 5, 1995

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn today of the death of 
Lewis Preston.
    As President, Lewis Preston brought strong management to the World 
Bank. During a time of monumental change in the international arena, 
including the entry of the former Soviet Union into the free market and 
the emergence of a democratic South Africa, Lewis Preston provided 
steady leadership and helped to make the World Bank a more open and 
effective institution.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.
