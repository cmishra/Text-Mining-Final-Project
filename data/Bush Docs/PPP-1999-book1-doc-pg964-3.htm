Statement on the G-7 Agreement on Debt Relief for Poor Nations
June 18, 1999

    The G-7 agreement we reached today is an historic step to help the 
world's poorest nations achieve sustained growth and independence while 
targeting new resources for poverty reduction, education, and combating 
AIDS. It represents a sound, humane effort to promote widely shared 
prosperity in the new millennium.
