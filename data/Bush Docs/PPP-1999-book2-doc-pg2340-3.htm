Christmas Greeting to the Nation

    The President. On this holiest of holidays, Hillary and I would like 
to wish all of you a very merry Christmas. This is a season of joy, a 
time for family and friends to rejoice in one another's company and in 
the magic of Christmas.
    The First Lady.<Clinton, Hillary Rodham> At the dawn of 
this new millennium, let us reflect on our hopes, our dreams, and the 
gifts we can give to the future. Let us all cherish the gift of every 
child among us and pledge to build a world worthy of all our children.

throughout the new year. From our family to yours, merry Christmas, 
happy new year, may God bless you all.
