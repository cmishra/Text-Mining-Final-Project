Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process
July 15, 1999

    I share the regret that the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland 
feel at the setback in the peace process. They have voted overwhelmingly 
for peace. They want a permanent end to violence and to the potential 
for violence. The cry for a peaceful, inclusive, democratic society in 
Northern Ireland has never been stronger.
    Real progress has been made on all sides toward fulfilling the 
solemn commitments spelled out in the Good Friday agreement. It is 
incumbent on all parties to carry out their obligations

under that accord. I am convinced that it is possible to achieve full 
implementation of this historic agreement in all its aspects by next 
spring, as contemplated by its terms.
    The British and Irish Governments intend to conduct over the next 
few weeks an interim review of the implementation of the agreement aimed 
at overcoming the hurdles in the peace process. For the future of all 
the people of Northern Ireland who want an enduring peace and a normal 
life, I call upon all those involved to find the way to get the peace 
process back on track. I am ready to assist Prime Minister Blair,<Blair, 
Tony> Prime Minister Ahern,<Ahern, Bertie> and the 
parties in any way I can to achieve this goal.
