Remarks Announcing the Appointment of Edward W. Gillespie<Gillespie, 
Edward W.<ls-thn-eq> as White House Counselor to the President
June 13, 2007

    When Dan<Bartlett, Daniel J.<ls-thn-eq> told me that he was going to 
leave the White House so he could spend more time with his three young 
children and his wife, I never thought I'd be able to find somebody that 
could possibly do as good a job as he has done. I'm fortunate that Ed 
Gillespie has agreed to join the administration. He is a seasoned hand 
who has got excellent judgment. He's a good strategic thinker that I 
know will do a fine job.
    We're going to miss Dan.<Bartlett, Daniel J.<ls-thn-eq> He's been a 
friend of mine for--gosh, since 1993, but I fully understand why a young 
dad needs to be with his family. And I admire the fact that he has set 
such an important priority. And I also--thank you for your service.
    And I also thank Ed for agreeing to come over here to the White 
House. We've got a lot to do. We've got to continue laying the 
foundation for peace. We've got an immigration bill that will help 
enforce our borders. We've got an energy bill that we need to get out 
that will make us less dependent on foreign oil. And we've got to remind 
the Congress that they need to be fiscally wise with the people's money; 
that we can balance this budget of ours without raising taxes.
    And so, Ed, I'm looking forward to working with you. I thank you for 
your service. And, Bartlett,<Bartlett, Daniel J.<ls-thn-eq> good luck to 
you, brother. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:43 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House.
