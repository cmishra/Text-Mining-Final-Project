Remarks at a Church Service Honoring Martin Luther King, Jr., in 
Landover, Maryland
January 20, 2003

    Thank you all. Thank you. Now I understand why a Hechinger 
warehouse--[laughter]--can become a center of love and compassion and 
fire. I am honored--Laura<Bush, Laura> and I are honored that 
you would invite us and our friends, the Governor<Ehrlich, Robert L.>  
Jr. and the First Lady<Ehrlich, Kendel> and the 
Lieutenant Governor<Steele, Michael S.> and his lovely 
wife,<Steele, Andrea> to come and celebrate a great American.
    We're honored to be in the midst of a social entrepreneur whose 
guidebook for entrepreneurship to help others is the Bible. I want to 
thank the members of the church, the leaders of the church, and those 
who are in charge of the ministries of the church for sharing with us 
the good works of this church.
    It is fitting that we honor Martin Luther King in a church because, 
Gregory,<Foster, Gregory> I believe, like you, that the power 
of his words, the clarity of his vision, the courage of his leadership 
occurred because he put his faith in the Almighty.
    It is fitting that we honor the life of a great American in a church 
who derived his inspiration from the church. It is fitting that we honor 
this great American in a church because out of the church comes the 
notion of equality and justice. And even though progress has been 
made,<Jenkins, John K.>  Sr. Pastor--even though progress has 
been made, there is more to do. There are still people in our society 
who hurt. There is still prejudice holding people back. There is still a 
school system that doesn't elevate every child so they can learn. There 
is still a need for us to hear the words of Martin Luther King, to make 
sure the hope of America extends its reach into every neighborhood 
across this land.
    So it's fitting we're here in a church that has got ministries aimed 
at healing those who hurt, at fighting addiction, at promoting love and 
families. It is fitting we meet here in a church because in this 
society, we must understand: Government can help; Government can write 
checks; but it cannot put hope in people's hearts or a sense of purpose 
in people's lives.
    And so as we remember the dream of Martin Luther King and remember 
his clear vision for a society that's equal and a society full of 
justice, this society must remember the power of faith. This Government 
of yours must welcome faith, not discriminate faith, as we deal with the 
future of this great country.
    And so, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having Laura<Bush, 
Laura> and me. Thank you for allowing us to worship with you. 
Thank you for opening up our hearts to the glorious word. May God bless 
you all. May God bless the legacy of Martin Luther King.
