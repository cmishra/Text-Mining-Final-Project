Statement on National Donate Life Month
April 23, 2008

    During National Donate Life Month, we show our appreciation for our 
fellow Americans who have saved lives by becoming organ, tissue, marrow, 
and blood donors, and we honor the health care professionals, 
researchers, and others involved in this lifesaving work. I was pleased 
today to meet with organ donors, medical professionals, and organ 
recipients, all of whom participated in a historic six-recipient kidney 
transplant in which six patients received

new organs from six unrelated living donors. This history-making medical 
event took place 3 weeks ago at Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant 
Center. These people are all firsthand witnesses to the gift of life, 
or, in this case, lives.
    We are blessed to have a health care system that is the best in the 
world and includes skilled medical professionals like those I met with 
today. We are also blessed to be a nation filled with generous and 
compassionate people. The selflessness of those who are donors is an 
inspiration.
    Unfortunately, thousands of Americans are on waiting lists for an 
organ or tissue transplant. I urge all Americans to make the decision to 
donate. For information about becoming an organ and tissue donor, go to 
organdonor.gov. Talk to your family, talk to your friends, and register. 
You can give a transforming gift of life.

Note: The National Donate Life Month proclamation of April 1 is listed 
in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
