Statement on Senate Action on Legislation To Strengthen Border Security 
and Urging Action on Immigration Legislation
April 18, 2002

    Improving our Nation's border security is vital to protecting 
Americans from future terrorist attacks. I commend the Senate for 
passing legislation that strengthens border security and gives our law 
enforcement officials additional tools to secure our homeland. I look 
forward to Congress sending me this important legislation as soon as 
possible so that I can sign it into law.
    I also continue to urge Congress to act to strengthen families and 
make America more welcoming. Congress should pass a temporary extension 
under 245(i) so that immigrants eligible to become legal residents will 
not be forced to leave the country and their families to have their 
immigration status resolved.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish version 
of this statement.
