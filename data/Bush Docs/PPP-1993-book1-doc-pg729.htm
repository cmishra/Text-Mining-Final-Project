Message to the Congress Transmitting District of Columbia Budget 
Requests
May 24, 1993

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and 
Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the District of 
Columbia Government's 1994 budget request and 1993 budget supplemental 
request.
    The District of Columbia Government has submitted a 1994 budget 
request for $3,389 million in 1994 that includes a Federal payment of 
$671.5 million, the amount authorized and requested by the Mayor and 
City Council. The President's recommended 1994 Federal payment level of 
$653 million is also included in the District's 1994 budget as an 
alternative level. My transmittal of the District's budget, as required 
by law, does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
    I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the 1994 
appropriation process.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
May 24, 1993.
