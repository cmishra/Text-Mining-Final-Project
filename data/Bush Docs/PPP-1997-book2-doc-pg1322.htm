Statement on Action Against Terrorist Organizations
October 8, 1997

    Last year I signed into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death 
Penalty Act. It authorizes the Secretary of State, in consultation with 
the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, to designate an 
organization that engages in terrorist activity a foreign terrorist 
organization if it threatens the national security of the United States. 
The law prevents any fundraising or other financial transactions by 
these groups in the U.S. Heavy criminal penalties will also be levied 
against individuals in the United States who provide material support or 
resources to these terrorist organizations. Together, these provisions 
will help deprive terrorist groups of the resources they need to finance 
their acts of destruction.
    Today Secretary Albright has designated 30 foreign organizations as 
terrorist groups. Now we will work to uncover those who raise money for 
them in America and encourage our friends and allies to do the same 
within their own borders.
    The Secretary's designations are part of our ongoing fight against 
those who would undermine freedom and prosperity by violent acts. Just 
as we must reward and encourage the builders of peace and democracy, we 
must give no quarter to the enemies of these aspirations. Today's action 
sends a clear message: The path to change is through dialog and open 
deliberation, not violence and hatred. The United States is committed to 
fight against those who speak the language of terror.

Note: The designation of foreign terrorist organizations was published 
in the Federal Register on October 8 (62 FR 52650).
