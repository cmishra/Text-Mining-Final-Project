Statement on the Terrorist Attack on Americans in the Gaza Strip
October 15, 2003

    I condemn in the strongest terms the vicious act of terrorism 
directed against Americans in Gaza today. We are working closely with 
the appropriate officials to bring the terrorists to justice.
    Palestinian authorities should have acted long ago to fight terror 
in all its forms. The failure to create effective Palestinian security 
forces dedicated to fighting terror continues to cost lives. There must 
be an empowered Prime Minister who controls all Palestinian security 
forces, reforms that continue to be blocked by Yasser Arafat.<Arafat, 
Yasser<ls-thn-eq> The failure to undertake these reforms and dismantle 
the terrorist organizations constitutes the greatest obstacle to 
achieving the Palestinian people's dream of statehood.
    The Americans who were attacked today were pursuing a vision for a 
better future for the Palestinian people. The U.S. Embassy officials 
traveling in Gaza were there to interview young Palestinian candidates 
seeking Fulbright scholarships to study in the United States. This is 
another example of how the terrorists are enemies of progress and 
opportunity for the Palestinian people.
    On behalf of the American people, I send my heartfelt condolences to 
the families of the brave Americans who were killed and injured serving 
our country and its ideals.
