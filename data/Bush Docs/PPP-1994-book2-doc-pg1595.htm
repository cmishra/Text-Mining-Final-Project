Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Emigration Policies of 
Russia
September 21, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:
    I hereby transmit a report concerning the emigration laws and 
policies of the Russian Federation as required by subsections 402(b) and 
409(b) of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''). I 
have determined that the Russian Federation is in full compliance with 
the criteria in subsections 402(a) and 409(a) of the Act. As required by 
Title IV, I will provide the Congress with periodic reports regarding 
the Russian Federation's compliance with these emigration standards.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
September 21, 1994.
