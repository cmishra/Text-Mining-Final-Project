Telephone Remarks From Norfolk, Virginia, to United States Troops at 
Aviano Air Base in Italy
April 1, 1999

    The President. Colonel Nichols,<Nichols, David> I know 
you're about to leave on a mission. I just called to tell you we're 
proud of you, and we appreciate you and all your Buzzards there at the 
510th and all the other people who are carrying out this difficult 
mission.
    And you<Nichols, David> may know that I'm down in 
Virginia, and I just met with some service families to tell them how 
much I appreciate their sacrifice. And I know many of you have families 
back home pulling for you, as well.
    So I just want to tell you<Nichols, David> that and tell 
you how proud we are. I'm here with Secretary Cohen<Cohen, William 
S.> and General Shelton<Shelton, Henry H.> and a 
number of other people from Washington, and we're all there for you.
    Lt. Col. David <Nichols, David>Nichols. Thank you, Mr. 
President, sir. You have the 81st and the 23d Fighter Squadrons here 
also. It's a great team. And we are truly honored to have the privilege 
to hear your voice this afternoon.
    The President. Well, thank you.<Nichols, David> I know 
that I'm taking you almost up to your departure time, and I don't want 
to keep you late for your mission. But you just know we're all proud of 
you, and what you're doing is very important for our country and for the 
future of the world. And we thank you very much.
    Goodbye.

Note: The President spoke at 12:46 p.m. from the dining room of the 
Pennsylvania House at Norfolk Naval Station, to Lieutenant Colonel 
Nichols, USAF, Commanding Officer, 510th Fighter Squadron. A tape was 
not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
