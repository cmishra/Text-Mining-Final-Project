Remarks at the Federal Emergency Management Agency Joint Field Office in 
Baton Rouge, Louisiana
September 25, 2005

    The President. Thank you all. The Governor and I just got briefed by 
Admiral Allen<Allen, Thad W.<ls-thn-eq> on the progress here in 
Louisiana. There's still assessment on the damage of Hurricane Rita. One 
of the things that is important for the citizens of this State to do is 
to listen to the Governor about when it is okay to return back to your 
homes. I know a lot of people want to get back home. It's important that 
there be an orderly process. It's important there be an assessment done 
of infrastructure, and it's important for the people of the affected 
areas of Louisiana to listen carefully to the Governor<Blanco, Kathleen 
Babineaux<ls-thn-eq> and local authorities about the proper timing of 
return home.
    We also got briefed on the levees in New Orleans. There is flooding, 
obviously, in the

ninth ward. The Corps of Engineers gave us a briefing about the 
building--repairing levees and then, once again, pumping the water out 
of that part of New Orleans. It's--I would say it's an optimistic 
appraisal, in the sense that work has started now, and they can start 
to--draining that part of the city again.
    But I'm here to really thank the people in the Operations Center for 
their hard work and their dedication to helping the people of Louisiana 
recover from a second major storm in a very quick period of time.
    Governor,<Blanco, Kathleen Babineaux<ls-thn-eq> thank you for your 
hospitality, again. I know you've been through a lot, and I know the 
people of this State have been through a lot. We ask for God's blessings 
on them and their families.
    Thank you.
    Governor Blanco.<Blanco, Kathleen Babineaux<ls-thn-eq> Well, we want 
to welcome you back. I'm sorry that we brought you back under another 
stressful event. But we do appreciate your support. And I do want to 
tell you how much we appreciated watching all of the integrated forces 
at work as one. And as we talked, I know that it was possible to do it 
quickly, and to move in as one, with Federal, State, and local folks 
working all together.
    We talked about what happens next here and how quickly we could 
marshal the right kind of forces again. And I think that, together, 
we're going to work out some very important plans that citizens of the 
United States can feel will work very effectively and efficiently.
    Thank you.
    The President. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 12:08 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana; and Vice Adm. Thad W. 
Allen, USCG, U.S. Coast Guard Chief of Staff.
