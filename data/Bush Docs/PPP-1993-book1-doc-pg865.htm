Statement on National Service Legislation
June 16, 1993

    I've always said that national service would be America at its best. 
In reporting out the national service legislation, today two key 
committees were Congress at its best as well.
    National service is not about political partisanship. It is about 
America and the values that all of us share. National service will do so 
much that must be done: meeting our country's needs, paying for our 
children's education, and bringing all of us together in the common work 
of citizenship.
    Democrats and Republicans joined together today in a spirit of 
service to support this initiative. Senator Ted Kennedy and 
Representative Bill Ford continued to provide exemplary leadership in 
moving this legislation forward on a bipartisan basis.
    We've known for a long time that national service will bring 
Americans together. It's good to see that it brings Congress together as 
well.
