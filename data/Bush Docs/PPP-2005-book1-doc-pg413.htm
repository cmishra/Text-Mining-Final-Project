Statement on Senate Passage of Bankruptcy Reform Legislation
March 10, 2005

    I applaud the strong bipartisan vote in the Senate to curb abuses of 
the bankruptcy system. By reforming the system with this commonsense 
approach, more Americans--especially lower income Americans--will have 
greater access to credit. I urge the House to act quickly on bankruptcy 
legislation.
