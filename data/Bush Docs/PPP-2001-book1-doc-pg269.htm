Exchange With Reporters at the George Bush Center for Intelligence in 
Langley
March 20, 2001

Visit to the Central Intelligence Agency

    Q. Good briefing, Mr. President?
    The President. It was really interesting. Our Nation is fortunate to 
have so many dedicated men and women serve the country, and a lot of 
really good folks who work here. They've got one thing in mind, and that 
is how to serve America, how to provide the best information possible so 
that we can live in a peaceful world.
    There are a lot of people in this world that really resent our 
country and resent what we stand for. The good folks in this building 
are doing everything they can to provide enough information for us to be 
able to protect our way of life and protect our people. And I'm really 
touched by being here. And I'm so grateful for the hospitality, Mr. 
Director.<Tenet, George J.<ls-thn-eq>

Situation in Macedonia

    Q. Mr. President, a quick question on Macedonia. What should the 
United States do about the fighting that is taking place?
    The President. Well, we're going to work with our allies to bring 
peace to that region. We're very much involved through the NATO process, 
and we'll work with the Macedonian Government to help Macedonia protect 
its own borders.
    Q. Should the U.S. be giving the Macedonian military assistance?
    The President. We'll work with NATO to develop a strategy that will 
help Macedonia protect herself.

Note: The exchange began at 6:26 p.m. at CIA headquarters. A tape was 
not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
