Remarks at a State Dinner Honoring Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi<Berlusconi, Silvio<ls-thn-eq> of Italy
October 13, 2008

    Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Vice President,<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> Mrs. 
Cheney,<Cheney, Lynne<ls-thn-eq> Madam Speaker,<Pelosi, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> 
Members of Congress, Justices of the Supreme Court, members of my 
Cabinet, honored guests: Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are so 
pleased to welcome you to the White House.
    Every year on Columbus Day, we remember the remarkable history that 
unites America and Italy. That history began more than five centuries 
ago when an Italian explorer sighted land after a long ocean voyage. 
Many believed Christopher Columbus had reached the Far East, but another 
Italian explorer helped show otherwise. Amerigo Vespucci's journeys 
revealed that the land was a new world, and America will always be proud 
to carry his name.
    Through the years, generations of Italian immigrants have made their 
own voyage to the New World. They brought with them a vibrant culture 
and a strong sense of family. And today, their children and 
grandchildren have risen to some of the highest offices in our land. 
Among our guests tonight is the first Italian American Speaker of the 
House, and first woman, Nancy Pelosi.<Pelosi, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> And we're 
also honored to be joined by the first Italian American Justices of the 
United States Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia<Scalia, Antonin<ls-thn-eq> 
and Samuel Alito.<Alito, Samuel A., Jr.<ls-thn-eq>
    The ties between the people of America and the people of Italy run 
deep, and the friendship between our countries has never been stronger. 
The United States and Italy are standing together against the forces of 
tyranny and terror. We're partnering to meet the challenges in our 
economies and expand trade and prosperity. And we share a vision of a 
future of freedom and hope for all the people.
    Mr. Prime Minister, you're a strong leader. I admire your 
enterprising spirit, your

visionary leadership, and your commitment to your word. I've enjoyed 
serving with you on the world stage. I'm honored to call you a close 
friend.
    And it is now my privilege to offer a toast to the Prime Minister of 
Italy, Silvio Berlusconi.

Note: The President spoke at 8:06 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary also included the remarks of Prime Minister Berlusconi.
