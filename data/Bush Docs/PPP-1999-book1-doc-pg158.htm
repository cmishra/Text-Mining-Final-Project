Statement on People Magazine's Decision To Print a Cover Story Featuring 
Chelsea Clinton<Clinton, Chelsea>
February 3, 1999

    We deeply regret and are profoundly saddened by the decision of 
People magazine to print a cover story featuring our daughter, Chelsea. 
For over 6 years, the media has understood and respected the unique 
situation facing Chelsea as she grows up in the spot light focused on 
her parents. Other than at public situations where she is an integral 
part of our family, Chelsea has not taken on a public role. We have been 
very grateful for the media's restraint in allowing Chelsea the privacy 
that any young person needs and deserves.
    Unfortunately, despite personal appeals with respect to her privacy 
and her security from her parents, People magazine has chosen to run the 
story. We can only hope that the media will continue its policy of 
restraint with respect to our daughter.

Note: This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
as a statement by the President and the First Lady.
