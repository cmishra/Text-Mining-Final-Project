Statement on the Ulster Unionist Council Vote in Northern Ireland
May 27, 2000

    I am delighted that, with today's historic developments, the 
Northern Ireland peace process is back on track. I congratulate David 
Trimble<Trimble, David<ls-thn-eq> and the Ulster Unionist Council on 
their decision to return to self-government in Northern Ireland. This is 
a giant step toward fulfillment of the historic promise of the Good 
Friday accord to provide self-government to all the people on the basis 
of equality, consent, and the use of exclusively peaceful means. The 
parties are now ready to reenter the Executive and Legislative Assembly 
in the coming days. It is now possible for the politics of conflict to 
be transformed into the politics of consensus. I applaud the leadership 
of Tony Blair,<Blair, Tony<ls-thn-eq> Bertie Ahern,<Ahern, 
Bertie<ls-thn-eq> and all the parties. The wind is back in the sails of 
peace in Northern Ireland.

Note: The statement referred to Ulster Unionist Party leader and 
Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble; Prime Minister Tony Blair 
of the United Kingdom; and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland.
