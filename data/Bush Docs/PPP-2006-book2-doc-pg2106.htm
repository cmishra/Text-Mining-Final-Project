    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are honored to be here at the 
center of an effort to help Vietnam battle HIV/AIDS. And, doctor,<Tien, 
Nguyen Thi Kim<ls-thn-eq> thank you for this wonderful tour. We've got a 
comprehensive strategy involved through our PEPFAR program with the 
country. We've got a very strong mother-to-child transmission program to 
prevent the children from developing HIV/AIDS.
    The doctor<Tien, Nguyen Thi Kim<ls-thn-eq> has been explaining to us 
their strategy on how to detect HIV/AIDS not only in the cities but in 
the Provinces. And part of our comprehensive strategy to help this 
country is to distribute antiretroviral drugs.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I have come by to thank the 
doctor<Tien, Nguyen Thi Kim<ls-thn-eq> and her staff for their 
compassionate work and to assure the Vietnamese people that we will 
still help them fight HIV/AIDS.
