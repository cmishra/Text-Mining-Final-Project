Message on the Observance of Passover, 1997
April 21, 1997

    Warm greetings to everyone observing Passover.
    Commemorating God's liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian 
slavery, Passover is the story of a people who, sustained by their faith 
in God and strengthened by their own courage and determination, broke 
free from oppression to seek a new life in a new land. Their journey was 
long and full of peril, and their resolve sometimes shaken by doubt; but 
ultimately the Jewish people reached the Promised Land,

where they could live and worship and raise their children in the sweet 
air of freedom.
    The ageless festival of Passover holds profound meaning for 
Americans. We began our nation's journey to freedom more than two 
hundred years ago, a journey that is still not complete. Now we look 
forward to a new century and a new millennium, strengthened by the 
knowledge that we, too, have been blessed by God with the vision of a 
land of great promise set aside for those who cherish freedom.
    As we mark the observance of another Passover, let us renew our 
commitment to America's promise. Let us continue our journey to a land 
where all our people are free to pursue our common dreams--to live in 
peace, to provide for our families, and to give our children the 
opportunity for a better life.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a joyous Passover 
celebration.

                                                            Bill Clinton
