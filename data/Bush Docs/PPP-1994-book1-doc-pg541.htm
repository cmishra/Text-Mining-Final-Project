Statement Announcing a Meeting With Native American Leaders
March 23, 1994

    I look forward to this historic meeting and to affirming our 
commitment to strengthening the nation-to-nation relationship we have 
with tribal governments.
Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
a meeting with American Indian and Alaska Native tribal leaders at the 
White House on April 29.
