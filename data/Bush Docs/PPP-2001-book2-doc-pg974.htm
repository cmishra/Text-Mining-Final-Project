Exchange With Reporters in Albuquerque, New Mexico
August 15, 2001

Situation in the Middle East

    Q. One question about the Middle East, sir. Do you believe that they 
are on the brink of war there? And have you come to believe that it's no 
longer realistic----
    The President. [Inaudible]--the violence in the Middle East, but I'm 
confident that the leadership there will understand that war is 
avoidable and will work to bring peace. The parties must--must--make up 
their mind that peace is preferable to war. The suicide bombings have 
increased; there's too many of them. And Mr. Arafat<Arafat, 
Yasser> must do everything in his power to discourage the 
suicide bombers. And the Israelis must be restrained in their response.
    There's too much violence in the Middle East, but I'm confident that 
we can avoid war so long as the leadership makes the concerted effort to 
do so. My administration is constantly in touch with the parties. I 
spoke to Secretary Powell<Powell, Colin L.> this morning. 
We're working with the appropriate folks. The Egyptians are in town. Not 
only are we talking to the Palestinians and the Israelis, we're talking 
to other nations in the neighborhood to encourage them to convince Mr. 
Arafat<Arafat, Yasser> to do everything he can to prevent and 
stop suicide bombings and needless violence.
    Congratulations, Gregory [David Gregory, NBC News]. You actually got 
me to say something. [Laughter]
      
      
      

Note: The exchange began at 11:40 a.m. in room 117 at Griegos Elementary 
School. In his remarks, the President referred to Chairman Yasser Arafat 
of the Palestinian Authority. A tape was not available for verification 
of the content of this exchange.
