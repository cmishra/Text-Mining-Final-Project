Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Notice of Intention To 
Enter Into a Free Trade Agreement With Panama
March 30, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002, 
(Public Law 107-210; the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the 
Congress of my intention to enter into a free trade agreement with the 
Republic of Panama.
    The United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (the 
``Agreement'') will generate export opportunities for U.S. farmers, 
ranchers, and companies, help create jobs in the United States, and help 
American consumers save money while offering them more choices. The 
Agreement will also benefit the people of Panama by providing economic 
opportunity and by strengthening democracy.
    Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at 
least 90 days in advance of signing the Agreement. My Administration 
looks forward to working with the Congress in developing appropriate 
legislation to approve and implement this Agreement.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. The 
notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
