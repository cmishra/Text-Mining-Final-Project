Statement on Proposed Crime Legislation
July 22, 1994

    For over a year, Congress and others have worked to pass a tough, 
smart crime bill. I am very grateful to Chairmen Jack Brooks and Joe 
Biden for their leadership throughout the crime bill debate, and I am 
heartened to know that the House-Senate conference will convene next 
Tuesday to begin its final work on the proposal.
    We have put together a tough and serious legislative remedy to 
reduce violence and prevent crime. But until a bill is passed by 
Congress and signed into law, our work is not finished. I am confident 
that committee members will act quickly on the conference and that we 
will see a final bill passed.

    The American people have asked us to help in our Nation's fight to 
curb the problem of violence and crime. We can meet this common goal by 
putting aside differences and partisanship. By working together, we will 
enact an historic crime law before the end of this legislative session. 
The American people demand and deserve no less.
