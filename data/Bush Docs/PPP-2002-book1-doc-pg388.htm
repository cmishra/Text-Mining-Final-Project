Statement on House of Representatives Action on Border Security 
Legislation
March 12, 2002

    I applaud the House for working in a bipartisan fashion to pass 
legislation that strengthens border security while recognizing the 
importance of keeping families together and making America a more 
welcoming society. Many immigrants who are otherwise eligible to become 
legal residents will be forced to leave the United States and their 
families unless a temporary extension is granted. The Senate should act 
quickly to pass this legislation and send it to my desk for signature.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
