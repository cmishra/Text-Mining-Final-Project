Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Department of 
Defense Appropriations Bill
July 8, 2003

    I commend the House for passing the Department of Defense 
Appropriations bill. The House action will help strengthen and transform 
our military to keep America safe from the threats of this new era. The 
bill also continues my long-term commitment

to improving the quality of life for our troops and their families 
through higher pay and good benefits. I am pleased the House has acted 
quickly and in a fiscally responsible manner, and I look forward to 
continuing to work with the Congress to ensure that we have the 
resources necessary to support our troops.
