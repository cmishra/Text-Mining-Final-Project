Statement on the Situation in Burma
December 11, 2007

    I am deeply disturbed by the report that U.N. Special Rapporteur 
Paulo Pinheiro<Pinheiro, Paulo S.<ls-thn-eq> released today in Geneva 
documenting his findings from his trip to Burma last month. It provides 
further alarming details about the Burmese authorities' crackdown on 
demonstrations by monks and democracy activists and the severe reprisals 
that continue today.
    He<Pinheiro, Paulo S.<ls-thn-eq> describes how the regime harassed, 
detained, and killed many peaceful demonstrators. The Special Rapporteur 
received reports, for example, that a large number of bodies were burned 
September 27-30 at the Ye Way Crematorium.
    I strongly condemn these actions and the junta's refusal to accept 
the need for real change in Burma. Even while Mr. Pinheiro<Pinheiro, 
Paulo S.<ls-thn-eq> was in Burma, the regime continued to arrest and 
harass monks and democracy activists. The regime has also closed down 
monasteries, including the Maggin Monastery in Rangoon that served as a 
hospice and treatment center for HIV/AIDS patients.
    Mr. Pinheiro's<Pinheiro, Paulo S.<ls-thn-eq> report demonstrates why 
the world cannot go back to business as usual with General Than 
Shwe<Than Shwe<ls-thn-eq> and his junta. I call on all members of the 
international community to condemn the atrocities detailed in Mr. 
Pinheiro's report in the strongest possible terms. Last month, I 
announced new sanctions on the leaders of the regime and their cronies. 
Should the regime continue to ignore calls for a true democratic 
transition and the release of Aung San Suu Kyi<Aung San Suu 
Kyi<ls-thn-eq> and other political prisoners, the United States is 
prepared to lead international efforts to place more sanctions on the 
regime. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I will continue to stand with 
the Burmese people as they seek the freedom they deserve.

Note: The President referred to Senior Gen. Than Shwe, Chairman, State 
Peace and Development Council of Burma; and Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of 
the National League for Democracy in Burma.
