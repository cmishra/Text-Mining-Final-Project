Message on the Observance of Id al-Fitr
February 7, 1997

    On behalf of all Americans, I want to extend greetings to all 
Muslims in the United States and around the world as you celebrate Id 
al-Fitr.
    This celebration, which marks the end of a month of fasting and 
sacrifice, is an occasion for rejoicing. It is an opportunity for 
Muslims to gather in joy, as well as in remembrance of those less 
fortunate.
    It is also an opportunity for all of us to rededicate ourselves, not 
only to achieving spiritual growth, but also to the cause of peace 
between all peoples of the earth. It is our common challenge and our 
shared responsibility to create a better world for ourselves and our 
children.
    To all who practice the faith of Islam, in the United States and 
abroad, Hillary and I extend our very best wishes. May peace be with you 
and your families, and may God grant you health and prosperity now and 
in the year ahead.

                                                            Bill Clinton
