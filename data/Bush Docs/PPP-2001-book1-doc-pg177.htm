To the Congress of the United States:
    Pursuant to section 1053 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2001 
(Public Law 106-398), enclosed is a comprehensive report detailing the 
specific steps taken by the Federal Government to develop critical 
infrastructure assurance strategies as outlined by Presidential Decision 
Directive No. 63 (PDD-63).
    This report was drafted by the previous Administration and is a 
summary of their efforts as of January 15. However, since this 
requirement conveys to my Administration, I am forwarding the report.
    Critical infrastructure protection is an issue of importance to U.S. 
economic and national security, and it will be a priority in my 
Administration. We intend to examine the attached report and other
