January 9, 2009

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense

Subject: Provision of Atomic Information to Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia

    In your memorandum to me of August 1, 2008, you recommended that I 
approve pursuant to sections 123 and 144b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended, an agreement for cooperation within the context of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as between the Government of 
the United States and the following seven new members of NATO: the 
Republic of Bulgaria, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, 
the Republic of Lithuania, Romania, the Slovak Republic, and the 
Republic of Slovenia, hereinafter the ``New Parties.'' The subject 
agreement is the Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic 
Treaty for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information, including a 
technical annex and security annex (hereinafter collectively referred to 
as the ATOMAL Agreement), which entered into force on March 12, 1965, 
with respect to the United States and the other members of NATO at that 
time.
    Having considered your recommendations and the cooperation provided 
for in the ATOMAL Agreement with respect to the New Parties, in 
accordance with sections 123 and 144b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended, I hereby:
    a. Determine that the performance of the ATOMAL Agreement, including 
the proposed cooperation and the proposed communication of Restricted 
Data thereunder, with respect to the New Parties, will promote, and will 
not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security.
    b. Approve the ATOMAL Agreement with respect to the New Parties.
    c. Authorize the Department of Defense to cooperate with the New 
Parties to the ATOMAL Agreement in the context of NATO upon satisfaction 
of the requirements of section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended.

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on January 12.
