Remarks at a State Dinner Honoring President Nicolas Sarkozy<Sarkozy, 
Nicolas<ls-thn-eq> of France
November 6, 2007

    Mr. President, distinguished guests: Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
and I offer you a warm welcome to the White House, or should I say, 
``Bienvenue a la Maison Blanche.'' [Laughter]
    In 1777, another George W. welcomed to America another Frenchman. 
His name was Lafayette. The two leaders built a strong friendship based 
on common values and common virtues. They both recognized the power of 
human freedom. They both served with courage in freedom's cause, and 
they both anticipated that freedom would advance in other lands 
following its victory here in America.
    Two centuries later, our two nations are honoring the legacy of 
Lafayette by helping others resist tyranny and terror. French and 
American troops are helping to defend a young democracy in Afghanistan. 
Our two

nations support the democratic Government of Lebanon. We agree that 
reconciliation and democracy in Iraq are vital to the future of the 
Middle East. And our two nations condemn violations of human rights in 
Darfur, in Burma, and around the world.
    France and the United States can meet great challenges when we work 
together, Mr. President. You and I share a commitment to deepen the 
cooperation of our two republics, and through this cooperation, we can 
make the world a better place.
    I look forward to our discussions at Mount Vernon, where George 
Washington welcomed his friend Lafayette. And in the spirit of our 
friendship, I offer a toast to you and to some of America's oldest 
friends, the free people of France.

Note: The President spoke at 7:35 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary also included the remarks of President Sarkozy.
