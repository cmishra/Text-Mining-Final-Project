Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Members of Congress
September 25, 2008

    I want to thank the leaders of the House and the Senate for coming. 
I appreciate our Presidential<Obama, Barack<ls-thn-eq> 
candidates<McCain, John<ls-thn-eq> for being here as well.
    We are in a serious economic crisis in the country if we don't pass 
a piece of legislation. I want to thank the spirit of bipartisan 
cooperation that's taking place here in Washington. One thing the 
American people have to know is that all of us around the table take 
this issue very seriously, and we know we've got to get something done 
as quickly as possible. And this meeting is an attempt to move the 
process forward. My hope is that we can reach an agreement very shortly.
    I want to thank the Secretary of the Treasury<Paulson, Henry M., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> for working hard with the Members. I thank the Members 
for working long hours like they've been doing to come up with a 
solution that's bipartisan and that will solve the problem.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 4:03 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Sen. Barack Obama, Democratic 
Presidential nominee; and Sen. John McCain, Republican Presidential 
nominee. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish 
language transcript of these remarks.
