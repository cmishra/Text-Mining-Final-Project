in this hour of grief. Noting that the victims included innocent 
civilians of many nationalities, including an Indonesian citizen, the 
two leaders agreed that these indiscriminate attacks have no place in a 
civilized world.
    The two Presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of 
religious freedom and tolerance in relations within and among nations. 
As leader of the world's largest Muslim population and third largest 
democracy, President Megawati joined President Bush in underlining the 
importance of differentiating between the religion of Islam and the acts 
of violent extremists. Emphasizing that Islam is a religion of peace 
that neither teaches hatred nor condones violence, President 
Megawati<Megawati Sukarnoputri> encouraged President Bush in 
his stated purpose of building a broad coalition across religious lines 
and cultures to deal with these new and dangerous threats. She further 
emphasized the importance of taking into account the views of the Muslim 
world as the United States leads an appropriate response to the events 
of September 11. Noting that Islam is the fastest growing religion in 
the United States, President Bush assured President Megawati that the 
American people respect Islam as one of the world's great religions and 
that the United States would join hands with freedom-loving people of 
all religions to combat transnational terror.
