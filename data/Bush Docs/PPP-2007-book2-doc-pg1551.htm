Statement on the Formation of the National Council of the Damascus 
Declaration
December 14, 2007

    I applaud the recent formation of the National Council of the 
Damascus Declaration in Damascus, Syria. The brave men and women who 
formed this council reflect the desires of the majority of Syrian people 
to live in freedom, democracy, and peace, both at home and alongside 
their neighbors in the region.
    The Syrian regime continues to hold hundreds of prisoners of 
conscience and has arrested more than 30 national council members in the 
past few days. All those detained should be released immediately.
    The Syrian regime continues to deny its citizens fundamental human 
rights, including freedom of expression, freedom of movement, and the 
right to elect a representative government responsive to their needs. 
The formation of the national council is an encouraging sign to all 
people who support freedom and democracy. We support the national 
council's principles of nonviolent struggle and open membership to all 
the people of Syria who believe the time has come for change.
