Statement on Signing the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment 
Rights Act of 1994
October 13, 1994

    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 995, the ``Uniformed Services 
Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994.''
    Today there are members of the National Guard and Reserve, including 
Coast Guard Reservists, on active duty supporting operational missions. 
As their Commander in Chief, it is

timely for me to sign a bill that will clarify and strengthen their 
right to return to the civilian positions they held before going on 
active duty without any loss of seniority, status, or pay.
    The ``Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 
1994'' revises, improves, and clarifies the existing veterans 
reemployment rights statute, which was first enacted in 1940. Since that 
time, a confusing and cumbersome patchwork of statutory amendments and 
judicial constructions have made the law difficult for employers to 
understand.
    Among other changes, H.R. 995 extends coverage for the first time to 
the Coast Guard and Public Health Service Reserve components. It also 
entitles service members to continued health insurance coverage under 
their employer's plan for up to 18 months of military leave and makes 
explicit the rights of reemployed service members under their pension 
plans.
    My Administration is committed to enforcing the reemployment rights 
of service members. This Act is key to the achievement of that goal.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
October 13, 1994.

Note: H.R. 995, approved October 13, was assigned Public Law No. 103-
353.
