Statement on Senate Action on Food Safety Legislation
July 16, 1998

    I welcome today's 66-33 vote to restore much needed funds to our 
food safety programs. Food safety should not be about politics; instead 
it must be about protecting our families and children. Today, the Senate 
put Americans first and partisanship last. With this money we will be 
able to improve safety inspections of foods, better educate the public 
on how to handle food safely, improve research, and aid the effort to 
track food borne outbreaks such as salmonella and E. coli. We must 
continue to work together in the coming months on this issue and on the 
many other issues which the American people care about. The American 
people want action, not political wrangling.
