Message on the Observance of Rosh Hashana, 1997
September 30, 1997

    Warmest greetings to everyone celebrating Rosh Hashana.
    Throughout the centuries, the shofar has sounded on this day to 
herald the beginning of the High Holy Days and the start of a new year. 
It is a time for both joy and reflection--joy in the promise of another 
year in which to live and work, reflection on how to grow closer to God 
and family. It is also an opportunity to look back on our failures and 
shortcomings during the past year; not to dwell on them with bitterness 
and regret, but to learn from our mistakes so that the new year will be 
sweetened by the gifts of wisdom and hope.
    As Jews across America and around the world gather to reaffirm their 
faith in God and their love of family and community, Hillary and I 
extend best wishes that the coming year will be blessed with great 
abundance, true peace, and lasting joy.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
September 30.
