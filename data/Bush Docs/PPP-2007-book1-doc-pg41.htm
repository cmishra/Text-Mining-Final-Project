Telephone Remarks to the March for Life
January 22, 2007

    Yes, Nellie,<Gray, Nellie J.<ls-thn-eq> thank you. Thank you very 
much, Nellie. And I want to thank everybody there for taking part in 
today's March for Life. I appreciate so very much the devotion to such 
an honorable cause, and the good work everyone is doing to defend life.
    And, Nellie,<Gray, Nellie J.<ls-thn-eq> it's good to hear your voice 
again, and I thank you very much for giving me a chance to visit with 
you and the crowd that is assembled there on The Mall.
    It is important for all Americans to remember that our Declaration 
of Independence states that every person has the right to life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. It also states that these rights come from 
our Creator and that governments are formed to secure these rights for 
all their citizens. And we believe every human life has value. And we 
pray for the day when every child is welcome in life and protected into 
law.
    Nellie,<Gray, Nellie J.<ls-thn-eq> I want to thank you very much and 
the Members of Congress there who have worked hard to make progress 
toward this goal over the last 6 years. I want the folks assembled there 
to know that we're making progress. We promoted adoption, support 
parental notification laws, ended Federal funding for abortions 
overseas, and are funding crisis pregnancy programs.
    I had the privilege of signing legislation that extends legal 
protection to children who are born despite abortion attempts, allows 
prosecutors to charge those who harm or kill a pregnant woman with 
harming or killing her unborn child as well. I signed into law a ban on 
the cruel practice of partial-birth abortions, and we will vigorously 
defend that law in the courts.
    Nellie,<Gray, Nellie J.<ls-thn-eq> what I'm saying is, is that we're 
building a culture of life here. And I want to thank you and everybody 
assembled for helping.
    We are a caring nation, and our values should also guide us on how 
we harness the gifts of science. New medical breakthroughs bring the 
hope of cures for terrible diseases and treatments that can improve the 
lives of millions. Our challenge is to make sure that science serves the 
cause of humanity instead of the other way around.
    Last summer I vetoed a bill that would support the taking of 
innocent life in the hope of finding medical benefits for others, and I 
have made it clear to the Congress, we must pursue medical advances in 
the name of life, not at the expense of it.
    As we move forward, we've all got to remember that a true culture of 
life cannot be built by changing laws alone. We've all got to work hard 
to change hearts. We will find areas where we can agree and, at the same 
time, work to persuade more of our fellow citizens to join this great 
cause. The sanctity of life is written in the hearts of all men and 
women. And so I say: Go forth with confidence that a cause rooted in 
human dignity and appealing to the best instincts of our citizens cannot 
fail.
    Again, Nellie,<Gray, Nellie J.<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much. I 
appreciate your dedication to this important cause. I send my thanks to 
all there on The Mall. I ask for God's blessings on your work and that 
God continue to bless our country.
    Thank you.
