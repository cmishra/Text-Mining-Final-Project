Statement on the Crash of Swissair Flight 111
September 3, 1998

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the fatal crash of 
Swissair Flight 111 off Halifax, Nova Scotia, last night. We join the 
American people in extending our deepest sympathies to the families of 
the passengers and crewmembers aboard the aircraft.
    I want to thank the Canadian Government and people for the 
extraordinary way in which they responded to this tragedy. Hundreds of 
people, including many volunteers, searched through the night. The 
United States will continue to do everything we can to assist the 
Canadian and Swiss authorities in the search for survivors and to 
determine the cause of the accident. Members of the National 
Transportation Safety Board are on the scene of the crash, and we have 
offered support from our Navy, the Coast Guard, and other Federal 
agencies.
    I ask that the American people remember in their prayers the 
families who lost loved ones on that flight.
