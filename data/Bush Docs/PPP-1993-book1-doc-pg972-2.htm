Nomination for Posts at the Peace Corps
July 1, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate former Peace 
Corps volunteer Carol Bellamy, an attorney and former New York State 
Senator and president of the New York City Council, as Director of the 
Peace Corps. The President also approved attorney Brian Sexton as Peace 
Corps General Counsel.
    ``Throughout her career, Carol Bellamy has achieved success in both 
the corporate world and in her own initiatives to improve the lives of 
those less fortunate,'' the President said. ``I am confident she will 
use her experience in both of those areas to fulfill the important 
mission of the Peace Corps.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
