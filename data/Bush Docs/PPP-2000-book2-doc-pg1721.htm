Statement on the United Airlines Labor Agreement
August 27, 2000

    I am pleased that United Airlines and its pilots have reached an 
agreement at the bargaining table. I commend union and management for 
working together to resolve their differences in a way that will benefit 
the traveling public. I am also encouraged that over the last week the 
aviation industry met with Secretary Slater<Slater, Rodney E.> 
and pledged to work with my administration to address the service 
related issues and the long-term outlook for quality customer service.
