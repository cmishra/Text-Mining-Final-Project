Remarks on Receiving the Report of the National Commission on Terrorist 
Attacks Upon the United States
July 22, 2004

    The President. It's been my honor to welcome Chairman Kean,<Kean, 
Thomas H.<ls-thn-eq> Vice Chairman Hamilton<Hamilton, Lee H.<ls-thn-eq> 
to the Oval Office. We just had a good discussion about the 9/11 
Commission Report. I want to thank these two gentlemen for serving their 
country so well and so admirably. They've done a really good job of 
learning about our country, learning about what went wrong prior to 
September the 11th, and making very solid, sound recommendations about 
how to move forward. I assured them that where Government needs to act, 
we will.
    I want to thank the Commission members as well. These people worked 
really hard, long hours. They took time out of their private lives to 
serve America and have left their mark in a very constructive and 
positive way.
    These two<Kean, Thomas H.<ls-thn-eq> men<Hamilton, Lee H.<ls-thn-eq> 
bring a commonsense approach to how to move forward. They recognize what 
I recognize and America recognizes, that there's still a threat and that 
we in Government have an obligation to do everything in our power to 
safeguard the American people. And the report that they are about to 
present to me puts out some very constructive recommendations. And I 
look forward to studying their recommendations and look forward to 
working with responsible parties within my administration to move 
forward on those recommendations.
    As well, we look forward to working with the Congress on the 
implementation of ways to do our duty. And the most important duty we 
have is the security of our fellow countrymen.
    So, thank you, men, for your service. I'm proud you're here. You did 
a wonderful job.
    Commission Chairman Thomas H. Kean.<Kean, Thomas H.<ls-thn-eq> Mr. 
President, we'd like to present you a copy of our report. I thank you 
very much for giving me the honor of serving. I thank you also on behalf 
of the Commission for unprecedented access to documents and cooperation 
from your administration. We were able to see things that no commission 
or no Member of Congress has ever seen in doing our work. And we thank 
you for allowing us to do that.
    The President. Thank you, Tom.<Kean, Thomas H.<ls-thn-eq> Good job. 
Thanks, Lee.<Hamilton, Lee H.<ls-thn-eq> I appreciate you. Thank you 
all.

Note: The President spoke at 9:33 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House.
