Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
September 11, 2007

    I thank the leadership of the Congress for joining us here to 
discuss the testimonies delivered by General Petraeus<Petraeus, David 
H.<ls-thn-eq> and Ambassador Crocker.<Crocker, Ryan C.<ls-thn-eq> For 
some, this isn't the first moment they've been in the White House today, 
and I want to thank the leaders for joining Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
and me and the Vice President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> and his wife 
Lynne<Cheney, Lynne A.V.<ls-thn-eq> as we commemorated the--a day that 
really helped--or it did define our Nation, which is 
9/11/2001. We also had a church service earlier, and I thank 
particularly the Speaker<Pelosi, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> and the leader<Reid, 
Harry<ls-thn-eq> for being there as well.
    Secondly, all of us around this table are saddened by the loss of 
Congressman Paul Gillmor. Congressman Blunt<Blunt, Roy<ls-thn-eq> has 
just come from his memorial service. All of us offer our prayers to the 
Gillmor family during this difficult time.
    And finally, I've asked the leadership to come and share their 
thoughts about Iraq. As I mentioned, we've had a series of hearings 
where our commander on the ground<Petraeus, David H.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Ambassador<Crocker, Ryan C.<ls-thn-eq> in Iraq have talked about a way 
forward. I think it's very important before I make up my mind that I 
consult with the leaders of the House and the Senate. I thank the 
Members for coming and giving me their honest appraisal of whether they 
think we can find common ground or not and how they think we ought to 
proceed.
    So thank you for coming; appreciate you being here.

Note: The President spoke at 3 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Gen. David H. Petraeus, USA, 
commanding general, Multi-National Force--Iraq.
