Statement on Campaign Finance Reform Legislation
February 24, 1998

    Today a clear, bipartisan majority of the Senate voted for campaign 
finance reform. Now, only the obstruction of a minority stands in the 
way of a law that would strengthen our democracy. The opponents of 
reform are seeking to block this measure with partisan, unacceptable 
amendments, even an amendment to block the Federal Communications 
Commission from providing free air time to candidates. Let's be clear: A 
vote for these amendments is a vote for soft money, unregulated campaign 
contributions, and backdoor campaign spending. And that vote would be 
very difficult to explain to the American people.
