Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Renewal of 
Normal Trade Relations Status for Vietnam
June 1, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    I hereby transmit a report including my reasons for determining that 
continuation of the waiver currently in effect for Vietnam under 
subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), 
will substantially promote the objectives of section 402 of the Act.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The related memorandum of June 1 is listed in Appendix D at the 
end of this volume.
