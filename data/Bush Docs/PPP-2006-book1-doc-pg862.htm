Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Port Security 
Legislation
May 4, 2006

    I am pleased that the House of Representatives today passed a bill 
to enhance the security of our Nation's ports. I look forward to working 
with Congress on passage of legislation that will make our people safer 
and facilitate trade.
