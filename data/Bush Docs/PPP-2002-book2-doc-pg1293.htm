Statement on House of Representatives Action on Corporate Accountability 
Legislation
July 25, 2002

    I commend the House of Representatives for its overwhelming 
bipartisan passage of reforms to hold corporate America accountable. 
This legislation will protect investors, crack down on fraud and 
wrongdoing, and provide tough oversight of the accounting industry. 
Leaders in Congress heeded the call to put the interests of investors 
and employees first. I look forward to prompt action by the Senate so 
that I can sign this important legislation into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 3763, the ``Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
2002.''
