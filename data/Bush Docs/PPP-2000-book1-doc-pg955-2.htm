Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process
May 17, 2000

    Monday, May 22, marks the second anniversary of the referenda in 
which the voters of Ireland and Northern Ireland overwhelmingly endorsed 
the Good Friday accord. Since then, Northern Ireland has made great 
strides toward becoming a peaceful society, following three decades of 
violence. Today, we are on the threshold of a major achievement--a 
lasting political arrangement that will allow the people of Northern 
Ireland and their representatives to decide their future for themselves 
by exclusively peaceful means, on the basis of consent. This is a chance 
to lock in the unprecedented progress that has been attained and propel 
the process forward. It is an opportunity that must not be lost. I urge 
the parties to lift their sights, seize the possibilities that are 
within their grasp, and take the steps necessary to advance the cause of 
peace.
