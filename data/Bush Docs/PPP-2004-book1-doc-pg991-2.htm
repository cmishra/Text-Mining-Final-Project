Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Worker Reemployment 
Accounts Legislation
June 4, 2004

    I commend the House for passing the ``Worker Reemployment Accounts 
Act,'' which establishes a pilot program for Personal Reemployment 
Accounts.
    Personal Reemployment Accounts are an important reform in Federal 
job training, because workers decide how to use the funds to maximize 
their likelihood of securing a job. A Personal Reemployment Account 
gives unemployed Americans additional choices and flexibility to help 
them return to work more quickly. They can use funds from their account 
to pay for what they need most to help find a job--special training, 
childcare, transportation, relocation assistance, or a combination of 
these. Finally, there is a reemployment bonus that lets workers who 
return

to work quickly keep any leftover funds from their account.
    These innovative accounts that I proposed last year put 
decisionmaking and resources directly in the hands of individuals who 
need the most help getting back to work. I urge the Senate to pass this 
important legislation so that we can help every American who wants to 
work find a job.
