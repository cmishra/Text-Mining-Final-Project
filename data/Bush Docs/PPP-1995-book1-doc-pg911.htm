Message to the Congress Transmitting the Latvia-United States
Fishery Agreement
June 20, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement 
Between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Republic of Latvia Extending the Agreement of April 8, 
1993, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States. The 
Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at Riga on March 
28, 1995, and April 4, 1995, extends the 1993 Agreement to December 31, 
1997.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Latvia, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

June 20, 1995.
