    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I and the entire Bush family are 
saddened by Lloyd Bentsen's death. Lloyd Bentsen served in the House of 
Representatives for 6 years, and he represented the people of Texas in 
the United States Senate for 22 years. During his time in Congress, he 
was known for his integrity and for seeking bipartisan solutions to 
issues facing our Nation. He later became Secretary of the Treasury in 
President Clinton's<Clinton, William J.<ls-thn-eq> administration.
    As a young man, Lloyd Bentsen served our country in battle in the 
United States Army Air Forces, and he was awarded the Distinguished 
Flying Cross. In 1999, in recognition of his lifetime of service to the 
United States, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 
Nation's highest civil award. Lloyd Bentsen was a man of great honor and 
distinction. We send our condolences and prayers to B.A.<Bentsen, Beryl 
A.<ls-thn-eq> and the Bentsen family.

Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr.
