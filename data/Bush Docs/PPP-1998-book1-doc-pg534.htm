Statement on the United States-France Civil Aviation Agreement
April 8, 1998

    I am pleased that the United States has reached an agreement with 
France significantly increasing air service between our countries. The 
U.S.-France aviation market is our third largest in Europe. Until today, 
it was also our largest aviation market not governed by a bilateral 
agreement. This agreement will eliminate all restrictions on airline 
operations between the United States and France in 5 years. It will 
allow many more flights between our two countries and give U.S. airlines 
extensive new rights that will enhance their capacity to serve this 
market. This increased competition means more choice for American 
business travelers and tourists alike.
    This agreement continues my efforts to open the world's markets in 
areas where American companies are most competitive. We have already 
concluded important aviation agreements with Japan, Germany, Canada, and 
many other nations. These agreements are part of our strategy to replace 
restrictions with opportunities and move international aviation into a 
21st century where consumers, not governments, determine how passenger 
and cargo needs are served.
    I want to thank Secretaries Albright<Albright, Madeleine 
K.<ls-thn-eq> and <Slater, Rodney E.<ls-thn-eq>Slater and the 
negotiators at the Departments of State and Transportation for their 
sustained efforts in reaching this agreement.
