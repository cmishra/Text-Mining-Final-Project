Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to the Stabilization of Iraq
May 20, 2008

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication. This notice 
states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 of 
May 22, 2003, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps 
taken in Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, Executive Order 13350 
of July 29, 2004, Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, and 
Executive Order 13438 of July 17, 2007, is to continue in effect beyond 
May 22, 2008.
    Obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and 
maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of 
political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States. Accordingly, I have

determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency with 
respect to this threat and maintain in force the measures taken in 
response to this threat.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 May 20, 2008.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
