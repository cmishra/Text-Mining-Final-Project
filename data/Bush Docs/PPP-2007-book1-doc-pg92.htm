Statement on Senate Passage of Minimum Wage and Tax Relief Legislation
February 1, 2007

    Today the Senate has passed significant legislation that will 
benefit America's workers and small businesses. By working in a 
bipartisan way to match a minimum wage increase with tax relief for 
small businesses, the Senate has taken a step toward helping maintain a 
strong and dynamic labor market and promoting continued economic growth. 
I strongly encourage the House to support this combined minimum wage 
increase and small-business tax relief.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 2.
