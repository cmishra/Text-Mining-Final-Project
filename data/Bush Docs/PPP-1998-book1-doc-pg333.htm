Statement on House of Representatives Action on Funding for the 
International Monetary Fund
March 5, 1998

    I want to congratulate members of both parties in the House Banking 
Committee who have voted to give the International Monetary Fund the 
resources it needs to deal with the risks to financial stability around 
the world. This bipartisan legislation will help ensure that the IMF has 
the funds it needs to protect American jobs and exports.

    The American economy continues to demonstrate its remarkable 
strength, and we must do everything we can to keep it on a path of 
steady growth. That is why we will work to build broad bipartisan 
support for this legislation as it moves forward in Congress. It is 
vital that the Congress move as quickly as possible to support full 
funding for the IMF.
