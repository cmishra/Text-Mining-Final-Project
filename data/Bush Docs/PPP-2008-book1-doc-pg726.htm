Statement on the Presidential Election in Lebanon
May 25, 2008

    I congratulate Michel Sleiman<Sleiman, Michel<ls-thn-eq> on his 
election as President of Lebanon. I am confident that Lebanon has chosen 
a leader committed to protecting its sovereignty, extending the 
Government's authority over all of Lebanon, and upholding Lebanon's 
international obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions, 
including 1559, 1701, and 1757.
    I am hopeful that the Doha agreement, which paved the way for this 
election, will usher in an era of political reconciliation to the 
benefit of all Lebanese. We look forward to working with President 
Sleiman<Sleiman, Michel<ls-thn-eq> in pursuit of our common values of 
freedom and independence.
