Remarks at Stribling Packaging, Inc., in Rogers, Arkansas
October 15, 2007

    The President. One of the reasons I've stopped by this facility here 
in Arkansas is to remind people that small business is the backbone of 
our economy. These good folks are making a living; more importantly, 
they're providing labor for people here in this facility. And that's 
what we want. We want people working in America. We've gone through now 
49 consecutive months of uninterrupted job growth; that's a record for 
the United States.
    And one of the reasons why is our small-business owners are working 
hard. And another reason why is we've got people in the United States 
Congress who understand the role of government, and that is not to get 
in the way of business, but it's to create an environment where 
businesses flourish. And when people are buying this man's<Stribling, 
Bill<ls-thn-eq> boxes, it also means they're buying product at the 
retail level.
    And so I want to thank you for giving me a chance to come by.
    Bill Stribling.<Stribling, Bill<ls-thn-eq> Absolutely.
    The President. And appreciate the opportunity to meet your workers. 
As I was walking around, I was shaking the workers' hands. He<Stribling, 
Bill<ls-thn-eq> said, ``That's good that you're meeting them. After all, 
they're the reason this business is growing.'' And I appreciate a man 
who understands that. Thanks for your hospitality.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:44 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Bill Stribling, president, Stribling Packaging, Inc.
