Statement on the Death of Senator Jesse Helms<Helms, Jesse<ls-thn-eq>
July 4, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the 
passing of our good friend and a great American, Senator Jesse Helms. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Dot<Helms, Dorothy J. 
``Dot''<ls-thn-eq> and all the members of the Helms family.
    Throughout his long public career, Senator Jesse Helms was a 
tireless advocate for the people of North Carolina, a stalwart defender 
of limited government and free enterprise, a fearless defender of a 
culture of life, and an unwavering champion of those struggling for 
liberty. Under his leadership, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
was a powerful force for freedom. And today, from Central America to 
Central Europe and beyond, people remember, in the dark days when the 
forces of tyranny seemed on the rise, Jesse Helms took their side.
    Jesse Helms was a kind, decent, and humble man and a passionate 
defender of what he called ``the miracle of America.'' So it is fitting 
that this great patriot left us on the Fourth of July. He was once asked 
if he had any ambitions beyond the United States Senate. He replied, 
``The only thing I am running for is the Kingdom of Heaven.'' Today 
Jesse Helms has finished the race, and we pray he finds comfort in the 
arms of the loving God he strove to serve throughout his life.
