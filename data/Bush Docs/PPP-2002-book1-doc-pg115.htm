Exchange With Reporters in Portland, Maine
January 25, 2002

Situation in the Middle East

    Q. Mr. President, are you consider cutting off ties to Yasser 
Arafat,<Arafat, Yasser> sir?
    The President. I am disappointed in Yasser Arafat. He must make a 
full effort to rout out terror in the Middle East. In order for there to 
be peace, we've got to rout out terror. And ordering up weapons that 
were intercepted on a boat headed toward--headed for that part of the 
world is not part of fighting terror; that's enhancing terror. And 
obviously, we're very disappointed.
    Q. We're told that you thought his explanation was insulting, sir.
    The President. I never said that.
    Thank you all.

Note: The exchange began at 12:25 p.m. while touring the U.S. Coast 
Guard Cutter Tahoma at the International Marine Terminal. In his 
remarks, the President referred to Chairman Yasser Arafat of the 
Palestinian Authority. A tape was not available for verification of the 
content of this exchange.
