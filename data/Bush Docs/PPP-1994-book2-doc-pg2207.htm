Statement on the Attacks on Women's Clinics in Boston, Massachusetts
December 30, 1994

    I strongly condemn the meaningless violence which abruptly ended the 
lives of two women and wounded five others in Massachusetts today.
    Violence has no place in America. No matter where we stand on the 
issue of abortion, all Americans must stand together in condemning this 
tragic and brutal act. Nine years ago, President Reagan, a staunch foe 
of abortion, called for ``a complete rejection of violence as a means of 
settling this issue.'' We would do well to heed those words today.
    We must protect the safety and freedom of all our citizens. I am 
strongly committed to ending this form of domestic terrorism. I have 
called for a thorough investigation into this attack, and Attorney 
General Reno and FBI Director Freeh have already begun that task. I urge 
local officials to work closely with the Federal law enforcement 
community.
    Hillary and I extend our deepest sympathy to the friends and 
families of those who were murdered. I speak for all Americans in 
expressing my hope for a full and complete recovery for those who were 
wounded.
