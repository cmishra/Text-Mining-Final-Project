Statement on Senate Passage of Energy Legislation
June 28, 2005

    The American people expect their leaders to work together to help 
provide economic and energy security. I applaud the Senate for working 
in a bipartisan way to pass comprehensive energy legislation consistent 
with what I proposed in 2001. This bill will help our economic growth by 
addressing the root causes of high energy prices and reducing our 
dependence on foreign sources of energy. It will encourage the use of 
technology to improve energy conservation and efficiency, help increase 
domestic energy supplies, support alternative and renewable sources, and 
enhance reliability. I urge the House and Senate to resolve their 
differences quickly and get a good bill to my desk before the August 
recess.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 6.
