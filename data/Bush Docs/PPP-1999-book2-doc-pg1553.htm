Statement on Proposed Patients' Bill of Rights Legislation
September 17, 1999

    I am pleased that the House of Representatives will have an 
opportunity in just a few weeks to vote on a strong, enforceable 
Patients' Bill of Rights. This will, at long last, give Members of 
Congress an opportunity to put patients' interests ahead of the special 
interests.
    A bipartisan majority of the House has already expressed support for 
the Norwood-Dingell proposal, a plan that would provide for an 
enforceable set of meaningful patient protections that would be extended 
to all Americans in all health plans. I am confident that the Norwood-
Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights will be adopted, if the House 
leadership permits a fair process for debating and voting on this 
important issue.
