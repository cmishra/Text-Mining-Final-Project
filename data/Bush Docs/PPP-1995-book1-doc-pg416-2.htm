Statement on Senate Action To Reject a Regulatory Moratorium
March 29, 1995

    I am deeply committed to regulatory reform that cuts redtape without 
undercutting the health and safety of the American people. Giving the 
Congress 45 days to consider regulations before they take effect would 
let lawmakers focus on the specifics of these issues and address real 
problems as they come up, without delaying necessary public protections. 
This approach, not the blunt instrument of a moratorium, is the right 
way to reform regulation. It's common sense.
