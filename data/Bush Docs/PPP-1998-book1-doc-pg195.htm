Statement on the Accident Involving United States Aircraft in the 
Persian Gulf
February 7, 1998

    Defending America's interests is difficult, dangerous work--and our 
men and women in uniform bear that burden every day. Nowhere is their 
service more important than in the Persian Gulf.
    I was saddened to learn that one of our Marine Corps F/A-18 pilots, 
Lieutenant Colonel Henry G. Van Winkle II,<Van Winkle, Henry G., 
II<ls-thn-eq> lost his life yesterday in the skies over the Persian 
Gulf. Lieutenant Colonel Van Winkle was there as part of America's 
commitment to back up our determined diplomacy with force as we work to 
prevent Saddam Hussein<Hussein, Saddam<ls-thn-eq> from threatening the 
world with weapons of mass destruction.

    Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones--and with all our 
men and women in uniform around the world as they serve and sacrifice 
every day to keep Americans safe and America strong.
