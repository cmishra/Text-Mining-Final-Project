Statement on Congressional Action on Bioterrorism Defense Legislation
December 12, 2001

    I commend Congressmen Tauzin<Tauzin, W.J.``Billy''> and 
Dingell<Dingell, John D.> for successfully passing bipartisan 
legislation that will help meet our immediate bioterrorism defense 
needs. Their legislation includes many of my priorities, including 
proposals to expand the pharmaceutical stockpile, increase our supply of 
smallpox vaccines, strengthen State and local preparedness, and improve 
the safety of our food supply.
    I look forward to working closely with Congressmen Tauzin<Tauzin, 
W.J. ``Billy''> and Dingell,<Dingell, John D.> as 
well as Senators Kennedy,<Kennedy, Edward M.> Gregg,<Gregg, 
Judd> and Frist,<Frist, Bill> to quickly reach a 
bipartisan consensus on this important legislation.
