Videotaped Remarks for the Memorial Service in Jonesboro, Arkansas
March 29, 1998

    Hillary and I wish we could be with you all as you remember and give 
thanks for the lives of Natalie Brooks,<Brooks, Natalie<ls-thn-eq> Paige 
Ann Herring,<Herring, Paige Ann<ls-thn-eq> Stephanie Johnson,<Johnson, 
Stephanie<ls-thn-eq> Britthney Varner,<Varner, Britthney<ls-thn-eq> and 
Shannon Wright.<Wright, Shannon<ls-thn-eq>
    Our prayers have been with their families and with all of you over 
these last few days. Every one of them made Jonesboro a better place. 
Every one of them had much to live for and much still to give. For now, 
you must all be thankful for the cherished memories you have.
    Like all of you, I do not understand what dark force could have 
driven young people to do this terrible thing. As President, I have seen 
many children killed by political fanatics, but in some ways, this is 
even harder to grasp. For now, all we can do is to pray for peace and

healing for their families and for Jonesboro. And, indeed, we should 
pray for the families of the<Johnson, Mitchell<ls-thn-eq> two young 
suspects,<Golden, Andrew<ls-thn-eq> for their suffering, too, must be 
grievous.
    Saint Paul reminds us that we all see things in this life through a 
dark glass, that we only partly understand what is happening to us. But 
one day, face to face with God, we will see all things, even as He sees 
us.
    For four fine young girls and an outstanding teacher, that day has 
come. May God bless them, their families, and all of you.

Note: These remarks were videotaped in the afternoon on March 28 in 
Johannesburg, South Africa, for the memorial service held on March 31 in 
Jonesboro, AR. They were released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on March 29. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
these remarks.
