Message to the Senate Transmitting the Mexico-United States Taxation 
Convention
May 20, 1993

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of the United Mexican States for the Avoidance of 
Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to 
Taxes on Income, together with a related Protocol, signed at Washington 
on September 18, 1992. Also transmitted for the information of the 
Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the 
Convention.

[[Page 711]]

    The income tax Convention, the first between the two countries, is 
intended to reduce the distortions (double taxation or excessive 
taxation) that can arise when two countries tax the same income, thereby 
enabling United States firms to compete on a more equitable basis in 
Mexico and enhancing the attractiveness of the United States to Mexican 
investors. The Convention is generally based on the Model Treaty of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and recent income 
tax conventions of both parties.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Convention and related Protocol and give its advice and consent 
to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
May 20, 1993.
