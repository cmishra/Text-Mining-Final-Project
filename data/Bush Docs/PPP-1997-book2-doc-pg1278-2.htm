Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Iran
September 30, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue beyond the anniversary date. 
In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, 
stating that the Iran emergency declared in 1979 is to continue in 
effect beyond November 14,

1997, to the Federal Register for publication. Similar notices have been 
sent annually to the Congress and the Federal Register since November 
12, 1980. The most recent notice appeared in the Federal Register on 
October 31, 1996. This emergency is separate from that declared with 
respect to Iran on March 15, 1995, in Executive Order 12957.
    The crisis between the United States and Iran that began in 1979 has 
not been fully resolved. The international tribunal established to 
adjudicate claims of the United States and U.S. nationals against Iran 
and of the Iranian government and Iranian nationals against the United 
States continues to function, and normalization of commercial and 
diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran has not been 
achieved. In these circumstances, I have determined that it is necessary 
to maintain in force the broad authorities that are in place by virtue 
of the November 14, 1979, declaration of emergency and that are needed 
in the process of implementing the January 1981 agreements with Iran.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

September 30, 1997.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
