Statement on Assistance to Small Business Exporters and Dislocated 
Workers
October 6, 2000

    I am pleased to sign an Executive order today creating a small 
business exports task force to help small businesses, especially those 
in underserved communities, participate fully in the benefits of the new 
trading arrangements Congress approved this year with China, Africa, and 
the Caribbean Basin. This order will also expand the Federal 
Government's outreach to workers and communities eligible for 
dislocated-worker assistance, helping them to learn about and take 
advantage of these benefits more rapidly. I thank Representative Sheila 
Jackson Lee<Jackson Lee, Sheila> for working so closely with 
my administration in developing this Executive order and for championing 
efforts to translate our expanding trade and dynamic, new economy into 
opportunities for small businesses and workers all across America.

Note: The Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
