Statement on Signing an Executive Order Blocking Property of Additional 
Persons Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Zimbabwe
July 25, 2008

    Today I have signed a new Executive order that expands our sanctions 
against the illegitimate Government of Zimbabwe. The new Executive order 
significantly enhances our ability to designate individuals in and 
entities connected to the Mugabe<Mugabe, Robert<ls-thn-eq> regime. Under 
the new Executive order, the Treasury Department will today designate 
several of these Government-controlled entities.
    This action is a direct result of the Mugabe<Mugabe, 
Robert<ls-thn-eq> regime's continued politically motivated violence, 
disregarding calls from the Southern African Development Community, the 
African Union, and the United Nations to halt the attacks. The regime 
has also continued its ban against NGO activities that would provide 
assistance to the suffering and vulnerable people of Zimbabwe. No regime 
should ignore the will of its own people and calls from the 
international community without consequences.
    Should ongoing talks in South Africa between Mugabe's<Mugabe, 
Robert<ls-thn-eq> regime and the Movement of Democratic Change result in 
a new government that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people, the 
United States stands ready to provide a substantial assistance package, 
development aid, and normalization with international financial 
institutions.
    In the meantime, I am reaffirming my commitment to support the 
suffering people of Zimbabwe, authorizing the use of up to $2.5 million 
from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance

[[Page 1052]]

Fund to assist Zimbabwean refugees and asylum seekers who have been 
displaced due to the ongoing violence in their country. We will also 
continue our efforts to provide food and health assistance as part of 
our commitment to help the people of Zimbabwe in their time of greatest 
need.

Note: The statement referred to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. The 
Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
