Statement on the Executive Order on Environmental Justice
February 11, 1994

    All Americans have a right to be protected from pollution--not just 
those who can afford to live in the cleanest, safest communities. Today 
we direct Federal agencies to make environmental justice a part of all 
that they do.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the signing of the Executive order, which is listed in Appendix D at the 
end of this volume.
