Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration

submission covered events from August 1, 2002, through September 30, 
2002. Particularly significant during this period was U.N. Secretary-
General Annan's submission on November 11 to Greek Cypriot leader 
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash of a proposed 
basis for a Cyprus agreement.
    As in past reporting periods, U.S. officials provided diplomatic 
support to the process, including Secretary of State Powell,<Powell, 
Colin L.> National Security Advisor Rice,<Rice, 
Condoleezza> Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. 
Weston,<Weston, Thomas G.> and Ambassador to Cyprus Michael 
Klosson.<Klosson, Michael> The United States remains committed 
to the U.N. effort to find a just and lasting settlement to the Cyprus 
problem.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, and Richard G. Lugar, chairman, Senate Committee on
