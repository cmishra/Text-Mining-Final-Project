Letter to Television Networks on Use of Program Violence Warnings
June 30, 1993

Dear Howard:
    I applaud the action taken today by CBS and by the other major 
broadcast networks to begin addressing the problem of violence on 
television. Millions of parents are rightly concerned that their 
children are exposed to far too many graphic pictures of murder and 
mayhem. The announcement of voluntary violence warnings is an important, 
commendable first step in dealing with this crucial issue.
    For the health of our society and the American family, we must 
continue to find ways to limit the excessive portrayal of violence in 
our television programming. In the past, the television industry has 
responded to public concerns and has dealt in a responsible manner with 
issues such as drug use, alcohol, and smoking. I encourage the broadcast 
industry, the creators and producers, as well as the advertisers who 
support network programming, to take full responsibility in limiting the 
amount of televised violence.
    Again, I commend the networks for this initial effort and encourage 
you to continue to find ways to make your programming suitable for the 
children and youth of this nation.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This letter was sent to Howard Stringer, president, CBS Broadcast 
Group. Similar letters were sent to Warren Littlefield, president, NBC 
Entertainment; George Vradenburg, executive vice president, Fox 
Television; Thomas S. Murphy, chairman of the board, Capital Cities-ABC;

System.
