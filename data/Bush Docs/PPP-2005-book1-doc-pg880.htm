Statement on Senate Confirmation of Priscilla R. Owen<Owen, Priscilla 
Richman<ls-thn-eq> as a United States Court of Appeals Judge for the 
Fifth Circuit
May 25, 2005

    I applaud the Senate for voting to confirm Justice Priscilla Owen. 
She has served with distinction on the Supreme Court of Texas, has 
demonstrated that she strictly interprets the law, and brings a wealth 
of experience and expertise to the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Fifth Circuit. I urge the Senate to build on this progress and 
provide my judicial nominees the up-or-down votes they deserve.
