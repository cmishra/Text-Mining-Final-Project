Exchange With Reporters on Somalia
June 17, 1993

    Q. Mr. President, are you satisfied with the level of military 
activity in Somalia, or do we need to add the Marines that are heading 
that way?
    The President. Well, let me just say that for now I think I should 
say that I've been fully briefed on what has happened to date. I'm 
encouraged, and I may have more to say about it this evening.

Note: The exchange began at 4:40 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House, prior to a meeting with White House fellows. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of this exchange.
