Message to the Congress Transmitting the Poland-United States Fisheries 
Agreement
February 5, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an 
Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Republic of Poland extending the Agreement of August 
1, 1985, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, with 
annexes and agreed minutes, as amended and extended (the 1985 
Agreement). The Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes at 
Warsaw on February 5 and August 25, 1997, extends the 1985 Agreement to 
December 31, 1999.

    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Poland, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 5, 1998.
