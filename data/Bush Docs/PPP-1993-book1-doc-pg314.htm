Nomination for Small Business Administrator
March 16, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate North 
Carolina businessman Erskine Bowles to head the Small Business 
Administration.
    ``Small business is the engine that runs the American economy. We 
need to give a hand up to the new businesses and traditional mom-and-pop 
stores that provide the jobs in our cities and small towns,'' the 
President said. ``Erskine Bowles will do an excellent job of making SBA 
a more efficient operation that works to strengthen the backbone of 
small business in this country.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
