Statement on Senate Action on Education Legislation
February 8, 1994

    I would like to congratulate the United States Senate today for 
moving toward a national framework for lifelong learning by passing both 
the ``Goals 2000 Act'' and the ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act'' on 
strong bipartisan votes. By approving these bills, the Senate gets an 
``A'' in education.
    Since my days as Governor, I have been committed to education reform 
based on world-class standards and accountability for results. Only if 
we demand more of our schools and students will we see expanded 
educational opportunity and nationwide excellence. From the time I 
helped draft the national education goals on behalf of the National 
Governors' Association, I looked forward to the day when the Federal 
Government would finally take the lead on education. Today's Senate 
action brings us closer to that day.
    In today's global economy, what you earn depends on what you learn. 
The Senate has now opened opportunity for our children during school and 
as they begin their careers. Goals 2000 will write the national 
education goals into law and will give States and local schools new 
tools to meet them. The school-to-work bill will significantly enhance 
our effort to create an effective apprenticeship system for those who 
don't go to college.
    These steps are vital not only for the education of our children but 
for the health of our economy as a whole. Our workers will only be able 
to cope with a world of rapid economic change if they are fully trained 
and equipped to compete. We will only master new technologies if this 
training continues throughout a lifetime. World-class education is an 
investment in a world-leading economy. By its action today, the U.S. 
Senate has moved us a step closer

to setting national standards that will challenge our students, 
encourage partnerships between parents, schools, and communities, and 
guarantee that our young people have the skills they need to compete in 
the global marketplace.
    I look forward to swift agreement between the House and Senate on 
these critical investments in our Nation's future.
