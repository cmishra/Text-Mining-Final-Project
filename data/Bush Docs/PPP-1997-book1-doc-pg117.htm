Remarks on the Death of Ambassador Pamela Harriman
February 5, 1997

    Hillary and I were very sad to learn that our good friend and 
America's outstanding Ambassador to France, Pamela Harriman, passed away 
just a few moments ago in Paris.
    She was an extraordinary United States Ambassador, representing our 
country as well as our Government to the people of France and to the 
Government, earning the trust of the leaders and the admiration of 
people. She was one of the most unusual and gifted people I ever met, 
with an extraordinary life, from her years growing up in Great Britain 
to being a part of what the British went through in World War II as the 
Prime Minister's daughter-in-law and then her remarkable life in America 
with Averell Harriman, with all the work she did as a force for 
political activism for the Democratic Party, and with the friends she 
had in both parties, in business, in labor, and in politics.
    Our country will miss her. We are deeply indebted to the work she 
did in France in maintaining our relationships with one of our oldest 
and closest allies. She was a source of judgment, an inspiration to me, 
a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we 
will miss her very, very much.
    I had a good talk this morning with her son, Winston Churchill, and 
our prayers are with him and the rest of her family and her legion of 
friends. She will be brought home to America later this week, and we'll 
have more announcements about her funeral later.

    America has lost a great public servant and another immigrant who 
became a great American.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:28 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House, prior to his departure for Augusta, GA.
