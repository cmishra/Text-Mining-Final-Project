Remarks at the Heart Truth Reception
February 11, 2008

    Thank you all. Welcome to the White House. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are glad you're here, and thanks for coming. I 
welcome members of my Cabinet. I particularly want to thank all the 
healers and compassionate folks who help with heart disease. The Vice 
President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> sends his best. [Laughter]
    All of us here are committed to America's heart health. I don't know 
if our fellow

citizens know this, but this is American Heart Month. And it's a good 
time to remember that an estimated 80 million people across the United 
States suffer from heart disease. The disease is the number-one killer 
of American men and women. Many women, however, do not even know they're 
at risk, and so they don't take simple steps that can protect their 
health.
    And that's where the Heart Truth Campaign comes in. Over the last 5 
years, I appreciate the fact that you all have spread the word, and you 
represent thousands across our country who are doing so as well. You've 
helped women reduce the factors for heart disease, and that's a noble 
calling, an important contribution to our country. Every February, you 
encourage women to wear the red dress, which I appreciate. And I do want 
to thank the fashion industry for stepping up and--[applause].
    And the results are measurable. Women's awareness has been raised; 
women's lives have been saved. Earlier this month, I was in Kansas City, 
and I met a woman named Joyce Cullen.<Cullen, Joyce<ls-thn-eq> In 2003, 
Joyce saw coverage of Laura's<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> visit to a Kansas 
City hospital. She just talked about the symptoms that--of heart disease 
in women. It was just a simple explanation of what people should be 
aware of. She woke up with those symptoms shortly after Laura's visit. 
She went to the hospital. Her life was saved, and she's now a part of 
Heart Truth. And that's the effort in which you're involved, simple acts 
that are spreading across the country and saving lives.
    My job today is not only to welcome you and to thank you but to 
introduce the Heart Truth's national ambassador.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
Laura is committed to the Heart Truth Campaign. She's a great First 
Lady, and she's always dear to my heart--the First Lady.

Note: The President spoke at 4:40 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also 
included the remarks of the First Lady. The related American Heart Month 
proclamation of February 1 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
