Remarks With Judge Priscilla R. Owen<Owen, Priscilla Richman<ls-thn-eq> 
on Senate Action To Allow Votes on Judicial Nominations
May 24, 2005

    The President. I'm proud to welcome Judge Priscilla Owen to the Oval 
Office, along with Leader Frist<Frist, Bill<ls-thn-eq> and my two 
buddies from the great State of Texas, Senator Hutchison<Hutchison, Kay 
Bailey<ls-thn-eq> and Senator Cornyn.<Cornyn, John<ls-thn-eq>
    Over 4 years ago, I put Judge Owen's name up to the Senate for 
confirmation to the Fifth Court of Appeals. Thanks to the good work of 
the leader, whose work cleared the way, Judge Owen is finally going to 
get an up-or-down vote on the

Senate floor. She is my friend, and more importantly, she's a great 
judge.
    I want to thank the Texas<Hutchison, Kay Bailey<ls-thn-eq> 
Senators<Cornyn, John<ls-thn-eq> who have been so strong standing beside 
Priscilla. There was never any doubt in the Senators' minds that 
Priscilla Owen is well-qualified to honorably serve on the Federal 
bench. And it's such a--it's a great day for our friend, to see our 
friend finally get a just due, after a long, long wait.
    So, welcome and congratulations. Perhaps you'd like to say 
something.
