Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Protection of Lawful 
Commerce in Arms Legislation
October 20, 2005

    I commend the House for passing the ``Protection of Lawful Commerce 
in Arms Act.'' Our laws should punish criminals who use guns to commit 
crimes, not law-abiding manufacturers of lawful products. This 
legislation will further our efforts to stem frivolous lawsuits, which 
cause a logjam in America's courts, harm America's small businesses, and 
benefit a handful of lawyers at the expense of victims and consumers. I 
look forward to signing this legislation into law.

Note: The statement referred to S. 397.
