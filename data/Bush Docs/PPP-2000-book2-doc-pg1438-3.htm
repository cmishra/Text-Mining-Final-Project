Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Iraq's 
Compliance With United Nations Security Council Resolutions
July 17, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1 as amended by Public Law 106-113) and 
as part of my effort to keep the Congress fully informed, I am reporting 
on the status of efforts to obtain Iraq's compliance with the 
resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council. I shall 
continue to keep the Congress informed about this important issue.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Strom Thurmond, President pro tempore of 
the Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on July 18.
