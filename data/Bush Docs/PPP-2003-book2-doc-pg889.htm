Statement on the Death of Celia Cruz<Cruz, Celia<ls-thn-eq>
July 17, 2003

    Celia Cruz was an international artist whose voice and talent 
entertained audiences around the world. Her success in the years 
following her departure from her beloved Cuba was a tribute to her 
perseverance, compassion, and love for life. Laura joins me in sending 
our thoughts and prayers to her family and friends.

transcript of this statement.
