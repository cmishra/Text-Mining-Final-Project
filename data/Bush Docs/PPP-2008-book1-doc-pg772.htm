Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments
June 9, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2009 
Budget requests for the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Homeland 
Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, Labor, 
Transportation, and the Treasury; as well as the Corps of Engineers, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Office of 
Personnel Management. These amendments will decrease by $3 million the 
overall discretionary budget authority in my FY 2009 Budget.

[[Page 773]]

    These amendments are necessary to correctly reflect policies 
proposed in my FY 2009 Budget. The details of these amendments are set 
forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
June 10.
