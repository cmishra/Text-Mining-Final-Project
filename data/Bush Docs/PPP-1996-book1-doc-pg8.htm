Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
January 4, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question. The previous submission covered progress through 
September 30, 1995. The current submission covers the period October 1, 
1995, through November 30, 1995.
    The focus of my Administration's activity during this reporting 
period was preparations for the December trip to Cyprus of my Special 
Emissary, Richard Beattie. Mr. Beattie's travel reflects my interest in 
intensifying United States Government efforts to achieve progress 
towards an intercommunal settlement. His ongoing work supports the U.N.-
led effort to attain lasting peace on the island. Consultations with the 
parties confirmed that security has not diminished as a key concern for 
both sides.

    With respect to Cyprus' European Union (EU) accession process, in 
discussions with European officials and others, my representatives 
continued to urge that the EU engage both communities regularly to 
explain what EU membership would mean for a federal Cyprus state. Such 
dialogue would encourage the parties to use the period before accession 
negotiations to establish a bizonal, bicommunal federation that could 
ultimately enter the EU.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
