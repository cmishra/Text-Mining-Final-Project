Statement on Congressional Passage of Energy Legislation
July 29, 2005

    I applaud the Congress for today's passage of an energy bill that 
will help secure our energy future and reduce our dependence on foreign 
sources of energy. The energy bill will increase conservation and 
efficiency, diversify our energy supply with alternative and renewable 
sources, expand domestic energy production in environmentally sensitive 
ways, and modernize our electricity infrastructure. Four years ago, I 
called for a national energy plan to address our Nation's energy needs 
for the 21st century. The bipartisan energy bill passed today will give 
America a comprehensive national energy strategy for the first time in 
more than a decade and is critically important to our long-term national 
and economic security. I look forward to signing it into law.
