Message to the Congress on the National Emergency Caused by Hurricane 
Katrina
September 8, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:
    I hereby report that I have exercised my statutory authority under 
section 6 of the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 276a-5, to suspend the 
provisions of sections 276a to 276a-5 of the Davis-Bacon Act in the 
event of a national emergency. I have found thatthe conditions caused by 
Hurricane Katrina constitute a ``national emergency'' within the meaning 
of section 6. I have, therefore, suspended the provisions of the Davis-
Bacon Act in designated areas in the States of Alabama, Florida, 
Louisiana, and Mississippi.

    This action is more fully set out in the enclosed proclamation that 
I have issued today.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 September 8, 2005.

Note: The proclamation of September 8 regarding the designated areas 
affected by Hurricane Katrina is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
