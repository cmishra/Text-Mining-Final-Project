Statement on the Death of Congressman George E. Brown, Jr.<Brown, George 
E., Jr.>
July 16, 1999

    I was greatly saddened to learn of the death of Congressman George 
Brown. When he last visited the White House, I noted that he was 
affectionately known as Mr. Science. His legacy of service and lifetime 
of contributions helped sustain American leadership across the frontiers 
of scientific knowledge. George Brown's support for science was drawn 
from his deep belief that science and technology could help achieve a 
peaceful world and a just society. For almost 40 years, from his 
earliest days fighting racial inequality, George Brown challenged us to 
build a better world. Our Nation has lost a good man and an 
irreplaceable voice for science and justice.
    Hillary and I extend our deepest condolences to his wife, 
Marta,<Brown, Marta> and to his family.
