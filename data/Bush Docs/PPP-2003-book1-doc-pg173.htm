 Statement on House of Representatives Action on Welfare Reform 
Legislation
 February 13, 2003

     I commend the House for acting quickly on bipartisan welfare reform 
legislation that builds upon our successful efforts that have moved 
millions of Americans from welfare to work. This compassionate approach 
will help many more Americans realize a better life of independence, 
hope, and dignity that comes with having a job. It will also promote 
strong families and healthy marriages, while freeing States to seek 
innovative ways to improve services to those who are transitioning from 
the welfare rolls to the workforce.
     I now urge the Senate to act without delay to strengthen our 
efforts to help our fellow Americans on welfare achieve independence 
through work.
