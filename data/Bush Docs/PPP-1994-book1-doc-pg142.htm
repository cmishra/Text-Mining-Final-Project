Letter Accepting the Resignation of Philip B. Heymann as 
Deputy Attorney General 
January 29, 1994

Dear Phil:
    It is with deep regret that I accept your resignation as Deputy 
Attorney General, effective upon the availability of a successor.
    You brought a most impressive history of service to the Department 
of Justice and distinguished yourself at every turn. During your time as 
Deputy Attorney General, you consistently demonstrated intelligence, 
integrity, sound judgment, and an unyielding commitment to the cause of 
justice.
    I am very grateful for all of your many contributions to my 
Administration and our nation. I wish you the very best as you return to 
your academic career at Harvard Law School.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This letter was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary but was not issued as a White House press release.
