Statement on the Death of International Aid Workers in West Timor
September 6, 2000

    I was deeply saddened to learn today of the death of three dedicated 
international aid workers, including an American citizen, Mr. Carlos 
Caseras.<Caseras, Carlos> Mr. Caseras and his colleagues were 
employees of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees working 
on an international humanitarian effort in West Timor. They were killed, 
and several of their co-workers were injured by local militias who have 
been on a rampage of violence in West Timor. The United States has 
repeatedly called on the Indonesian Government to take the necessary 
actions to disarm and disband these militias. Only such steps will 
create a security environment that enables provision of humanitarian 
assistance, resolution of the refugee problem, and a return to peace in 
Timor.
    This tragedy gives added urgency to the Indonesian Government's 
obligation to turn words into actions on Timor. The Government of 
Indonesia must live up to its commitments to restore order and to ensure 
the safety and welfare of all refugees and foreign nationals.
    I want to extend my personal condolences and that of all Americans 
to Carlos Caseras's family and to the families of the other victims.
