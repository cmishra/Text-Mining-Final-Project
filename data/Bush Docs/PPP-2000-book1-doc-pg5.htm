Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
December 31, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period October 1 to November 30, 1999. The 
previous submission covered events during August and September 1999.
    United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan<Annan, Kofi<ls-thn-eq> 
announced on November 13 the start of proximity talks in New York on 
December 3 to work towards a resolution to the long-standing Cyprus 
dispute. The goal of these talks is to prepare the ground for meaningful 
negotiations leading to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus 
problem.
    This welcome news was highlighted during my trip to Turkey and 
Greece from November 15-20 as a positive step toward bringing about a 
just and lasting solution for all Cypriots and improving Greek-Turkish 
relations for a more secure southern Europe.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on January 3, 2000.
