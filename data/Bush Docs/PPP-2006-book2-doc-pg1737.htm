E.<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of Transportation
September 30, 2006

    I am pleased that the Senate swiftly confirmed Mary Peters as 
Secretary of Transportation.
    Mary is an innovative thinker who will work with State and local 
leaders to confront challenges and solve problems. I look forward to 
working with her to reduce highway and aviation congestion, modernize 
our Nation's infrastructure, and increase the efficiency of travel in 
our country. Her leadership will enable the Department to maintain a 
safe, reliable, and efficient transportation system.
    I congratulate Mary and her family on her confirmation and thank her 
for her service to our Nation.
