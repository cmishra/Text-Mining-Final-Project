    The President announced his intention today to nominate University 
of Arkansas political scientist Diane Blair to be a member of the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
    ``Diane Blair is one of the most capable and committed people I 
know,'' said the President. ``She is one of the most respected people in 
our State and a dear friend of mine and of Hillary's. I think that she 
will do an excellent job of maintaining the Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting's outstanding record.''
