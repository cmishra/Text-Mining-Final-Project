Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report of the Defense Base 
Closure and Realignment Commission
September 15, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:
    I transmit herewith the report containing the recommendations of the 
Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission pursuant to sections 
2903 and 2914 of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, 
Public Law 101-510, 104 Stat. 1810, as amended. That report includes 
changes referenced in errata sheets submitted to me by the Commission, 
including the enclosed errata sheets dated September 8, September 9, 
September 12, and September 13, 2005.
    I note that I am in receipt of a letter from Chairman 
Principi,<Principi, Anthony J.<ls-thn-eq> dated September 8, 2005, 
regarding a district court injunction then in effect relating to the 
Bradley International Airport Air Guard Station in Windsor Locks, 
Connecticut. Chairman Principi's letter states that, as a result of that 
injunction, ``you should consider the portion of Recommendation 85 . . . 
that recommends realignment of the Connecticut 103rd Fighter Wing 
withdrawn from the Commission's report.'' The Chairman's letter further 
states that ``[i]f the court's injunction is later vacated, reversed, 
stayed, or otherwise withdrawn, it is the intent of the Commission that 
the entirety of the recommendation be a part of the Commission's 
report.'' On September 9, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit granted a stay of the district court's injunction. 
Because the injunction is no longer in effect, Recommendation 85 in its 
entirety is part of the Commission's report.
    I certify that I approve all the recommendations contained in the 
Commission's report.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 September 15, 2005.
