Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Evacuation of United States 
Citizens From Rwanda and Burundi
April 12, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    On April 6, 1994, the private plane of Rwandan President Juvenal 
Habyarimana crashed under suspicious circumstances on approach to 
Rwanda's capital, Kigali, killing the President and others, including 
the President of neighboring Burundi. Following the crash, some members 
of the Rwandan military began killing opposition leaders and civilians. 
General fighting broke out, including fighting between government forces 
and forces of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RFP), encamped in Kigali 
under a peace agreement. As violence in the capital escalated, the State 
Department ordered the departure of U.S. Government employees and 
dependents. Combat-equipped U.S. military forces began deploying to 
Burundi to be in a position to conduct possible noncombatant evacuation 
operations of U.S. citizens and designated third-country nationals.
    During April 9-10, 275 Marines were airlifted via C-130 aircraft to 
Bujumbura, Burundi. (A total of 328 U.S. Armed Forces personnel deployed 
to Burundi, including aircrews.) Their mission was to be in position to 
link up with American citizens moving from Rwanda to Burundi via 
overland convoy and to be prepared to proceed to the Rwandan capital of 
Kigali to assist with their departure, if necessary. On April 9-10, 
American citizens proceeded to leave Rwanda by several overland convoys 
to Bujumbura and by other routes. Approximately 240 U.S. citizens were 
evacuated from Rwanda. Most were then flown by U.S. C-141 aircraft to 
Nairobi, Kenya. Approximately 21 citizens chose to remain in Rwanda for 
various reasons. It did not become necessary for U.S. forces to enter 
Rwanda. (United States C-5 aircraft also airlifted Belgian military 
forces and equipment into Nairobi to assist Belgian efforts in support 
of their citizens.)
    I am pleased to report that these operations were successful, that 
no hostilities were encountered, and that no casualties were suffered by 
U.S. forces in this operation.
    I took these actions pursuant to my constitutional authority to 
conduct foreign relations and as Commander in Chief. I am providing this

information as part of my effort to keep the Congress fully informed, 
consistent with the War Powers Resolution. I appreciate the support of 
the Congress for these actions to protect American citizens.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Robert C. Byrd, President pro tempore of 
the Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on April 13.
