    The President announced today his intention to nominate Mollie H.

Service, Department of the Interior. In addition, the President 
announced that his longtime environmental aide Kenneth Smith has been 
appointed the Fish and Wildlife Service's Deputy Director.

ways to protect biological diversity without endangering economic

a big role in that process. I have full confidence in the ability of 
Mollie Beattie and Ken Smith to do the hard work and the fresh thinking
