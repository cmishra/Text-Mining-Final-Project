Statement on Senate Action on Proposed Hate Crimes Legislation
July 22, 1999

    I am gratified that the Senate has unanimously passed the strong 
legislation I proposed to combat hate crimes.
    All Americans deserve protection from hate crimes, and that requires 
us to stand together against intolerance, prejudice, and bigotry. The 
hate crimes prevention act gives power to those values and will help 
make our country more safe and secure.
    Senate approval of this legislation gives it real momentum, and I 
call on the House of Representatives to meet its responsibility in 
combating violence that is fueled by hate. We have some distance to go 
before the hate crimes prevention act is the law of the land, but 
tonight's action by the Senate is a big step forward in the journey 
toward greater protection for all Americans.
