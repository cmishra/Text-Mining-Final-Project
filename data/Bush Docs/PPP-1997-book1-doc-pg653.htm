Statement on Supplemental Emergency Legislation for Disaster Assistance
May 22, 1997

    I urge the Congress not to leave for Memorial Day recess without 
sending me a clean emergency supplemental bill that provides the 
disaster assistance upon which hundreds of thousands of Americans are 
depending. The people of 33 States are waiting for the Congress to act. 
In recent weeks, we have witnessed extraordinary destruction in the 
Dakotas and Minnesota matched only by the courage with which residents 
of these States have faced their plight. The Congress owes it to them to 
pass a clean bill and send it to me for my signature.
