Statement on Disaster Assistance for California
April 15, 1994

    Our administration is doing everything we can to respond to the 
continuing needs of individuals, families, businesses, and communities 
arising from the January earthquake. California's economic future 
depends in part on a strong recovery from the earthquake, and the loans 
and other assistance included in this package will help considerably. 
Our departments and agencies will continue to monitor events in 
California and take whatever actions are needed to meet Federal 
responsibilities there.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement on disaster 
assistance for California.
