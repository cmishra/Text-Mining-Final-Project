Statement on the Agreement To Preserve California's Headwaters Forest
March 2, 1999

    Three years ago we set out to preserve California's Headwaters 
Forest, the world's largest unprotected stand of old-growth redwoods. 
Late yesterday we achieved our goal. We completed an agreement with the 
Pacific Lumber Company to put the Headwaters Forest in public hands and 
ensure that it will never be logged.
    These redwoods are a natural treasure, as much a part of our legacy 
as the world's great libraries and cathedrals. Thanks to the tireless 
efforts of Federal and State negotiators, future generations will know 
the majesty and awe of Headwaters. This ancient forest, and the web of 
life it sustains, are now saved for all time.
    I thank Senator Feinstein<Feinstein, Dianne> and Governor 
Davis<Davis, Gray> for their critical help in achieving this 
historic agreement. And I am truly grateful that we are able to bestow 
this priceless gift on generations yet to come.

Note: A portion of the President's statement was made available on the 
White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
