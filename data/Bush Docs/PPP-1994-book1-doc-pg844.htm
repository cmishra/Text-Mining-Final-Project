Statement on the Implementation of the Israel-Palestinian Declaration of 
Principles
May 4, 1994

    The signing today in Cairo of the agreement to implement the Israel-
Palestinian Declaration of Principles marks another milestone in 
progress toward a lasting peace in the Middle East. On behalf of all 
Americans, I have called Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat to 
congratulate them for this accomplishment. I expressed my high regard 
for Prime Minister Rabin's courageous leadership and stressed to 
Chairman Arafat the importance of moving without hesitation to make this 
agreement a reality. I also telephoned yesterday and again today 
President Mubarak to underscore our gratitude and appreciation for the 
key role he played in making this historic step forward possible.
    Now the focus must be on implementing the Declaration of Principles 
in as rapid and successful a manner as possible. The process of 
transforming the situation on the ground for the better must begin. The 
promise of a new future of hope for Israelis and Palestinians alike must 
now be realized. I assured Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat that 
the United States would do everything possible to help make this happen.
    Building on the progress achieved today and our ongoing discussions 
with parties in the region, I am hopeful that this can be the year of 
breakthrough to a lasting and comprehensive peace for all the peoples of 
the Middle East.
