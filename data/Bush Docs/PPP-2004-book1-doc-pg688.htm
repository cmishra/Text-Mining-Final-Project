Statement on the United Nations Security Council's Resolution on Weapons 
of Mass Destruction
April 28, 2004

    Last September, I called on the United Nations Security Council to 
urge the cooperative action of all U.N. members against the illicit 
trafficking of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. I commend 
today's unanimous Security Council resolution, which answers that call.
    It now remains for all member states to act on the measures urged by 
this resolution. Member states should enact strict
export controls, criminalize the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, and secure all related materials within their borders.

    Today's resolution is an important achievement. We must continue to 
press these efforts to ensure that the world's most destructive weapons 
are kept from the world's most dangerous regimes and organizations.
