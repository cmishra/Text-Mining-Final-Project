Message on the Observance of the Lunar New Year
January 14, 1998

    Warm greetings to all those celebrating the Lunar New Year.
    This joyous occasion celebrates the blessings of family, community, 
and a rich and ancient heritage. It is a special time to reflect on the 
events of the previous year and to embrace the challenges of the year 
ahead. Vibrant with color, lights, dancing, parades, folk music, and 
delicious food, the Lunar New Year reminds all of us of the beauty and 
variety of Asian culture and of the strength, character, and achievement 
that Asian Americans bring to our national life.
    As we join you in welcoming the Year of the Tiger, Hillary and I 
extend best wishes to all for a new year full of health, happiness, 
prosperity, and peace.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
January 20.
