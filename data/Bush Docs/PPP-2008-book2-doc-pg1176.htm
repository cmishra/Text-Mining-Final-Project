    Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tee-ball on the South Lawn. 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are honored you are here, and we 
welcome the military families and players from all across the United 
States of America.

us a chance to thank your moms and dads for their sacrifice and service 
to the United States of America.
    I'm proud to be here with the honorary commissioner,<Mullen, Michael 
G.<ls-thn-eq> Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen.

Welcome, Tom. Thanks for coming, and thanks for bringing 
Jeannemarie.<Devolites-Davis, Jeannemarie<ls-thn-eq> Glad you all are

    What an honor it is to have Rascal Flatts not only play the national 
anthem, but entertain you at the picnic at the South Lawn after the 
game. Thank you guys for coming.
    I do want to thank the Dunbar High School Junior ROTC for carrying 
the flag. Welcome; thank you all for coming.
    Handling the first base coaching duties, former New York Yankee, 
Bernie Williams;<Williams, Bernabe F. ``Bernie''<ls-thn-eq> third base, 
General Pete Pace.<Pace, Peter<ls-thn-eq>
    I'm about to--we don't actually throw out the first pitch here at 
the South Lawn. We have ball presenters: Ambassador Karen 
Hughes,<Hughes, Karen P.<ls-thn-eq> who helped originate tee-ball at the 
White House 20 games ago, as well as the CEO and president of Little

today--first, Tim McCarver,<McCarver, Tim<ls-thn-eq> FOX; all-star 
catcher, 19--on the 1964 Cardinal World Series team; awesome guy. And 
with him, from FOX and Friends, Brian Kilmeade.<Kilmeade, 
Brian<ls-thn-eq>
    I don't think we could have had a better broadcast team for this, 
the final game for tee-ball on the South Lawn. I do want to thank all 
the Little League staff members who have been working with us since 
2001: Lance Van Auken,<Van Auken, Lance<ls-thn-eq> Mac 
McGlothlin,<McGlothlin, Mac<ls-thn-eq> and Katie [Kathie]*

    And now, before we begin the game--I know anticipation is rising 
here--we will have the Little League Pledge. Are the players ready? You 
are ready? You repeat after me.
