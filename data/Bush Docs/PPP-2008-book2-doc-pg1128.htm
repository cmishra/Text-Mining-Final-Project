    Congratulations for representing the finest nation on the face of 
the Earth. The honorary captain<Bush, George H.W.<ls-thn-eq> and I are 
proud to be with you. We're here to wish you all the very best.
    First, I want to say thanks to the U.S. Olympic Committee, chaired 
by Peter Ueberroth,<Ueberroth, Peter V.<ls-thn-eq> CEO Jim 
Scherr,<Scherr, Jim<ls-thn-eq> Judge Charles Lee.<Lee, Charles 
C.<ls-thn-eq> I wasn't exactly sure what to say to you, except to start 
with, God, I love our country, and I love what we stand for, and I love 
being with you.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I and a lot of our family are here 
to cheer you on. We're just a handful of a lot of folks who care about 
you a lot. There are going to be a lot of people pulling for you. We 
want you to win as many golds as you possibly can.
    We appreciate all the hard work you've put in to get to this spot. 
It's got to be really exciting, thinking about marching in that stadium 
and representing our country. So I guess all I've got to say is, go for 
it, give it all you've got, and may God bless you.
