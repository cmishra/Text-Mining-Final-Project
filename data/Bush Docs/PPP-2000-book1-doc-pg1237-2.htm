Statement on Action To Prosecute for the Killing of United States 
Department of Agriculture Inspectors
June 23, 2000

    Today the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California 
filed a complaint charging an individual<Alexander, Stuart<ls-thn-eq> 
with the intentional killing of two U.S. Department of Agriculture 
inspectors in the course of their duties. I want to commend Federal and 
local law enforcement for working so quickly to investigate and 
prosecute this important case. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of 
the victims, their families, and the community during this difficult 
time.
