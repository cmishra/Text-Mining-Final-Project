Statement on Russian State Duma Action on the START II Treaty
April 14, 2000

    I am very pleased that the Russian State Duma today approved the 
START II Treaty--a critical step toward the treaty's entering into 
force. This action builds on decades of cooperation between the United 
States and Russia to reduce nuclear arms and clearly advances the 
interests of both countries. Together with the START I Treaty, it will 
result in a two-thirds reduction in the strategic nuclear weapons that 
the Soviet Union and the United States maintained at the height of the 
cold war. START II will make our people safer and our partnership with a 
democratic Russia stronger. It will open the door to further significant 
steps to reduce nuclear arms and the nuclear danger, a course that is 
strongly supported by the international community and has strong 
bipartisan support in the United States.
    I congratulate President-elect Putin<Putin, Vladimir<ls-thn-eq> and 
his government, members of the State Duma, and Russian citizens who 
supported this giant step toward a safer future. I look forward to 
prompt action on the treaty by the Federation Council. Now, we and 
Russia can and must seize this opportunity to intensify our discussions 
on both START III and the ABM Treaty, so we can take further concrete 
steps this year to strengthen the security of the United States, Russia, 
and indeed the whole world.
