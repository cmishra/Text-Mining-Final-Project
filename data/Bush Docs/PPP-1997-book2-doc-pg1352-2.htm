Statement on the Death of John Denver
October 13, 1997

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of John Denver. 
His soaring music evoked the grandeur of our landscape and the simple 
warmth of human love. He was a dedicated champion of the environment, 
spending many hours on the vital work of protecting natural heritage. 
And he opened many doors to understanding among nations through his 
tours of the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam. Our thoughts and prayers 
go out to his family and to his millions of fans.
