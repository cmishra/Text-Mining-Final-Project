Message to the Congress Transmitting the District of Columbia Fiscal 
Year 1998 Budget Request
July 11, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 202(c)(5)(C)(ii) of the Financial 
Responsibility and Management Assistance Act of 1995 (``the FRMA Act''), 
I am transmitting the Council of the District of Columbia's ``Fiscal 
Year 1998 Budget Request Act of 1997.''
    The Council's proposed Fiscal Year 1998 Budget was disapproved by 
the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority (the 
``Authority'') on June 12. Under the FRMA Act, if the Authority 
disapproves the Council's financial plan and budget, the Mayor must 
submit that budget to the President to be transmitted to the Congress. 
My transmittal of the District Council's budget, as required by law, 
does not represent an endorsement of its contents. The budget also does 
not reflect the effect of my proposed Fiscal Year 1998 District of 
Columbia revitalization plan.
    The Authority is required to transmit separately to the Mayor, the 
Council, the President, and the Congress a financial plan and budget. 
The Authority sent its financial plan and budget to the Congress on June 
15.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 11, 1997.
