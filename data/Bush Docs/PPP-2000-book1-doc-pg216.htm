Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on the Extension of Normal 
Trade Relations Status for Albania
February 9, 2000

To the Congress of the United States:
    I am submitting an updated report to the Congress concerning the 
emigration laws and policies of Albania. The report indicates continued 
Albanian compliance with U.S. and international standards in the area of 
emigration. In fact, Albania has imposed no emigration restrictions, 
including exit visa requirements, on its population since 1991.

    On December 5, 1997, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Albania was not in violation of paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of 
subsection 402(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 or paragraphs (1), (2), or 
(3) of subsection 409(a) of that Act. That action allowed for the 
continuation of normal trade relations (NTR) status for Albania and 
certain other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver. 
This semiannual report is submitted as required by law pursuant to the 
determination of December 5, 1997.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 9, 2000.
