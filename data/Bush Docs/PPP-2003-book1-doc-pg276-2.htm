Message on the Observance of Saint Patrick's Day, 2003
March 17, 2003

    I send greetings to those celebrating St. Patrick's Day.
    On this day, we honor the life of Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, 
and celebrate the rich history of the Emerald Isle. St. Patrick escaped 
from slavery and dedicated his life to helping others through his words 
and actions. His example of courage, determination, and faith captured 
the hearts of the Irish and continues to inspire countless people around 
the world.

    In the United States, this day gives us an opportunity to recognize 
the vital contributions of Irish Americans. Throughout our history, 
America has welcomed millions of Irish immigrants to our country. These 
individuals have transformed our national identity and strengthened our 
families, our communities, and our national character.
    Today, approximately one in four Americans can trace their ancestry 
in part to Ireland's green shores. We are proud of our deep and lasting 
ties to Ireland and are grateful for the many Irish Americans who 
continue to enrich our Nation.
    Laura<Bush, Laura> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a happy St. Patrick's Day.

                                                          George W. Bush
