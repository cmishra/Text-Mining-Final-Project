Remarks at a Tree Planting Ceremony in Honor of Arbor Day
April 29, 2005

    The President. Glad you all are here. Ready, Mr. Secretary?<Johanns, 
Mike<ls-thn-eq>
    Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns.<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> I'm 
ready.
    The President. First of all, I'm honored--we're honored to be here 
with the Secretary of Agriculture<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> as well as 
Marshal Case,<Case, Marshal T.<ls-thn-eq> who is head of The American 
Chestnut Foundation. We are planting an American chestnut tree here at 
the White House. This is the 133d year of Arbor Day. Our message is to 
our fellow citizens: Plant trees. It's good for the economy, and it's 
good for the environment.
    As well, Marshal<Case, Marshal T.<ls-thn-eq> informs me that The 
American Chestnut Foundation has worked very closely with the 
Agriculture Department to coming up with a disease-resistant strain of 
the American chestnut. And he says we're making good progress and that 
one day the American chestnut, which had been wiped out by blight, will 
be coming back. And this is our little part to help it come back.
    So, Mr. Secretary,<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> are you prepared?
    Secretary Johanns.<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> I am ready. Let's----
    The President. A man<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> known for shoveling a 
lot of things. [Laughter]
    Secretary Johanns.<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> Exactly.
    The President. Ready to go?
    Secretary Johanns.<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> Yes, I am ready.
    The President. All right, let's do it.

Note: The President spoke at 1 p.m. on the North Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Marshal T. Case, president and 
chief executive officer, The American Chestnut Foundation. A tape was 
not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
