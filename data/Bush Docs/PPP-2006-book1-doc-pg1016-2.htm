Statement on the Department of Justice's Handling of Representative 
William J. Jefferson's<Jefferson, William J.<ls-thn-eq> Materials
May 25, 2006

    Over the last several days, the House of Representatives and the 
Department of Justice have attempted to resolve a dispute over the 
execution of a search warrant on the Capitol Hill office of Congressman 
William Jefferson, who is under criminal investigation.
    The Department of Justice's search was part of an important 
investigation of alleged public corruption. At the same time, the 
bipartisan leadership of the House of Representatives believes this 
search violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers and 
the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution. They note these 
principles must be adhered to, even in the pursuit of a legitimate 
criminal investigation.
    I recognize these are deeply held views. Our Government has not 
faced such a dilemma in more than two centuries. Yet after days of 
discussions, it is clear these differences will require more time to be 
worked out.
    So today I am directing the Department of Justice to seal all the 
materials recovered from Congressman Jefferson's office for the next 45 
days and not to allow access to anyone involved in the investigation. I 
am also ordering the sealed materials to remain under the custody of the 
Solicitor<Clement, Paul D.<ls-thn-eq> General, who heads a separate 
office within the Justice Department and is not involved in the 
investigation.
    This period will provide both parties more time to resolve the 
issues in a way that ensures that materials relevant to the ongoing 
criminal investigation are made available to prosecutors in a manner 
that respects the interests of a coequal branch of Government. The 
Justice Department and the House of Representatives should continue 
their discussions and resolve this matter as quickly as possible.
    Let me be clear: Investigating and prosecuting crime is a crucial 
executive responsibility that I take seriously. Those who violate the 
law--including a Member of Congress--should and will be held to account. 
This investigation will go forward, and justice will be served.
