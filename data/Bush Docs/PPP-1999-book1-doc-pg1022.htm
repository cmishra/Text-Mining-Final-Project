Radio Remarks on House Action on Foster Care Independence Legislation
June 25, 1999

    I am very pleased the House of Representatives has just approved, by 
an overwhelming bipartisan margin, the ``Foster Care Independence Act.'' 
This legislation would expand access to health care, education, housing, 
and counseling for young people who leave foster care upon their 18th 
birthday. I am very grateful to the bill's sponsors, Nancy 
Johnson<Johnson, Nancy L.> and Ben Cardin.<Cardin, Benjamin 
L.> I also want to thank my wife for her early, early alert 
about the importance of this issue. I look forward to working with 
members of both parties to pass similar legislation in the Senate. 
Together, we must help all our foster children make the transition to 
independence. We can't leave them out there alone. Instead, we must 
support them in living up to their full, God-given potential.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 6:10 p.m. 
on June 25 in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast. 
These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office 
Radio Actuality Line.
