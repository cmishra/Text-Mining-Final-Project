Statement on Flooding and Tornadoes in Georgia
October 19, 1994

    My heart is with the people of Georgia. I admire their courageous 
work in repairing their communities from the floods this summer, and my 
thoughts are with them as they battle these latest forces of nature.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
disaster assistance for Georgia due to flooding and tornadoes that began 
October 1.
