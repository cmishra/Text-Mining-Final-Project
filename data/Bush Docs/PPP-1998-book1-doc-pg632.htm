Subject: 1998 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area

    I am delighted that Rodney E. Slater,<Slater, Rodney E.<ls-thn-eq> 
Secretary of Transportation, has agreed to again serve as the Chair of 
the 1998 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area. I ask 
you to support the campaign by personally chairing the campaign in your

successful campaign this year.
