Message to the Congress Reporting on the Executive Order on 
Clarification of Certain Executive Orders Blocking Property and 
Prohibiting Certain Transactions
February 16, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:
    Pursuant to, inter alia, section 203(a) of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, (50 U.S.C. 1702(a)) (IEEPA) and section 
201(a) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621(a)) (NEA), I 
exercised my statutory authority to declare national emergencies in 
Executive Orders 13224 of September 23, 2001, as amended, and 12947 of 
January 23, 1995, as amended. I have issued a new Executive Order that 
clarifies certain measures taken to address those national emergencies. 
This new Executive Order relates to powers conferred to me by section 
203(b)(2) of IEEPA and clarifies that the Executive Orders at issue 
prohibit a blocked United States person from making humanitarian 
donations.
    The amendments made to those Executive Orders by the new Executive 
Order take effect as of the date of the new order, and specific licenses 
issued pursuant to the prior Executive Orders continue in effect, unless 
revoked or amended by the Secretary of the Treasury. General licenses, 
regulations, orders, and directives issued pursuant to the prior 
Executive Orders continue in effect, except to the extent inconsistent 
with this order or otherwise revoked or modified by the Secretary of the 
Treasury.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 February 16, 2005.

Note: The Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
