Statement on the Train Fire in Al-Avyat, Egypt
February 22, 2002

    I am profoundly saddened by the terrible loss of life in the train 
fire in Al-Avyat. This tragedy is all the more horrible because it took 
place during the holiday of Eid al-Adha. Laura and I and all of the 
American people offer our deepest sympathy and condolences to 
President<Mubarak, Hosni> Mubarak, the Egyptian people, and 
especially to those families who have lost loved ones.
