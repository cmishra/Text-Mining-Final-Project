Statement on the Bombing in Najaf, Iraq
August 29, 2003

    I strongly condemn the bombing today outside the Imam Ali mosque in 
Najaf, Iraq, that killed dozens of innocent Iraqis. This vicious act of 
terrorism was aimed at Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim,<al-Hakim, 
Mohammed Baqir<ls-thn-eq> at one of Shi'a Islam's holiest sites, and at 
the hopes of the people of Iraq for freedom, peace, and reconciliation.
    I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and 
my hopes for a quick recovery for the injured. I have instructed 
American officials in Iraq to work closely with Iraqi security officials 
and the Governing Council to determine who committed this terrible 
attack and bring them to justice. I also extend my sympathies to all 
Iraqis and to Shi'a Muslims around the world.
    Ayatollah Hakim<al-Hakim, Mohammed Baqir<ls-thn-eq> had been jailed 
and tortured for his religious beliefs by the regime of Saddam 
Hussein,<Hussein, Saddam<ls-thn-eq> and he had spent many years in 
exile. He returned to his native land this year after its liberation. 
His murder today, along with the murder of many innocent men and women 
gathered for prayer, demonstrates the cruelty and desperation of the 
enemies of the Iraqi people.
    The forces of terror must and will be defeated. The united efforts 
of Iraqis and the international community will succeed in achieving 
peace and freedom.
