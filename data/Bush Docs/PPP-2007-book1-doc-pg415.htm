Statement on Jackie Robinson
April 14, 2007

    On April 15, 1947, an African American wearing the number 42 broke 
baseball's color barrier. Jackie Robinson's courage and skill convinced 
players, coaches, and fans to judge an athlete by his performance and 
not the color of his skin. His leadership strengthened America's pastime 
and strengthened America. Sixty years later, our Nation celebrates 
Jackie Robinson's accomplishments and his legacy, and we give thanks for 
his extraordinary life.
