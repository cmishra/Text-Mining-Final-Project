Remarks on Hurricane Ike Recovery Efforts
September 13, 2008

    Good morning. I just finished a video conference with Secretary 
Chertoff,<Chertoff, Michael<ls-thn-eq> Director Paulison,<Paulison, R. 
David<ls-thn-eq> and other people about Hurricane Ike.
    Obviously, this is a huge storm that is causing a lot of damage not 
only in Texas, but also in parts of Louisiana. The storm has yet to 
pass, and I know there are people concerned about their lives. Some 
people didn't evacuate when asked, and I've been briefed on the rescue 
teams there in the area. They're prepared to move as soon as weather 
conditions permit. Obviously, people on the ground there are sensitive 
to helping people and are fully prepared to do so.
    Secondly, I've asked Secretary Chertoff<Chertoff, Michael<ls-thn-eq> 
to go down as soon as weather conditions permit. I suspect he'll be able 
to get down to Texas this afternoon and will be in the Gulf Coast 
region, hopefully, within a reasonable period of time to help the State 
of Texas officials, as well as local officials, begin the recovery 
effort. There's going to be a need for Federal, State, and local 
coordination as this storm moves through east Texas.
    Obviously, there will be concerns about electricity. We've got 
generators in place, generators moving into the area to help. They'll be 
concerned about water and ice. They'll be concerned about energy, and 
I'm concerned about energy.
    Now, this administration has moved quickly. Last night, we suspended 
EPA waivers on certain reformulated gasolines, which will make it easier 
for imports from abroad to make it into our markets. In the meantime, 
the Department of Energy, the Federal Trade Commission, and, I know, 
State authorities will be monitoring gasoline prices to make sure 
consumers are not being gouged, make sure consumers are being treated 
fairly.
    As this massive storm moves through the Gulf Coast, people of that 
area can be rest assured that the American people will be praying for 
them and will be ready to help once the storm moves on.

Note: The President spoke at 8:39 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish 
language transcript of these remarks.
