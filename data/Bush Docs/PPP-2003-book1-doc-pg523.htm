Statement on the Resignation of Christine Todd Whitman<Whitman, 
Christine> Todd as Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency
May 21, 2003

    Christie Todd Whitman is a trusted friend and adviser who has worked 
closely with me to achieve real and meaningful results to improve our 
environment.
    Christie Todd has been a dedicated and tireless fighter for new and 
innovative policies for cleaner air, purer water, and better protected 
land.
    In just over 2 years, we have acted in a comprehensive way to reduce 
pollution from diesel fuel sources and implemented an innovative 
initiative to better protect our water quality and watersheds. We are 
cleaning up abandoned industrial sites and turning them into assets for 
the communities in which they are located. We are also making great 
progress on the Clear Skies Initiative that I outlined to significantly 
reduce pollution from powerplants by 70 percent.
    Christie Todd Whitman has served my administration exceptionally 
well. I thank her for her outstanding service to our Nation and wish her 
well as she returns home to New Jersey.
