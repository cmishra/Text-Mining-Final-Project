Remarks at a Swearing-In Ceremony for Condoleezza Rice<Rice, 
Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of State
January 28, 2005

    Thank you all for coming. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are 
honored to be here. Over the past 4 years, America has benefited from 
the wise counsel of Dr. Condoleezza Rice and our family has been 
enriched by our friendship with this remarkable person. We love her. I 
don't know if you're supposed to say that about the Secretary of State. 
[Laughter]
    Condi--appointment and confirmation of Secretary of State marks a 
remarkable transition in what is already a career of outstanding service 
and accomplishment.
    Today also marks an opportunity to honor another career defined by 
service and accomplishment. Throughout a lifetime spent in public 
service, Colin Powell<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> has asked nothing in 
return. For over four decades, millions at home and abroad have 
benefited from his bravery, his dignity, and his integrity. He's left 
our Nation a better place than it was when he began his career in public 
service as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. His 
magnificent wife, Alma,<Powell, Alma V. Johnson<ls-thn-eq> I am certain 
is pleased that a grateful nation is giving back her husband--
[laughter]--and all of us admire and appreciate the service of Colin 
Powell.
    I appreciate the fact that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg<Ginsburg, 
Ruth Bader<ls-thn-eq> administered the oath. It was neighborly of her to 
do that. [Laughter] I want to thank Congresswoman Jane Harman<Harman, 
Jane F.<ls-thn-eq> from California for joining us, as well as Juanita 
Millender-McDonald<Millender-McDonald, Juanita<ls-thn-eq> from 
California. We're honored you both are here. Thanks for taking time to 
honor your fellow Californian, Condi Rice.
    I see sitting between you two is a fine American in Andrew 
Young.<Young, Andrew Jackson, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Welcome, Andy. Thank you 
for coming. I shouldn't start going around the room heralding all the--
[laughter]--accomplished souls who are here. I do want to thank members 
of the diplomatic corps for coming. I appreciate Your Excellencies 
taking time to honor Condi. I want to thank the distinguished guests and 
members--folks who work at the State Department for joining us as well. 
It's a good thing to come and honor your new boss--[laughter]--good 
diplomacy--[laughter].
    Colin Powell<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> leaves big shoes to fill at 
the State Department, but Condi Rice is the right person to fill them. 
As National Security Adviser, she has led during a time when events not 
of our choosing have forced America to the leading edge of history. 
Condi has an abiding belief in the power of democracy to secure justice 
and liberty and the inclusion of men and women of all races and 
religions in the courses that free nations chart for themselves.
    A few days from now, these convictions will be confirmed by the 
Iraqi people when they cast their ballots in Iraq's first free elections 
in generations. Sunday's election is the first step in a process that 
will allow Iraqis to write and pass a constitution that enshrines self-
government and the rule of law. This history is changing the world, 
because the advent of democracy in Iraq will serve as a powerful example 
to reformers throughout the entire Middle East. On Sunday, the Iraqi 
people will be joining millions in other parts of the world who now 
decide their future through free votes.

    In Afghanistan, the people have voted in the first free Presidential 
elections in that nation's 5,000-year history. The people of Ukraine 
have made clear their own desire for democracy. The Palestinians have 
just elected a new President<Abbas, Mahmoud ``Abu Mazen''<ls-thn-eq> who 
has repudiated violence. Freedom is on the march, and the world is 
better for it.
    Widespread hatred and radicalism cannot survive the advent of 
freedom and self-government. Our Nation will be more secure, the world 
will be more peaceful as freedom advances. Condi Rice understands that. 
And the terrorists understand that as well, and that is why they are now 
attacking Iraqi civilians in an effort to sabotage elections. We applaud 
the courage of ordinary Iraqis for their refusal to surrender their 
future to these killers.
    No nation can build a safer and better world alone. The men and 
women of the State Department are doing a fine job of working with other 
nations to build on the momentum of freedom. I know our Nation will be 
really well served when the good folks at the State Department join with 
Condi Rice to face the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. 
In the coming months and years, we must stop the proliferation of 
dangerous weapons and materials. We must safeguard and expand the 
freedom of international marketplace and free trade. We must advance 
justice and fundamental human rights. We must fight HIV/AIDS and other 
diseases and reduce poverty.
    Each task will require good relations with nations around the world, 
and each will require a Secretary who will lead by character and 
conviction and wisdom. To meet these times and tasks, America has its 
best in Dr. Condoleezza Rice, now Secretary Condoleezza Rice, our 66th 
Secretary of State.

Note: The President spoke at 9:58 a.m. at the U.S. Department of State. 
In his remarks, he referred to former U.S. Ambassador to the United 
Nations Andrew Young; and President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) of the 
Palestinian Authority. The transcript released by the Office of the 
Press Secretary also included the remarks of Secretary Rice.
