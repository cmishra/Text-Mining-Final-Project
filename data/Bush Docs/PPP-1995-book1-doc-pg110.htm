Statement on the Death of Jim Grant
January 28, 1995

    It was with deep sadness and regret that Hillary and I learned today 
of the death of Jim Grant, executive director of UNICEF. Throughout his 
long career, Jim Grant was a visionary leader, one of the most 
distinguished international public servants of our time. It was in 
recognition of Jim Grant's lifelong contributions that I was honored to 
present him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom last August.
    Under Jim Grant's 15 years of leadership, UNICEF has earned a 
reputation as one of the most effective and esteemed U.N. agencies. 
UNICEF retains its special place in the hearts of all Americans.
    We will remember Jim Grant most for his tireless advocacy on behalf 
of the world's children and for pioneering low-cost, simple techniques 
for alleviating disease, poverty, and suffering among the neediest of 
children. One measure of his legacy lies in the fact that today 80 
percent of children in the developing world receive immunizations, 
compared with 20 percent in 1980 when Jim Grant assumed leadership of 
UNICEF.
    Today we have lost a personal friend, an American hero and champion 
of children throughout the world. We will all miss him.
