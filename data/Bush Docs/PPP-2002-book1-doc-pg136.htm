Message to the Congress on Termination of Suspensions Pertaining to the 
Export of Certain Defense Articles or Services to China
January 25, 2002

To the Congress of the United States:
    Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902 of the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-
246) (the ``Act''), and as President of the United States, I hereby 
report to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the United 
States to terminate the suspensions under section 902 of the Act insofar 
as such suspensions pertain to the export of defense articles or defense 
services in support of efforts by the Government of Japan to destroy 
Japanese chemical weapons abandoned during World War II in the People's 
Republic of China. License requirements remain in place for these 
exports and require review and approval on a case-by-case basis by the 
United States Government.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 January 25, 2002.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
January 30.
