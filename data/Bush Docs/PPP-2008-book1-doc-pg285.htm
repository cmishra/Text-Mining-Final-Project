Statement on the Death of William F. Buckley, Jr.<Buckley, William F., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq>
February 27, 2008

    America has lost one of its finest writers and thinkers. Bill 
Buckley was one of the great founders of the modern conservative 
movement. He brought conservative thought into the political mainstream 
and helped lay the intellectual foundation for America's victory in the 
cold war and for the conservative movement that continues to this day. 
He will be remembered for his principled thought and beautiful writing, 
as well as his personal warmth, wit, and generous spirit. His legacy 
lives on in the ideas he championed and in the magazine he founded, 
National Review.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our prayers to Chris 
Buckley,<Buckley, Christopher<ls-thn-eq> the Buckley family, and all who 
loved this good man.
