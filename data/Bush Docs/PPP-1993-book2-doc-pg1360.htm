Nomination for Director of the Institute of Museum Services
August 10, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Diane B. 
Frankel to be Director of the Institute of Museum Services, National 
Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities.
    ``Diane Frankel has spent her career strengthening the commitment to 
teaching in the museums in which she has worked and fostering closer 
ties between museums and their local communities,'' the President said. 
``With her unique background as the founder of her own museum, I am 
confident she will do an excellent job directing the IMS in its efforts 
to support America's museums, historical sites, and zoos.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
