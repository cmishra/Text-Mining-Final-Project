Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting Budget Rescissions
February 20, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report 24 proposed rescissions of budgetary 
resources, totaling $20 million.
    These proposed rescissions affect programs of the Departments of 
Agriculture, the Interior, and Transportation.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
report detailing the proposed rescissions was published in the Federal 
Register on February 27.
