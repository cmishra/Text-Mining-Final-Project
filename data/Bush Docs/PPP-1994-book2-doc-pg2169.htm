Statement on the Resignation of Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General
December 9, 1994

    Dr. Joycelyn Elders is a physician of outstanding ability, energy, 
and commitment. As a pediatrician, she dedicated her life to improving 
the health of children. As Surgeon General, she worked tirelessly to 
reduce teen pregnancy and AIDS and to improve the health of all 
Americans, especially our children.
    Dr. Elders' public statements reflecting differences with 
administration policy and my own convictions have made it necessary for 
her to tender her resignation.
    Those statements in no way diminish her devotion to her work and the 
enormous positive impact she has had on the problems she tackled and the 
people she served.
    I will always be grateful for her service.
