Statement on the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission
June 30, 1994

    I would like to offer, on behalf of our Nation, my heartfelt thanks 
and appreciation for Jim Courter's important contributions in leading 
the 1991 and 1993 base realignment and closure reviews.
    I am proud of the success of the Base Closure Commission during my 
administration. The base closure process has been nonpartisan, very 
effective, and continues to be of the highest importance to our efforts 
to reduce unnecessary base infrastructure in order to keep our military 
forces ready and strong.
    While serving as Chair to the Commission, Mr. Courter recommended 
base closures and realignments which will enable the Federal Government 
to save billions of dollars over the next several years.
    I am grateful for Jim Courter's tenacity, hard work, and commitment 
to building a stronger economy, and I wish him the very best in his new 
endeavors.
