Appointment of Deputy Chief of Staff for White House Operations
September 23, 1994

    The President today named Erskine B. Bowles, currently the 
Administrator of the Small Business Administration, as his Deputy Chief 
of Staff for White House Operations. Mr. Bowles, who will also be an 
Assistant to the President, will take over his new responsibilities on 
October 3.
    In the new White House staff structure, also announced today by 
Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Bowles will be responsible for 
internal White House operations as well as the day-to-day activities of 
the President and will oversee access to the Oval Office.
    The offices reporting to him will be the Office of Scheduling and 
Advance, the Office of Management and Administration, the Office of 
Presidential Personnel, and the Office of the Staff Secretary, as well 
as the Director of Oval Office Operations.
    ``I am very excited that Erskine is coming to the White House,'' the 
President said. ``As SBA Administrator, he turned around an agency that 
previous administrations had neglected. It has become a beacon of 
support for the Nation's small businesses, and it now responds with 
incredible speed and sensitivity to major disasters. Erskine will 
undoubtedly bring to the White House the same vigor and creativity with 
which he has headed the SBA.''

Note: A biography of the appointee was made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
