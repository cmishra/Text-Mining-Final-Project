Message on the Observance of Saint Patrick's Day, 2000
March 17, 2000

    Warm greetings to everyone observing Saint Patrick's Day.
    It is most fitting that the feast day of the Patron Saint of Ireland 
should be held on the threshold of spring, the season of promise, for 
the Irish have always been a people of promise. With warm hearts and a 
deep spirituality, they embraced the promise of salvation that Saint 
Patrick brought to their beautiful island 16 centuries ago and preserved 
their faith through the tumult and chaos of the Dark Ages.
    In the 19th century, suffering from famine and oppression in their 
own land, millions of Irish men and women recognized the promise of 
freedom and opportunity in America. Often enduring great hardship, they 
journeyed west to begin a new life in a new land. With strength and 
humor, courage and determination, they made America's promise a reality 
for themselves and their children and enriched our history and heritage 
with their achievements. In business, labor, education, the arts, public 
life, and so

much more, Irish Americans have made lasting contributions to the life 
of our nation.
    Today Irish Americans and the people of their ancestral homeland 
share a strong commitment to the promise of peace. In the spring of 
1998, the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland sought to fulfill that 
promise when they voted overwhelmingly in support of the Good Friday 
Accord. America remains committed to the Irish people as they continue 
working to forge a brighter future, for, while the road ahead is long, 
the promise of peace is still within reach and its rewards are great.
    As Irish Americans gather once again to honor Saint Patrick and to 
reaffirm their pride in their Irish heritage, Hillary and I extend 
warmest wishes to all for a wonderful celebration.

                                                            Bill Clinton
