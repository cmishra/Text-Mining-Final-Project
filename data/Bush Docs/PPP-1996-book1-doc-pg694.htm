Statement on the Death of William Colby
May 6, 1996

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of former Director 
of Central Intelligence William Colby. Through a quarter century at the 
CIA, William Colby played a pivotal role in shaping our Nation's 
intelligence community. A dedicated public servant, he ably led the 
Agency through challenging times. He made tough decisions when 
necessary, and he was always guided by the core values of the country he 
loved. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends in this 
time of sorrow and grieving.
