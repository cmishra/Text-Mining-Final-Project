Statement on the Retirement of Michael Jordan From the Chicago Bulls
October 6, 1993

    As a sports fan who has had the great pleasure of watching Michael 
Jordan play basketball since the early 1980's, I was saddened to hear 
his announcement today that he was retiring from the game. But, I think 
we can all understand his wish to take his leave and devote himself to 
more private concerns.
    We will miss him, here and all around America, in every small-town 
backyard and paved city lot where kids play one-on-one and dream of 
being like Mike.
    His gift to us all has been in giving everything he had game after 
game, year in and year out. It has been our privilege for the last 
decade to see him gracing the hardwood, lighting up our TV screens, and 
brightening the lives of the young at heart all around the world.
    I want to wish Michael and his family the very best. I know that the 
past several months have been difficult ones, and I hope that he can 
enjoy the peace of mind that he richly deserves.
