Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with the resolution of advice and consent to 
ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their

    In connection with Condition (9), Protection of Advanced 
Biotechnology, the legitimate commercial activities and interests of 
chemical, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical firms in the United States 
are not being significantly harmed by the limitations of the Convention 
on access to, and production of, those chemicals and toxins listed in 
Schedule 1 of the Annex on Chemicals.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton
