Remarks Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel
December 2, 2001

    In a couple of minutes I'll have the honor of receiving the Prime 
Minister from Israel.<Sharon, Ariel> We obviously changed our 
schedule because of the horrific acts of murder that took place in his 
land.
    I will tell him<Sharon, Ariel> that I strongly condemn the 
acts of murder that killed innocent people in Israel. I will tell him 
our Nation grieves for those whose lives have been affected by the 
murderers.
    This is a moment where the advocates for peace in the Middle East 
must rise up and fight terror. Chairman Arafat<Arafat, Yasser> 
must do everything in his power to find those who murdered innocent 
Israelis and bring them to justice.
    Clearly, there are some in the world who do not want us to achieve 
peace in the Middle East. Clearly, there are some that, every chance 
they have, they will use violence and terror to disrupt any progress 
that's being made. We must not allow them to succeed. We must not allow 
terror to destroy the chance of peace in the Middle East.
    Now is the time for leaders throughout the world who urge there to 
be a peace to do something about the terror that prevents peace from 
happening in the first place.
    May God bless the Israeli citizens who lost their lives, and their 
families.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:26 a.m. on the South Grounds at the 
White House upon returning from Camp David, MD. In his remarks, he 
referred to Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority.
