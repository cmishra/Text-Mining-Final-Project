Statement on Additional California Earthquake Assistance
March 18, 1994

    The people of southern California are responding courageously to the 
challenge of restoring their lives and their communities in the wake of 
the earthquake. From the first day, our administration has been working 
extremely hard to fulfill the Federal Government's obligation to help 
make that possible.
    This new assistance reflects new costs that have come to our 
attention in recent weeks. My administration is continuing to monitor 
the situation, and we will continue to provide the necessary assistance 
as additional needs become evident.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the release of emergency funds for California earthquake recovery and 
other recent disasters.
