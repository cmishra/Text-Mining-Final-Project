Statement on the Death of Chaim Herzog
April 17, 1997

    I was informed this morning that former Israeli President Chaim 
Herzog had died after a long illness. I offer my heartfelt condolences 
to his family and to the people of Israel. Chaim Herzog not only served 
the Israeli people with distinction as their President for 10 years, he 
was a courageous soldier in the liberation of Europe and a distinguished 
leader in the Israeli armed forces. He will long be remembered for his 
years as a statesman and scholar--he personified a vibrant, emerging 
Israel, taking its place in the community of nations.
