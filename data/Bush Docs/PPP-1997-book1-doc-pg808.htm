Statement on the Death of Betty Shabazz
June 23, 1997

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the passing of Betty Shabazz 
earlier today. She devoted a long career to education and to uplifting 
women and children. She was also a loving mother. Our prayers are with 
her family in this hour of grief.
