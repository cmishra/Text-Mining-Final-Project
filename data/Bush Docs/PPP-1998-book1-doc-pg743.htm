Statement on Senate Action on Agricultural Research Legislation
May 12, 1998

    I am very pleased that the Senate today passed with an overwhelming 
majority the bipartisan conference report on the agriculture research 
bill. This vital legislation makes needed reforms and provides funding 
in several areas that are priorities for my administration. The 
legislation provides important benefits to America's farmers and to 
those who have come to this country seeking a brighter future. I would 
like to extend my warm gratitude to Senators Lugar<Lugar, Richard 
G.<ls-thn-eq> and Harkin<Harkin, Tom<ls-thn-eq> for their vision and 
hard work stewarding a bill that ably balances crop insurance, 
agriculture research, rural development, and Food Stamps for legal 
immigrants in need.
    The last hurdle that remains for this bill is for the House of 
Representatives to pass the conference report. I urge the House to act 
quickly on this legislation.
