Statement on Congressional Action on Health Care Reform
June 23, 1994

    Under the leadership of Chairman Ford, the decisive action by the 
members of the House Education and Labor Committee has brought us one 
step closer to achieving our goal of universal coverage: guaranteed 
private insurance for every American that can never be taken away.
    Chairman Ford has had a long, distinguished career in Congress, and 
his guidance throughout the health care reform process and his 
commitment to universal coverage will help us ensure that all Americans 
have the health security they want and deserve.
    With today's action, for the first time ever, a committee in each 
House of Congress has reported a bill that guarantees universal 
coverage. They have broken the chokehold of special interests and, by 
choosing to cover everyone, have stood up instead for millions of hard 
working middle class Americans.
    As we continue to move forward, and as momentum for reform builds, 
this committee action sends a clear signal to the American people that 
Congress is well on its way to making health care history this year.
