Statement on Signing the Coastal Zone Protection Act of 1996
June 3, 1996

    I have today signed into law H.R. 1965, the ``Coastal Zone 
Protection Act of 1996.'' This legislation will continue support for 
programs under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) that 
balance coastal development with resource conservation.
    The CZMA's voluntary Federal-State coastal management programs 
protect natural resources, stimulate coastal economic development, and 
help save lives and property. The programs also provide for monitoring 
of coastal conditions and research to address resource management 
issues.
    Through their balanced approach and focus on Federal-State 
partnerships, CZMA programs have enjoyed bipartisan support throughout 
their 24-year history. The enactment of H.R. 1965 demonstrates our 
Nation's resolve to keep our coasts clean, healthy, and productive for 
generations to come.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

June 3, 1996.

Note: H.R. 1965, approved June 3, was assigned Public Law No. 104-150. 
This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on June 
4.
