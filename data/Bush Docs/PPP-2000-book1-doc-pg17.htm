Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Iraq's 
Compliance With United Nations Security Council Resolutions
January 7, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) and as part of my effort to keep the 
Congress fully informed, I am reporting on the status of efforts to 
obtain Iraq's compliance with the resolutions adopted by the United 
Nations Security Council. My last report, consistent with Public Law 
102-1, was transmitted on October 1, 1999. I shall continue to keep the 
Congress informed about this important issue.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on January 
10.
