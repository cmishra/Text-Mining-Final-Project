Statement on the Death of Canadian Troops in Afghanistan
April 18, 2002

    All Americans are deeply saddened by the deaths yesterday of four 
brave Canadian military personnel in Afghanistan and by the injuries 
sustained by eight others. I immediately expressed to Prime Minister 
Chretien<Chretien, Jean> my deepest sorrow and sympathy at 
this tragic accident. Canada's fallen heroes and their families are in 
our hearts and prayers.
    Canada is a vital member of a mighty coalition against terrorism and 
hatred. It is shouldering great burdens and making

tremendous sacrifices to make the world a safer place for all people. It 
is doing so in defense of the values that define the Canadian nation and 
that unite our two peoples.
    As I told the Prime Minister,<Chretien, Jean> we will work 
together with Canada in a thorough and timely investigation to determine 
exactly how yesterday's tragedy in Afghanistan occurred. We will draw 
every possible lesson from what happened and do everything we can to 
protect coalition forces engaged in this vitally important mission.
