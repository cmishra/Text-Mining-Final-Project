Message on the Observance of Eid al-Adha
December 8, 2008

    I send greetings to Muslims around the world celebrating Eid al-
Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice.
    Eid al-Adha commemorates Abraham's devotion to God, and it reminds 
us of God's mercy and provision for his people. Abraham's deep faith was 
tested when God asked him to sacrifice his son. Although Abraham was set 
to faithfully obey, God provided an alternate sacrifice that spared his 
son. During this holiday, Muslims around the world honor Abraham's trust 
in God and celebrate God's love through acts of charity and joyous 
feasts with family, friends, and others in their community.
    Our Nation is blessed by vibrant Muslim communities. On this 
holiday, all Americans celebrate our religious liberty, and we remember 
that religious freedom belongs not to any one nation but to the world.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a 
blessed holiday.

                                                          George W. Bush
