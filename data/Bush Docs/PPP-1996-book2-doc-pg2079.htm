thoughts are also with Mrs. Yeltsin and the Yeltsin family.
    We are pleased to see the reports that the surgery was a success. I 
have spoken with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, who confirmed that the 
operation went well, and who expressed gratitude for the assistance 
provided to the Russian doctors by Dr. DeBakey and his team.
    Over the last 4 years, the United States and Russia have taken 
important steps to build a safer, more peaceful world. We look forward 
to continuing the close work between our two countries as we lay the 
foundation for a bright new century.
