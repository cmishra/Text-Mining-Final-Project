Letter to National Bioethics Advisory Commission Chair Harold Shapiro on 
Cloning Technology Issues
February 24, 1997

Dear Dr. Shapiro:
    As you know, it was reported today that researchers have developed 
techniques to clone sheep. This represents a remarkable scientific 
discovery, but one that raises important questions. While this 
technological advance could offer potential benefits in such areas as 
medical research and agriculture, it also raises serious ethical 
questions, particularly with respect to the possible use of this 
technology to clone human embryos.
    Therefore, I request that the National Bioethics Advisory Commission 
undertake a thorough review of the legal and ethical issues associated 
with the use of this technology, and report back to me within ninety 
days with recommendations on possible federal actions to prevent its 
abuse.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton
