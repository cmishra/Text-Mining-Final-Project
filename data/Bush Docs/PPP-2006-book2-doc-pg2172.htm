Statement on Congressional Passage of United States-India Civil Nuclear 
Cooperation Legislation
December 9, 2006

    Congress has agreed upon bipartisan legislation that will strengthen 
the strategic relationship between America and India and deliver 
valuable benefits to both nations. I am pleased that our two countries 
will soon have increased opportunities to work together to meet our 
energy needs in a manner that does not increase air pollution and 
greenhouse gas emissions, promotes clean development, supports 
nonproliferation, and advances our trade interests.
    I appreciate Congress's support for the U.S.-India civil nuclear 
cooperation initiative and would like to thank Chairman Hyde,<Hyde, 
Henry J.<ls-thn-eq> Ranking Member Lantos,<Lantos, Thomas P.<ls-thn-eq> 
Chairman Lugar,<Lugar, Richard Green<ls-thn-eq> and Ranking Member 
Biden<Biden, Joseph R., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> for their leadership on this 
extraordinary legislation. I look forward to signing this bill into law 
soon.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 5682.
