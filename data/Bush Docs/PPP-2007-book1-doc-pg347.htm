Remarks on White House Press Secretary Tony Snow<Snow, Tony<ls-thn-eq>
March 27, 2007

    This morning I got a phone call from Tony Snow. He called me from 
the hospital. He told me that when they went in and operated on him, 
they found cancer. It's a recurrence of the cancer that he thought that 
he had successfully dealt with in the past. His attitude is, one, that 
he is not going to let this whip him, and he's upbeat. My attitude is, 
is that we need to pray for him and for his family.
    Obviously, a lot of folks here in the White House worry a lot about 
their friend, as do Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I. And so my 
message to Tony is, stay strong; a lot of people love you and care for 
you and will pray for you. And we're hoping for all the best. I'm 
looking forward to the day that he comes back to the White House and 
briefs the press corps on the decisions that I'm making and why I'm 
making them. In the meantime, I hope our fellow citizens offer a prayer 
to he and his family.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:54 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House.
