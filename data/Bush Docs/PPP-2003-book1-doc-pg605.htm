Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation To Ban 
Partial-Birth Abortion
June 4, 2003

    I applaud the House for passing legislation banning partial-birth 
abortions. Passage of this important legislation is a shared priority 
that will help build a culture of life in America. I urge Congress to 
quickly resolve any differences and send me the final bill as soon as 
possible so that I can sign it into law.
