Statement on Congressional Passage of Outer Continental Shelf 
Legislation
December 9, 2006

    I commend Congress for passing the Outer Continental Shelf 
legislation, which will help to reduce our dependence on imported 
sources of energy by increasing access to domestic sources of oil and 
gas. Developing these reliable domestic resources in an environmentally 
sound manner will help address high energy prices, strengthen our energy 
security, and protect manufacturing jobs. The bill also provides the 
producing States of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama a share 
in the royalty revenues from OCS leases. I appreciate the commitment by 
the State of Louisiana to use revenues from these leases to restore 
coastal wetlands.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 6111.
