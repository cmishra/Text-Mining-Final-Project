Vancouver
April 3, 1993

Russia-U.S. Relations

    Q. President Yeltsin, will American aid make a difference to the 
political situation in Russia?
    President Yeltsin. You know, it's always useful to help a friend, 
especially if a friend goes through a difficult period. And we are 
partners, and we are friends.
    Q. Go ahead, Mr. President, you can talk.
    President Clinton. I just was going to say, I don't view this as a--
this is not a talk about aid; this is a talk about a long-term 
partnership. The United States has a great deal to gain from a strong, 
successful, democratic Russia. It is in our interest. And I'm very 
encouraged by the things that President Yeltsin has stood for, and the 
fight that he's waging now.
    President Yeltsin. And the rest of the world, too.

Note: The exchange began at 1:55 p.m. at the MacKenzie House at the 
University of British Columbia. President Yeltsin spoke in Russian, and 
his remarks were translated by an interpreter. A tape was not available
