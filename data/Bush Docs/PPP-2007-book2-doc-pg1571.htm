Remarks on Signing a Bill To Prevent Taxation of Payments From the Hokie 
Spirit Memorial Fund to Virginia Tech Victims and Families
December 19, 2007

    It's my honor to welcome the president<Steger, Charles W.<ls-thn-eq> 
of Virginia Tech, the mayor<Rordam, Ron<ls-thn-eq> of Blacksburg, the 
Governor<Kaine, Timothy M.<ls-thn-eq> of the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
and of course, distinguished members

of the congressional delegation here as I sign a bill that's going to 
help the folks who suffered mightily on that day when a gunman killed 
their loved ones. It's a good piece of legislation. I appreciate members 
from both parties working on it.
    And I asked the president<Steger, Charles W.<ls-thn-eq> how--what 
the spirits are like there at Virginia Tech, and he said they're strong. 
And I'm not surprised. Having been there for that memorial ceremony, I 
left with the distinct impression that of all the communities in America 
that could deal with a tragedy, it's the Virginia Tech community.
    And so I want to say to the families who still suffer, we think 
about you. And to the students and faculty and alumni and leadership of 
Virginia Tech, thank you for helping those who suffer reconcile and 
recover from the grief they feel. So it's my honor to sign this 
important piece of legislation.

Note: The President spoke at 11:37 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Charles W. Steger, president, 
Virginia Tech University; Mayor Ron Rordam of Blacksburg, VA; and Gov. 
Timothy M. Kaine of Virginia. H.R. 4118, approved December 19, was 
assigned Public Law No. 110-141.
