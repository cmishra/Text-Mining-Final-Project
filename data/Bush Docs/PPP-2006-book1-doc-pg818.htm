Statement on the Framework Agreement With Canada on Softwood Lumber 
Trade
April 27, 2006

    I am pleased that the United States and Canada concluded a framework 
agreement today to resolve the long-standing dispute on softwood lumber 
trade. This agreement shows how NAFTA partners can overcome differences 
and work together. The United States close ties with our good friend and 
northern neighbor made this agreement possible. I applaud Prime Minister 
Harper's<Harper, Stephen J.<ls-thn-eq> leadership in resolving this 
issue, and I am grateful to the lead negotiators on both sides, 
Ambassador Susan C. Schwab<Schwab, Susan C.<ls-thn-eq> for the United 
States and Ambassador Michael Wilson<Wilson, Michael<ls-thn-eq> of 
Canada.
