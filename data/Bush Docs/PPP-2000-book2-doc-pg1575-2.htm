Statement on the Anniversary of the United States Embassy Bombings in 
Kenya and Tanzania
August 7, 2000

    I join all Americans in remembering the lives lost 2 years ago today 
in the bombing of our Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Twelve 
dedicated Americans perished on that day, together with 44 Kenyan and 
Tanzanian citizens working to support our diplomatic efforts, and more 
than 200 other innocent people. The targets of this crime were doing so 
much good: helping Africans and each other to promote peace and 
democracy, to fight poverty and disease, to protect the environment, and 
to aid American citizens in need. I believe they were targets precisely 
because they were dedicated to principles of tolerance, understanding, 
and

cooperation across frontiers. The terrorists took from us our 
colleagues, friends, and loved ones, but they have failed utterly to 
deter us from advancing these principles around the world.
    Today we remember that, in many ways, the men and women who serve 
America in our diplomatic missions endure as much danger and hardship as 
the men and women who serve America in our military. As long as the 
world is as it is, we cannot eliminate the risk. But we can and must 
give them the support they need to minimize that risk, and the backing 
they deserve to achieve America's goals in the world.
