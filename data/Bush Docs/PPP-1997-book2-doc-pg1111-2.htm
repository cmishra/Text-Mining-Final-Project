August 18, 1997

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    As required by section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 
2785), I transmit herewith the first annual report on the implementation 
of a comprehensive program to monitor the end-use of defense articles 
and services, and to prevent the diversion of technology incorporated in 
defense articles, sold, leased, or exported under the Arms Export 
Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et 
seq.).
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives,
