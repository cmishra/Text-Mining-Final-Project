Letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James L. Witt on 
Disaster Assistance for California
January 17, 1994

Dear Mr. Witt:
    I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of 
California, resulting from an earthquake and aftershocks on January 17, 
1994, and continuing, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant 
a major disaster declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, 
therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of 
California.
    In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to 
allocate from funds available for these purposes, such amounts as you 
find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative 
expenses.
    You are authorized to provide Individual Assistance and Public 
Assistance in the designated areas. Consistent with the requirement that 
Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the 
Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the 
total eligible costs except for direct Federal assistance costs for 
emergency work authorized at 100 percent Federal funding for the first 
72 hours.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This letter was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary but was not issued as a White House press release.
