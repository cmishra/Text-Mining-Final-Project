Remarks on the Unveiling of the September 11th United States Postage 
Stamp
March 11, 2002

    The President. Welcome. We're about to unveil a stamp. It's an 
extraordinary piece of work. I want to thank the photographer<Franklin, 
Thomas E.> here, and I want to thank Gary Ackerman<Ackerman, 
Gary L.> for sponsoring it. This stamp will sell for 45 cents; 
11 cents, obviously, more than the current price of a stamp. Eight cents 
will go to a victims fund to help those family members who are 
struggling in the aftermath of 9/11. It is a--it's a good gesture by the 
Postal Service. The Postmaster General<Potter, John E.> is 
here, and I want to thank you for that very much.
    Postmaster General John E. Potter.<Potter, John E.> Thank 
you, Mr. President.

the Postal Service to use you as a way to help our Nation remember the 
terrible incident that took place 6 months ago and help people get their 
lives back in order.
    And so it's with pleasure that we reveal the stamp.
