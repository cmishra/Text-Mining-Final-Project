Statement on Senate Confirmation of Judges for the United States Courts 
of Appeals and District Courts
June 25, 2008

    Yesterday the Senate confirmed Raymond Kethledge<Kethledge, Raymond 
M.<ls-thn-eq> and Helene White<White, Helene N.<ls-thn-eq> to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and Stephen Murphy<Murphy, 
Stephen J., III<ls-thn-eq> to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of Michigan. I appreciate the Senate's work on filling these 
important seats, which had been declared judicial emergencies.
    For the first time in my administration, the Sixth Circuit will now 
have a full court to address important issues facing the residents of 
Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. Unfortunately, too many other 
Federal judgeships across America remain vacant. This is unacceptable 
and inexcusable. Since the beginning of the 110th Congress, the Senate 
has confirmed only 10 circuit court nominees. In the last 2 years of the 
past three administrations, the Senate has confirmed an average of 17 
circuit court judges. I strongly urge the Senate to hold hearings and 
votes on the 28 pending circuit and district court nominations to ensure 
that our Nation has a fully functioning judicial system.
