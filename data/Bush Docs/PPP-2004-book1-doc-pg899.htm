Statement on Establishing the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force
May 18, 2004

    The Great Lakes are a national treasure that represents 20 percent 
of the world's fresh water. The Great Lakes region is an economic engine 
and recreational haven, and we are making great progress in protecting 
and restoring this vital natural resource.
    To build on that progress, today I am establishing the Great Lakes 
Interagency Task Force, chaired by EPA Administrator Mike 
Leavitt.<Leavitt, Michael O.<ls-thn-eq> The Task Force will address 
environmental and natural resource issues of national concern and better 
coordinate the region's sustainable development and restoration. It will 
harness the collective efforts of the Federal Government, Governors, 
mayors, Members of Congress, tribes, and citizen stewards to ensure that 
the greatness of the lakes endures for generations. The Task Force will 
also consult with the Government of Canada on the most effective way 
forward on addressing past and current environmental impacts to the 
Great Lakes ecology.

Note: The Executive order on establishment of the Task Force is listed 
in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
