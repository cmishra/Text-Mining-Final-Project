Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Premier Wen Jiabao<Wen Jiabao<ls-thn-eq> 
of China in Beijing
August 10, 2008

    Premier Wen. Mr. President, welcome to Beijing. I also welcome your 
family members and other friends from the United States to the Beijing 
Olympic Games.
    I already learned that yesterday you went to see the American 
athletes in Beijing and you also watched a match played by the U.S. 
women's basketball team.
    President Bush.  Right.
    Premier Wen.  You also spent some time with the beach volleyball 
players. [Laughter]
    I think this evening the match between the Chinese men's basketball 
team and the American men's basketball team will captivate the attention 
of people from all over the world.
    President Bush. That's right.
    Premier Wen. I'm very happy that you're going to watch the match.
    President Bush. Yes, sir. I'm going with the Foreign Minister.<Yang 
Jiechi<ls-thn-eq> [Laughter] He's going--he told me he's going to be 
yelling at the top of his lungs. [Laughter]
    Thank you for your hospitality. It's been a wonderful experience 
being here. I didn't see if you were at the opening ceremonies.
    Premier Wen. Yes, I was there.
    President Bush. Well, it was fantastic--really well done. But thank 
you.
    Premier Wen. Yes, the opening ceremony is spectacular.
    President Bush. Unbelievable.
    Premier Wen. When the U.S. team marched into the stadium, I saw that 
you put back your coat and your suit and then you stood up and cheered 
for your team.
    President Bush. Yes, sir. I was proud to see them. But I bet you did 
the same thing when the Chinese team came. [Laughter]
    Premier Wen. Yes, yes. I did the same.
