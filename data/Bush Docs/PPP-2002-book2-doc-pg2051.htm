Statement on Signing the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002
November 7, 2002

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 4685, a bill to amend title 31, 
United States Code, to expand the types of Federal agencies that are 
required to prepare audited financial statements.
    The executive branch shall construe the terms ``agency,'' 
``executive agency,'' and ``covered executive agency'' as used in the 
legislation in a manner consistent with the separation of powers 
principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 in Franklin v. 
Massachusetts; the principle of construction relating to section 552 of 
title 5 set forth by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia Circuit in 1993 in Meyer v. Bush; and the principle of 
construction relating to section 112 of title 3 set forth by the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1995 in Haddon 
v. Walters.

                                                          George W. Bush

The White House,

November 7, 2002.

Note: H.R. 4685, approved November 7, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
289.
