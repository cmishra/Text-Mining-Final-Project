Statement on Senate Confirmation of Porter J. Goss<Goss, Porter 
J.<ls-thn-eq> as Director of Central Intelligence
September 22, 2004

    I am very pleased that a strong bipartisan majority in the U.S. 
Senate today voted to confirm Porter Goss as the next Director of 
Central Intelligence. Porter Goss is a leader with strong experience in 
intelligence and in the fight against terrorism. He is the right man to 
take on the essential mission of leading the CIA at this critical moment 
in our Nation's history as we face the challenges and the dangerous 
threats of this century. I look forward to his counsel as we implement 
intelligence reform, including the recommendations of the 9/11 
Commission.
