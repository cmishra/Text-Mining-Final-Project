    President Bush. Mr. President, thank you very much for your 
hospitality. This is a good start to a very important series of 
discussions. It is an honor to be here with the Prime Minister of Canada 
as well. We've got vital relations that will matter to the future of our 
people. And I look forward to the discussions.
    And I want to thank you for letting us begin our very important 
meetings at this very significant historical site. And I congratulate 
our guide,<Sodi, Federica<ls-thn-eq> and I want to thank those who have 
worked hard to make sure this important part of history is accessible 
and is available for people to understand the past, so we can better 
understand the future.
    So, Mr. President, thank you for having us.

    Prime Minister Harper. And I can repeat the same thing quickly, if 
you don't mind. Forgive us; that's how we speak Spanish in the north. 
[Laughter] Wonderful to be here. Thank you for the welcome, President 
Fox. I think we stand here in a historic site, a symbol here of our 
determination to build a new future for all inhabitants of North 
America. And I am honored to be with President Bush and President Fox 
and look forward to our discussions.
    President Bush. Gracias, senor.
    President Fox. Bienvenidos.

Note: The President spoke at 11:15 a.m.
