Joint Statement by President George W. Bush and<Putin, 
Vladimir> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Afghanistan
November 13, 2001

    We express our continued support for the people of Afghanistan in 
their effort to establish a government that can bring peace and 
stability to Afghanistan, close down terrorist camps, and end 
Afghanistan's use as a platform for international terrorists. We agree 
that a new Afghan government should adhere to accepted international 
principles, respect human rights, including those of women and girls, 
facilitate delivery of aid to combat the current humanitarian crisis, 
and rebuild Afghanistan and the region economically.
    The United States and Russia do not intend to, and cannot, create 
the future government of Afghanistan. It is up to the Afghans themselves 
to determine their future. We believe that, in order for any future 
government to bring peace to the people of Afghanistan and promote 
stability in the region, it must be broad-based, represent all Afghans, 
men and women, and be drawn from all ethnic groups. We agree that the 
Taliban as a movement should have no place in future bodies of state 
power in Afghanistan.
    We welcome the appointment of<Brahimi, Lakhdar> Ambassador 
Lakhdar Brahimi as the United Nations Secretary General's Special 
Representative for Afghanistan and underscore our support for his 
efforts to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan and the region.
