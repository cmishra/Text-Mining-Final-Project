Statement on the Death of Joseph Serna, Jr.<Serna, Joseph, 
Jr.>
November 7, 1999

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Mayor 
Joe Serna earlier today. Joe was an extraordinary public servant, 
educator, father, husband, and friend. He was a great leader of 
Sacramento and a source of inspiration to the Hispanic community and all 
Americans. Our Nation has lost a remarkable man. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his family.
