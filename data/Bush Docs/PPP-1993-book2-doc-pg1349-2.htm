District of Arkansas.
    ``There are few things that I will do that will have more lasting 
effect than the appointment of Federal judges,'' said the President. 
``Along with Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court and the many other 
judges yet to be named, this outstanding group of jurists will change 
the face of the Federal courts and help move our country forward.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
