To the Congress of the United States:

of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This action allowed

of most-favored-nation (MFN) status for Mongolia and certain other 
activities without the requirement of an annual waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the 
Congress concerning the emigration laws and policies of Mongolia. You 
will find that the report indicates continued Mongolian compliance with 
U.S. and international standards in the area of emigration.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
