Statement on Senate Action on Legislation To Combat Terrorism
October 12, 2001

    I commend the Senate for acting quickly and in a bipartisan way to 
give law enforcement these essential, additional tools to combat 
terrorism and safeguard America against future terrorist attacks. This 
important legislation respects our Constitution while allowing us to 
treat terrorist acts the same as serious drug crimes and organized 
crime, and strengthens our ability to share information to disrupt, 
weaken, and eliminate global terrorist networks. We need these tools 
now. I am hopeful that I will be able to sign this legislation into law 
soon.
