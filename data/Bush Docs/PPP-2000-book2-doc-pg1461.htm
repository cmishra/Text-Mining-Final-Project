Message to the Senate Transmitting Optional Protocols to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child
July 25, 2000

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith two optional protocols to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, both of which were adopted at New 
York, May 25, 2000: (1) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict; and 
(2) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. I 
signed both Protocols on July 5, 2000.
    In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to both Protocols, 
including article-by-article analyses of each Protocol. As detailed in 
the Department of State report, a number of understandings and 
declarations are recommended.
    These Protocols represent a true breakthrough for the children of 
the world. Ratification of these Protocols will enhance the ability of 
the United States to provide global leadership in the effort to 
eliminate abuses against children with respect to armed conflict and 
sexual exploitation.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to both Protocols and give its advice and consent to the ratification of 
both Protocols, subject to the understandings and declarations 
recommended in the Department of State Report.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 25, 2000.
