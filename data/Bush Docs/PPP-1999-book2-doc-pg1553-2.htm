Message on the Observance of Yom Kippur, 1999
September 17, 1999

    I am pleased to send warm greetings to all those observing Yom 
Kippur.
    On this most solemn of holy days, Jews across our nation and around 
the world prepare for the new year through fasting, prayer, and quiet 
reflection. Examining their thoughts, words, and deeds of the past year, 
they strive to acknowledge and learn from their transgressions, seek 
forgiveness from those whom they may have offended, and ask for God's 
mercy.
    This Day of Atonement can offer a powerful lesson to people of all 
faiths about the true spirit of reconciliation and the unconditional 
love of God. It can teach us not only to face our own failures, but also 
to love and forgive one another as God loves and forgives us. As the 
Jewish people set aside this time to repair their relationships and 
renew their souls, let us all vow to work together to heal divisions, 
promote tolerance and understanding, and share the blessings of peace in 
the year to come.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a meaningful 
Yom Kippur.

                                                            Bill Clinton
