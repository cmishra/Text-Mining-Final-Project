Statement on the Whale Sanctuary Agreement
May 27, 1994

    We are pleased that we were able to get so many other countries to 
agree to a sanctuary. The United States will continue to exercise 
leadership in seeking international agreement on the conservation of 
whales.

Note: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary 
on the International Whaling Commission agreement to create a sanctuary 
for whales.
