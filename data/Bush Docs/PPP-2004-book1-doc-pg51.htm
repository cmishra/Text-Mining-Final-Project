Remarks Prior to Discussions With President Ricardo Lagos<Lagos, 
Ricardo<ls-thn-eq> of Chile in Monterrey
January 12, 2004

    President Bush. Listen, I'm honored to be here with el Presidente de 
Chile, Ricardo Lagos. Mr. President, thank you for your leadership and 
friendship. We have had a very close working relationship. And the 
people of the world should take notice of the fact that Chile and 
America negotiated and finalized a free trade agreement, a free trade 
agreement which is in the interests of the people of America and the 
people of Chile. It's an example of the bilateral trade relationships 
that my Government thinks is important.
    But beyond that, we've got a relationship based upon shared values. 
The President is a strong leader who believes in human dignity and human 
rights and in freedom. And for that, Mr. President, I'm grateful for 
your strong voice here in our neighborhood. It's good to see you again, 
sir. Thank you. You're looking good these days.

[At this point, President Lagos spoke in Spanish, and no translation was 
provided. He then continued in English.]
