Statement on Senate Action on the Dominican Republic-Central America-
United States Free Trade Agreement
June 30, 2005

    I appreciate the bipartisan support in the United States Senate for 
the CAFTA-DR agreement, which is good for American workers, good for our 
farmers, and good for small businesses. When passed, it will eliminate 
trade barriers immediately on 80 percent of U.S.-made goods and the rest 
within a few years, which will help increase sales abroad and job 
creation at home. The agreement is also a strong boost for young 
democracies in our own hemisphere, whose success is important for 
America's national security and for reducing illegal immigration.

Note: The statement referred to S. 1307.
