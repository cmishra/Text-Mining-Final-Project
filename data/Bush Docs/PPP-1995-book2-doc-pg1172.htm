Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Iraq
July 28, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Iraqi emergency is to continue in 
effect beyond August 2, 1995, to the Federal Register for publication.
    The crisis between the United States and Iraq that led to the 
declaration on August 2, 1990, of a national emergency has not been 
resolved. The Government of Iraq continues to engage in activities 
inimical to stability in the Middle East and hostile to United States 
interest in the region. Such Iraqi actions pose a continuing unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign policy 
interests of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined 
that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities 
necessary to apply economic pressure on the Government of Iraq.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 28, 1995.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
