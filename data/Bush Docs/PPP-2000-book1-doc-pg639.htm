Statement on the Conclusion of the Independent Counsel's Investigation 
of Alexis Herman<Herman, Alexis M.<ls-thn-eq>
April 5, 2000

    I am very pleased to learn that Independent Counsel Ralph 
Lancaster<Lancaster, Ralph<ls-thn-eq> has concluded his investigation. 
Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman has for many years served our Nation 
with selfless dedication and extraordinary talent. She did not deserve 
what she has had to endure over the past many months. As I said at the 
start of this inquiry, nearly 2 years ago, Secretary Herman did nothing 
wrong. But throughout it all, she was never deterred from her mission: 
making life better for America's working families. I am proud to call 
her my friend, and I am honored that she has been willing to work in 
this administration on behalf of working people everywhere.
