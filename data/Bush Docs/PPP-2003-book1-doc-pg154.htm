Message on the Observance of Eid al-Adha
January 27, 2003

    I send greetings to Muslims in the United States and around the 
world as you celebrate the Eid al-Adha holiday.
    The Qur'an teaches that the sacred feast of Eid al-Adha is a time 
for Muslims to join family and friends in thanking the Almighty for His 
many blessings and to reflect on the great sacrifice and devotion of 
Abraham. During this festive celebration, peace-loving people around the 
world, including millions of American Muslims, honor Abraham's example 
by sharing love and demonstrating compassion for those in need.
    This year's celebration comes at a time when our world faces great 
challenges and important opportunities. The United States remains 
committed to promoting justice, tolerance, and understanding through-out 
the world, and we will continue to work together with our Muslim friends 
and people of all faiths to build a future of peace, freedom, and 
opportunity for all.
    Laura<Bush, Laura> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a joyous celebration.

                                                          George W. Bush
