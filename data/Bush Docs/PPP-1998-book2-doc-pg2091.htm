Radio Remarks on Disaster Relief for Central America
November 25, 1998

    Throughout this week, families in the United States are coming 
together to give thanks for the blessings we enjoy. As we celebrate, we 
must remember our neighbors, particularly the people in Central America 
whose lives were devastated by Hurricane Mitch a month ago.
    The Americas are also a family, and many relatives of our own 
citizens live in the nations hardest hit by the hurricane: Honduras, 
Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The United States has already 
pledged $263 million to the relief effort, offering food, loans, and 
vital health services. Our Armed Forces are on the scene transporting 
supplies, rebuilding roads and communities. The First Lady and Tipper 
Gore visited the region and renewed our pledge to do all we can to help.
    So this Thanksgiving I ask you to keep the hurricane victims in your 
thoughts and prayers and to continue your generous donation to relief 
organizations. In this season of need, we will not let down our fellow 
Americans.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 5:40 p.m. 
on November 23 in the Oval Office at the White House for broadcast on 
November 25. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on November 25.
