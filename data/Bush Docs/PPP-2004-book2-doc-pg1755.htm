Statement on Facilitation of Cooperative Conservation
August 26, 2004

    Americans have a long tradition of conservation and stewardship of 
our Nation's lands and other natural resources. It was this ethic that 
led 30 years ago to passage of landmark legislation that continues to 
help improve America's water and air quality. Over the last three 
decades, we have made remarkable progress, working together to meet our 
conservation goals and improve the quality of our air and water.
    Today I have directed the Federal agencies that oversee 
environmental and natural resource policies and programs to promote 
cooperative conservation in full partnership with States, local 
governments, tribes, and individuals. Local involvement is critical to 
ensuring successful, effective, and long-lasting conservation results. 
The Executive order on cooperative conservation that I have signed today 
will help us continue to make sure that decisions in Washington, DC, are 
well-informed by those closest to the land and their communities.

Note: The Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
