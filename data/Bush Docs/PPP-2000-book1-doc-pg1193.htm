Statement on Senate Action on Hate Crimes Legislation
June 20, 2000

    Today the Senate held a historic and long-overdue vote on hate 
crimes legislation. I applaud the Senate for passing this crucial 
measure, and recognize the efforts of Senator Kennedy<Kennedy, Edward 
M.<ls-thn-eq> on this important issue. This amendment recognizes that 
hate crimes are different from other crimes. When Americans are targeted 
just because of who they are--whether

[[Page 1194]]

because of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual 
orientation, or disability--they hurt more. These crimes affect entire 
communities and strike at the heart of our American system of values. 
This important legislation sends a message that everyone is protected 
under the law.
    This legislation also recognizes that State and local law 
enforcement still have primary responsibility for investigating and 
prosecuting hate crimes. It provides much needed assistance for State 
and local law enforcement agencies. It provides financial assistance 
through grants and help with investigations and prosecutions so that 
Federal, State, and local law enforcement can work together to ensure 
that perpetrators of hate crimes are brought to justice. In addition, 
the legislation ensures that Federal law enforcement officers confer 
with State and local law enforcement before bringing a case in Federal 
court.
    Today a majority of the Senate has spoken. We must all work together 
to ensure that this amendment is not removed during conference. I urge 
all Members of Congress to send me this legislation to sign into law.
