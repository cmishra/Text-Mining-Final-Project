Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Zimbabwe
March 4, 2008

To the Congress of the United States:
    The crisis constituted by the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions has not been resolved. 
These actions and policies pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I 
have determined that it is necessary to continue this national emergency 
and to maintain in force the sanctions to respond to this threat.
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of 
certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to 
undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions is to continue 
in effect beyond March 6, 2008.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 March 4, 2008.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
