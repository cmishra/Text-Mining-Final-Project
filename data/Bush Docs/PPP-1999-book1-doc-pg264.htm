Radio Remarks on the Kennedy-Murray Amendment to Proposed Education 
Flexibility Partnership Legislation
February 25, 1999

    This year, we have a remarkable opportunity to work together across 
party lines to bring true progress to America's public schools. I 
welcome the idea of greater flexibility for States and school districts, 
and I urge the Senate to pass the so-called ed-flex legislation, because 
it provides for greater flexibility and greater accountability. But we 
must do more to give our children a world-class education. That's why I 
also strongly support the amendment to the legislation proposed by 
Senators Kennedy<Kennedy, Edward M.> and Murray<Murray, 
Patty> to continue the national commitment we began last year: 
to hire 100,000 new teachers and to reduce class size all across 
America. Studies confirm what every parent already knows: smaller 
classes make a big difference, from improved test scores to improved 
discipline. The Senate should pass the Kennedy-Murray amendment and give 
our Nation's children the individual attention they deserve in the 
classroom and the better future only a good education can bring.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 2 p.m. in 
the Tucson Convention Center in Tucson, AZ, for later broadcast. These 
remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office Radio 
Actuality Line.
