Director Larry Lindsey<Lindsey, Larry<ls-thn-eq>
December 6, 2002

    My economic team has worked with me to craft and implement an 
economic agenda that helped to lead the Nation out of recession and back 
into a period of growth. I appreciate Paul O'Neill's and Larry Lindsey's 
important contributions to making this happen. Both are highly talented 
and dedicated, and they have served my administration and our Nation 
well. I thank them for their excellent service.
