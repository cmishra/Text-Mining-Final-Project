Message to the Senate Transmitting the Dominican Republic-United States 
Stolen Vehicle Treaty
September 8, 1999

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of 
the United States of America and the Government of the Dominican 
Republic for the Return of Stolen or Embezzled Vehicles, with Annexes, 
signed at Santo Domingo on April 30, 1996. I transmit also, for the 
information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with 
respect to the Treaty.
    The Treaty is one of a series of stolen vehicles treaties being 
negotiated by the United States in order to eliminate the difficulties 
faced by owners of vehicles that have been stolen and transported across 
international borders. When it enters into force, it will be an 
effective tool to facilitate the return of U.S. vehicles that have been 
stolen or embezzled and taken to the Dominican Republic.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty, with Annexes, and give its advice and consent to 
ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

September 8, 1999.
