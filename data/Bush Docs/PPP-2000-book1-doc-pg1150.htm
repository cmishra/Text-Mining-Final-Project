Statement on the Korean Summit
June 15, 2000

    The historic summit between President Kim Dae-jung<Kim Dae-
jung<ls-thn-eq> and Chairman Kim Chong-il<Kim Chong-il<ls-thn-eq> marks 
an initial, hopeful step toward peace and reconciliation on the Korean 
Peninsula. I welcome the agreements the two leaders reached on 
humanitarian and economic cooperation and on a future summit in Seoul, 
and hope that both sides will continue down this promising path. I 
applaud Kim Dae-jung's persistence and wisdom as he has moved, soberly 
and realistically, to improve relations with the North. President Kim 
and I have consulted very closely on this issue, and I look forward to 
supporting his future initiatives toward lasting peace and full 
reconciliation.
