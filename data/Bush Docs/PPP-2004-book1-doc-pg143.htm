Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
January 27, 2004

Legislative Agenda

    I want to thank the Members from the Senate and the House who are 
here, both Republicans and Democrat leaders who are here to discuss the 
upcoming session. We've got a lot of common interests this year, 
interests of continuing to fight and win the war against terror. We need 
to protect our homeland. We need to put policies in place that help 
people find work. We'll work together on the health needs of our fellow 
citizens. We've got to be wise with the people's money. I look forward 
to constructive conversation today and working together constructively 
throughout the year. This is an election year. It's a year where people 
say, ``Nothing can get done.'' We need to prove them wrong. We need to 
continue to do the people's business in a sound way.
    I want to thank the Members for coming. I appreciate the chance to 
visit with you, and I look forward to a good relationship here in 2004.

Note: The President spoke at 3:34 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
