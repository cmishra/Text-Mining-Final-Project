Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Mumbai, India
July 11, 2006

    On behalf of the American people, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
send our deepest condolences to the friends and families of the victims 
of today's brutal attacks on commuter rail passengers in Mumbai. The 
United States stands with the people and the Government of India and 
condemns in the strongest terms these atrocities, which were committed 
against innocent people as they went about their daily lives. Such acts 
only strengthen the resolve of the international community to stand 
united against terrorism and to declare unequivocally that there is no 
justification for the vicious murder of innocent people.
