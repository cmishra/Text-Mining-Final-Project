    I thank Captain Pucciarelli<Pucciarelli, George W.<ls-thn-eq> for 
the fine invocation. He is not devoid of a sense of humor; before we 
came out here, he said he was going out to offer the exorcism. 
[Laughter]
    To those who lived through World War II and those who grew up in the 
years that followed, few memories inspire more awe and horror than the 
battle for Okinawa. In the greatest conflict the world has ever known, 
our forces fought no engagement more bitter or more bloody. In 82 days 
of fighting, America suffered more than 12,000 dead in this final epic 
battle, the most costly one during the entire Pacific war.
    At the very heart of this crucible was the fight for a hill called 
Sugar Loaf, the key to breaking the enemy's line across the south of the 
island, some of the grimmest combat our forces had ever seen. The 
marines on Sugar Loaf faced a hail of artillery, mortars, and grenades. 
They were raked by constant machinegun fire. Time and again, our men 
would claw their way uphill only to be repulsed by the enemy. Progress 
was measured by the yard.
    On May 14th, 1945, a 19-year-old corporal named Jim Day led several 
other marines to a shell crater on the slope of Sugar Loaf. What 
happened then surpasses our powers of imagination. On the first day in 
that isolated hole, Corporal Day and those with him fought off an 
advance by scores of enemy soldiers. That night he helped to repel three 
more assaults, as those with him fell dead or injured. Braving heavy 
fire, he escorted four wounded comrades, one by one, to safety. But he 
would not stay in safety. Instead, he returned to his position to 
continue the fight. As one of his fellow marines later reported, the 
corporal was everywhere. He would run from one spot to another trying to 
get more fire on the enemy.
    When the next day broke, Corporal Day kept on fighting, alone but 
for one wounded fellow marine. Through assault after assault and into 
his second night, he fought on. Burned by white phosphorus and wounded 
by shrapnel, he continued to fire his weapon and hold his ground. He 
hauled ammunition from a disabled vehicle back to his shellhole and 
fought and fought, one assault after another, one day, then the next.
    The battle on Sugar Loaf decimated two Marine regiments. But when 
Corporal Jim Day was finally relieved after 3 days of continuous 
fighting, virtually alone, he had stood his ground. And the enemy dead 
around his foxhole numbered more than 100.
    His heroism played a crucial part in America's victory at Sugar 
Loaf. And that success opened the way to the capture of Okinawa and the 
ultimate triumph of the forces of freedom in the Pacific.
    Now, for this extraordinary valor, we recognize James L. Day as one 
of the bravest of the brave. In words that echo from the peaks of 
American military history, he has distinguished himself, at the risk of 
his life, above and beyond the call of duty. As Commander in Chief, I am 
proud to award General Day our Nation's highest military honor, the 
Medal of Honor. This medal confirms what every marine in this room 
already knows: the name Jim Day belongs in the rolls of the Corps' 
greatest heroes, alongside Dan Daly, Smedley Butler, Joe Foss, and John 
Basilone.
    General, your achievements leave us all in awe. In particular, it is 
hard to know whether we should be conferring on you a Medal of Honor for 
bravery or for modesty.
    Let me tell you the story of how we happen to be here today, over 50 
years later. Although the battle for Okinawa was still raging when his 
battlefield commanders nominated young Corporal Day* for this 
decoration, so many died in the fighting and so many reports were lost 
in the battle, the paperwork simply never went forward in 1945. General 
Day later said that awards weren't on their minds in those days. As he 
put it, ``We just had a job to do, and we wanted to get the job done.'' 
Years later, when veterans of Sugar Loaf wanted to restart the process, 
Jim Day forbade them from doing so. Then a general, he felt that seeking 
such an honor would set a bad example for those he commanded.

    General Day, everyone in our Nation, in the military and outside it, 
can learn a lot from your selfless conduct both under fire and 
throughout your life. In your modest service, as well as your heroism, 
you are a shining example to all Americans.
    Today, as we applaud one extraordinary performance on Sugar Loaf, we 
also celebrate one of the most remarkable military careers in our 
Nation's history. Just days after the action we recall now, Jim Day 
distinguished himself again on Okinawa and received the Bronze Star for

his heroism. During a career that spanned more than four decades, he 
rose from enlisted man through the ranks to major general, becoming one 
of the greatest mustangs the Marine Corps ever produced. In Korea, his 
valor in combat was recognized with two Silver Stars. In Vietnam, his 
leadership and bravery under fire earned him a third Silver Star. Just 
as astonishing, for his service in three wars, Jim Day received six 
Purple Hearts.
    General, I'm told that your ability to absorb enemy fire led to a 
lively debate among those who served with you as to whether it was safer 
to stand near you or far away. [Laughter]
    Amid all this heroism, General Day and his wife have also raised a 
fine family. He has given not only a lifetime of devotion to the Corps, 
he and Sally<Day, Sally<ls-thn-eq> have brought up two more generations 
of marines: his son, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Day,<Day, James 
A.<ls-thn-eq> and grandson, Lance Corporal Joshua Eustice,<Eustice, 
Joshua<ls-thn-eq> both of whom are here today, and we welcome you.
    General, we thank you for a lifetime lived to the highest standards 
of patriotism, dedication, and bravery. For all marines and, indeed, for 
all your fellow Americans, you are the embodiment of the motto Semper 
Fidelis. You have been unerringly faithful to those who fought alongside 
you, to the Corps, and to the United States. We are profoundly fortunate 
to count you among our heroes. On behalf of all Americans, I thank you 
for a lifetime of service without parallel and for all you have done to 
preserve the freedom that is our most sacred gift. Thank you, sir.
    Lieutenant Commander Huey,<Huey, Wesley<ls-thn-eq> read the 
citation.
