Statement on Proposed Legislation on Trade With Southeast Europe
November 12, 1999

    Today I instructed the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative to transmit to Congress the southeast Europe trade 
preference act (``SETPA''), which would authorize expansion of

duty-free treatment to a much broader range of imports from the region 
for 5 years. This legislation implements in part a trade expansion 
initiative that I launched at the Sarajevo summit in July. This 
initiative is an important part of the broader Stability Pact developed 
by the United States, our European allies and partners, and others to 
speed the economic development and democratization of southeast Europe 
and advance its integration into an undivided Europe. Along with trade 
benefits provided by European nations, these efforts can help the 
countries of the region achieve long-term economic growth. This, in 
turn, will strengthen the region's stability and reduce the risk of 
another destructive conflict.
