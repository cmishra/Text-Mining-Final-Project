Statement on the Death of Ella Fitzgerald
June 15, 1996

    I am deeply saddened by the death of Ella Fitzgerald. The jazz world 
and the Nation have suffered a tremendous loss in the passing of someone 
with so much talent, grace, and class. Ella's phenomenal voice and 
wonderful phrasing will remain close to the hearts of Americans for 
generations to come. Hillary and I extend our deepest condolences to her 
family.
