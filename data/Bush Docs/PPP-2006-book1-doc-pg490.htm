Remarks Following a Meeting With Members of Congress
March 16, 2006

    It's been my pleasure to host Republicans and Democrats from both 
the House and the Senate here to talk about budget reform. We're talking 
about the way to--for the executive branch and the legislative branch to 
work in a cooperative fashion to help make sure that the appropriations 
bills we pass are--meet priorities, that they are--that the process is 
transparent, that we're able to say to the American people, ``We care 
about how we spend your money.''
    Part of the budget reform process is a line-item veto. I want to 
thank the Members here who have come, who have offered not only 
constructive advice but practical applications of the line-item veto so 
that it becomes law. And I listened carefully to some constructive 
suggestions from both Republicans and Democrats as to how to get a piece 
of legislation passed. The American people expect all of us from both 
parties to work diligently as to how we spend their money. And one way 
that we can earn the confidence of the people is to pass a line-item 
veto.
    And again, I want to thank the Members for being here. It means a 
lot that people from both parties are here. I particularly want to thank 
my opponent in the 2004 campaign, Senator Kerry,<Kerry, John<ls-thn-eq> 
for being here. I can remember on the campaign trail, he said that he 
supported a line-item veto, and he is following through on his word by 
being here at the table. I'm proud you're here, Senator.
    Thank you all for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 10 a.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
