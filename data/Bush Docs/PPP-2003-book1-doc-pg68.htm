Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt the Middle 
East Peace Process
January 20, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to 
foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process 
is to continue in effect beyond January 23, 2003, to the Federal 
Register for publication. The most recent notice continuing this 
emergency was published in the Federal Register on January 22, 2002 (67 
FR 3033).
    The crisis with respect to the grave acts of violence committed by 
foreign terrorists that disrupt the Middle East peace process that led 
to the declaration of a national emergency on January 23, 1995, as 
expanded on August 20, 1998, has not been resolved. Terrorist groups 
continue to engage in activities that have the purpose or effect of 
threatening the Middle East peace process and that are hostile to United 
States interests in the region. Such actions constitute an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States. On August 20, 1998, the President 
identified four additional persons, including Usama bin Ladin,<bin 
Laden, Usama who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace 
process. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency declared with respect to foreign 
terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process and to 
maintain in force the economic sanctions against them to respond to this 
threat.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
January 21. The notice of January 20 is listed in Appendix D at the end 
of this volume.
