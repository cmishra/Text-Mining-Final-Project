Nomination for Ambassador to Saudi Arabia
May 11, 1994

    The President today announced his intent to nominate Raymond Edwin 
Mabus, Jr., of Mississippi, as Ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia.
    ``Ray is a good friend who I had the honor of serving with as a 
fellow Governor. As Governor of Mississippi, he represented the people 
of that State with distinction,'' the President said. ``He brings the 
leadership and vision he has demonstrated throughout his years of public 
service to this critical assignment. I am pleased to nominate him as my 
personal representative to Saudi Arabia.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
