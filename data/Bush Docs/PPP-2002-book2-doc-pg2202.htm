Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the National 
Emergency With Respect to Weapons-Usable Fissile Material in the 
Territory of the Russian Federation
December 17, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 
U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I am transmitting a 6-month 
periodic report prepared by my Administration on the national emergency 
with respect to the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the 
accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the 
Russian Federation that was declared in Executive Order 13159 of June 
21, 2000.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
