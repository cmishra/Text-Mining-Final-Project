Statement on the South African Elections
April 26, 1994

    On behalf of all Americans, I want to congratulate the people of 
South Africa on the start of the 3-day elections now taking place in 
their country. Today's images of South Africans--black and white--going 
to the polls in the face of intimidation by vicious opponents of 
democracy inspire the imagination and are a stern rebuke to the cynics 
of the world.
    South Africans are taking control of their own destinies and 
preparing to tackle the fundamental challenges of establishing a 
government of national unity, restoring stability and prosperity, and 
improving the lives of the South African people. I am proud of the role 
so many Americans have played in the struggle against apartheid. I can 
assure South Africans that we will be just as involved in helping to 
build the nonracial democracy that can come in its wake.
