Statement on House Action on the Republican Budget Proposal
April 14, 1999

    The budget passed by House Republicans falls short of what the 
American people need for meeting the challenges of the 21st century. It 
fails to lock away the surplus to strengthen Social Security and 
Medicare, and it fails to meet many of America's other critical needs 
for the future. The fiscal discipline of the past 6 years has given us a 
historic opportunity to meet our Nation's most serious long-term 
challenges. I will continue to work with the Congress to use the surplus 
to pay down our national debt, to strengthen Social Security and 
Medicare, to encourage our people to save for the future, and to meet 
our defense, education, and other long-term needs.
