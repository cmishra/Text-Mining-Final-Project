Statement on the United Nations Security Council Vote on Iraq
March 2, 1998

    Tonight's unanimous vote of the United Nations Security Council 
sends the clearest possible message: Iraq must make good on its 
commitment to give the international weapons inspectors immediate, 
unconditional, and unrestricted access to any suspect site, any place, 
any time. All of the members of the Council agree that failure to do so 
will result in the severest consequences for Iraq.
    In the days and weeks ahead, the inspectors will renew their mission 
to find and destroy Iraq's chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons 
capacity and the missiles to deliver them. Iraq now has the 
responsibility to turn the commitment it has made into full compliance.
