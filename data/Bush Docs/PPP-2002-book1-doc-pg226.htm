Statement on Senate Action on Farm Security Legislation
February 13, 2002

    I am committed to sound farm policy that supports America's farmers 
and ranchers and am disappointed that the Senate-passed bill doesn't get 
the job done. This bill front loads spending into the first 5 years, 
leaving vital programs underfunded in the years that follow. I look 
forward to working with conferees to produce a plan that will benefit 
farmers in the long term by encouraging conservation, establishing farm 
savings accounts, and promoting open markets and new opportunities for 
producers.
