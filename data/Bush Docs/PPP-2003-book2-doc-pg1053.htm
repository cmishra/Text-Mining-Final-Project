Statement on the Designation of Hamas Leadership and European Funding 
Sources Under Executive Order 13224
August 22, 2003

    At my direction, the Treasury Department has moved today to block 
and freeze the assets of six top Hamas leaders and five nongovernmental 
organizations that I am advised provide financial support to Hamas. By 
claiming responsibility for the despicable act of terror on August 19, 
Hamas has reaffirmed that it is a terrorist organization committed to 
violence against Israelis and to undermining progress toward peace 
between Israel and the Palestinian people.
    I call upon all nations supportive of peace in the Middle East to 
recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization and to take all appropriate 
actions to deny it support.
