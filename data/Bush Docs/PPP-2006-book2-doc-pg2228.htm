The President's Radio Address
December 30, 2006

    Good morning. This week, as Americans prepare to welcome a new year, 
we do so with heavy hearts and fond memories of our 38th President, 
Gerald R. Ford.<Ford, Gerald R.<ls-thn-eq> We mourn the passing of a 
courageous leader, a true gentleman, and a loving father and husband. On 
behalf of all Americans, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our 
prayers and condolences to Mrs. Ford<Ford, Elizabeth A.<ls-thn-eq> and 
the entire Ford family.
    Gerald Ford<Ford, Gerald R.<ls-thn-eq> was a great man who devoted 
the best years of his long life to public service. He fought for his 
country during World War II. After returning home, he won the first of 
13 elections to the United States Congress. The people of Michigan 
admired his dedication and decency, and so did his fellow Members of 
Congress. Gerald Ford rose to become a leader of his party, and he 
earned the respect and good will of all who had the privilege of knowing 
him.
    Gerald Ford<Ford, Gerald R.<ls-thn-eq> always believed in the 
importance of answering the call to duty, and he was there for the 
Nation when we needed him most. In December 1973, he accepted the 
responsibilities of the Vice Presidency. And the following August, he 
became President of the United States without ever seeking the office. 
Providence gave us Gerald Ford's steady hand and calm leadership during 
a time of great division and turmoil. He guided America through a crisis 
of confidence and helped our Nation mend its wounds by restoring faith 
in our system of government.
    In his 2\1/2\ years as President, Gerald Ford<Ford, Gerald 
R.<ls-thn-eq> distinguished himself as a man of integrity and selfless 
dedication. He always put the needs of his country before his own and 
did what he thought was right, even when those decisions were unpopular. 
Only years later would Americans come to fully appreciate the foresight 
and wisdom of this good man.
    In recent years, Americans have honored Gerald Ford<Ford, Gerald 
R.<ls-thn-eq> with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional 
Gold Medal, and the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award.
    Through it all, Gerald Ford<Ford, Gerald R.<ls-thn-eq> stayed true 
to the values that first led him to a life of public service, and he 
helped share that spirit with a future generation of leaders. He served 
as a mentor for Vice President Dick Cheney,<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> 
former Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld,<Rumsfeld, Donald H.<ls-thn-eq> 
former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan,<Greenspan, 
Alan<ls-thn-eq> and many others. He brought out the best in those around 
him and in our whole Nation.
    To the end, Gerald Ford<Ford, Gerald R.<ls-thn-eq> never lost the 
spirit that Americans grew to admire so much. This spring, I visited 
President and Mrs. Ford<Ford, Elizabeth A.<ls-thn-eq> at their home in 
Rancho Mirage, California. At age 92 and battling health problems, he 
was still telling jokes and displaying the optimism that helped guide 
our Nation through some of its darkest hours.
    Now America will stand with the members of the Ford family in the 
difficult hours and days ahead. Across the country, there has been an 
outpouring of grief and

affection for President Ford.<Ford, Gerald R.<ls-thn-eq> I've ordered 
flags to fly at halfstaff for 30 days in his honor. This weekend, his 
body will lie in state at the United States Capitol. And on Tuesday, 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I will join former Presidents 
Clinton,<Clinton, William J.<ls-thn-eq> Bush,<Bush, George 
H.W.<ls-thn-eq> and Carter<Carter, James E., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> at a funeral 
service at the National Cathedral as part of a National Day of Mourning.
    Gerald Ford's<Ford, Gerald R.<ls-thn-eq> life spanned nine decades 
and took him from the football fields of his boyhood in Michigan to the 
halls of power in Washington, DC. At every stage of his journey, he 
displayed a decency, patriotism, and courage that Americans will always 
admire. As we say goodbye to the year 2006, we bid farewell to one of 
the finest public servants America has ever known. We give thanks for 
the gift of his remarkable life, for the caring man who touched so many 
lives, and the wise President who helped heal our Nation.
    May God bless Gerald R. Ford.<Ford, Gerald R.<ls-thn-eq> Thank you 
for listening.
