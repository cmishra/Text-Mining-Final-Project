Statement on Representative William M. Thomas's<Thomas, William 
M.<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not To Seek Reelection
March 6, 2006

    Congressman Bill Thomas is a friend and a man of great 
accomplishment who has been a very effective leader in the House of 
Representatives. As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, he 
helped pass legislation that has brought about strong job creation and 
economic growth, improved health care for people of all ages, and 
ensured that America continues to benefit from free and fair trade. For 
the last 28 years, he has worked tirelessly for the people of the 
Bakersfield area in California and represented them with honor and 
distinction. I appreciate Bill's commitment and dedication to public 
service, and I look forward to working with him for the remainder of the 
session. I wish Sharon,<Thomas, Sharon<ls-thn-eq> Bill, and the entire 
Thomas family all the best in the future.
