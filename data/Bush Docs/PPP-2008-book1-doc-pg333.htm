Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Jerusalem
March 6, 2008

    I condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack in 
Jerusalem that targeted innocent students at the Mercaz Harav Yeshiva. 
This barbaric and vicious attack on innocent civilians deserves the 
condemnation of every nation.
    I have just spoken with Prime Minister Olmert<Olmert, 
Ehud<ls-thn-eq> to extend my deepest condolences to the victims, their 
families, and to the people of Israel. I told him the United States 
stands firmly with Israel in the face of this terrible attack.
