Exchange With Reporters on Cuba
August 30, 1993

    Q. Mr. President, are there any conditions that would be met that 
you would be able to end the U.S. embargo on Cuba?
    The President. We've had the press conference. [Laughter]
    I support the Torricelli bill, as you know. I did when it was 
passed, and I still do. But I said before, I could just reiterate what I 
said again: We all hope that there will come a time when democracy and 
an open economy will come to Cuba. And it will be a cause of enormous 
celebration in this country when it happens.

Note: The exchange began at 2:36 p.m. in the Blue Room at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this 
exchange.
