your home. Through the last century and into our own, Americans have 
appreciated the friendship of your people. And we are grateful for your 
personal commitment across five decades to the health and vitality of 
the alliance between our nations.
    Of course, things didn't start out too well. [Laughter] Yet, even at 
America's founding, our nations shared a basic belief in human liberty. 
That conviction more than anything else led to our reconciliation. And 
in time, our shared commitment to freedom became the basis of a great 
Atlantic alliance that defeated tyranny in Europe and saved the liberty 
of the world.
    The story of liberty, the story of the Magna Carta and the 
Declaration of Independence, continues in our time. The power of freedom 
has touched Asia and Latin America and Africa and beyond. And now our 
two countries are carrying out a mission of freedom and democracy in 
Afghanistan and Iraq. Once again, America and Britain are joined in the 
defense of our common values. Once again, American and British 
servicemembers are sacrificing in a necessary and noble cause. Once 
again, we are acting to secure the peace of the world.
    The bonds between our countries were formed in hard experience. We 
passed through great adversity together. We have risen through great 
challenges together. The mutual respect and fellowship between our 
countries is deep and strong and permanent.
    Let us raise our glasses to our common ideals, to our enduring 
friendships, to the preservation of our liberties, and to Her Majesty, 
the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Note: The President spoke at 8:49 p.m. in the Ballroom at Buckingham 
Palace. In his remarks, he referred to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. 
The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also 
included the remarks of Queen Elizabeth II. A tape was not available for 
verification of the content of these remarks.
