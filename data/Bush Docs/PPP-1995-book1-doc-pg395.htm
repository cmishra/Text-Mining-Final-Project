Statement on Senate Action on the Line-Item Veto
March 23, 1995

    The Senate tonight has taken another step toward passing strong 
line-item veto legislation. I hope the House and Senate will now get 
together quickly to resolve their differences and pass the strongest 
possible bill.
    The sooner such a bill reaches my desk, the sooner I can take 
further steps to cut the deficit.
