Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Islamabad, Pakistan
March 17, 2002

    I am outraged by the terrorist attack that took place today in 
Islamabad, Pakistan, against innocent civilians. I strongly condemn them 
as acts of murder that cannot be tolerated by any person of conscience 
nor justified by any cause. On behalf of the American people, I extend 
my deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims of 
this terrible tragedy, and I wish a full and fast recovery to those 
injured. We will work closely with the Government of Pakistan to ensure 
those responsible for this terrorist attack face justice.
