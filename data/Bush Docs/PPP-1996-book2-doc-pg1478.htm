To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification a 
Protocol, signed at Jakarta July 24, 1996, Amending the Convention 
Between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Avoidance of Double 
Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on 
Income, with a Related Protocol and Exchange of Notes Signed at Jakarta
