Letter to Congressional Leaders on Modifying Duty-Free Treatment Under 
the Generalized System of Preferences To Include Afghanistan
January 10, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Afghanistan to the 
list of beneficiary developing countries and to the list of least-
developed beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP). I have carefully considered the criteria 
identified in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. 
In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to 
extend GSP beneficiary developing country and least-developed 
beneficiary developing country benefits to Afghanistan.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on January 13. 
An original was not available for verification of the content of this 
letter. The related proclamation of January 10 is listed in Appendix D 
at the end of this volume.
