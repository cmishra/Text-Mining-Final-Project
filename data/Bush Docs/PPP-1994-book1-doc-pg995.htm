Statement on the Death of Timothy West
May 26, 1994

    Hillary and I were heartbroken when we learned that Timothy West, 
the 4-year-old boy with leukemia who hugged me so close when I visited 
him, died this morning in Houston. This precious boy carried the burdens 
of his illness with courage and a sense of warmth that touched me 
deeply. Our prayers are with Timothy's parents, Chris and Lisa West, and 
we especially want to thank the doctors, nurses, and staff of the M.D. 
Anderson Cancer Center for pouring so much of themselves into Timothy's 
treatment and care. On such a sorrowful day, I hope they will feel 
healed by Timothy's strength and the knowledge that he is now with God.
