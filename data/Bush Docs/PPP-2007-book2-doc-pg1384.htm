Statement on Senate Confirmation of Leslie H. Southwick<Southwick, 
Leslie H.<ls-thn-eq> as United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth 
Circuit
October 24, 2007

    The confirmation of Judge Leslie Southwick to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is a victory for America's judicial system 
and for the citizens of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Today's 
bipartisan vote resolves a longstanding judicial emergency and will help 
ensure that the Fifth Circuit can operate more effectively. Judge 
Southwick is a man of character and intelligence who will apply the law 
fairly. I appreciate the Senate's approval of his nomination.
    While today's vote resolves one judicial emergency, many of 
America's Federal courts continue to have unnecessary vacancies. I have 
nominated highly qualified men and women to serve on these courts. Now 
the Senate must act. In the final 2 years of the past 3 administrations, 
the Senate has confirmed an average of 17 circuit court judges. But 
since January of this year, the Senate has confirmed only five circuit 
court nominees. The Senate has more work to do. I once again call upon 
the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities and promptly 
provide these nominees fair up-or-down votes.
