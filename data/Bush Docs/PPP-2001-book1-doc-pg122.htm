Statement on the Death of Dale Earnhardt<Earnhardt, Dale<ls-thn-eq>
February 22, 2001

    I have asked my close friend Joe Allbaugh<Allbaugh, Joe 
M.<ls-thn-eq> to attend today's memorial service for Dale Earnhardt. I 
am saddened by the untimely loss of this American legend and want to 
express my deepest sympathy to his family, friends, and fans. Dale was 
an American icon who made great contributions to his sport. Dale's 
legacy will live on for millions of Americans. He was an inspiration to 
many.
