Remarks Following a Meeting With the 2008 Bassmaster Classic 
Champion<Jones, Alton<ls-thn-eq> and 2007 Women's Bassmaster Tour 
Champion<Wong, Judy<ls-thn-eq>
March 25, 2008

    The President. I've got the fishing champs from this year. And, 
Judy, thanks for coming.
    Judy Wong. Oh, thank you.
    The President. She is from Many, Louisiana. She won the Women's 
Bassmaster. And Alton Jones from Waco, Texas, won the Bassmaster 
Classic.
    And I thought it was important to welcome these champs here to the 
White House so that--you know, to encourage people to fish. There's 
nothing better than fishing. I had a fantastic experience with Alton and 
our friend Charlie Pack.<Pack, Charlie<ls-thn-eq> He was a famous local 
fisherman, and he said, ``Do you want to go fishing with a fellow named 
Jones?'' I said: ``I've never heard of him. There's a lot people named 
Jones.'' [Laughter] It turns out, the man I was fishing with is the--
wins the Bassmaster Classic.
    This is a good, clean sport. It's a sport that requires good 
conservation in order to make sure our fisheries are good. And I love 
welcoming the champs here. And so we're glad you're here.
    Ms. Wong.  Thank you.
    The President. The people in Louisiana and Texas are proud of you.
    Alton Jones. Well, it's an honor to be here. You know, fishing with 
you, I've got to say that President Bush is actually a very good 
fisherman and a great conservationist. And I'm really not sure who's 
working who here. I'm hoping to get an invite to fish on his lake in 
Crawford.
    The President. That's right.
    Mr. Jones. And he's looking for a free fishing guide. [Laughter]
    Ms. Wong. I would be glad to take you any day on Toledo Bend.
    The President. That's good.
    Ms. Wong. Okay.
    The President.Well, thank you, Judy.
    Ms. Wong. And bring Laura as well.
    The President. Well, yes,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> she's--I'm a good 
fisherman; sometimes I'm a good catcher-man. [Laughter]
    Mr. Jones. There's a big difference.
    The President. Yes, there is. Anyway, thank you all for coming.
