Statement on the Murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian
October 24, 1998

    I am outraged by the murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last 
night in Amherst, NY. The Department of Justice is working with State 
and local authorities to find the person or persons responsible and 
bring them to justice. While we do not have all the facts of this case, 
one thing is clear: this Nation cannot tolerate violence directed at 
those providing a constitutionally protected medical service.
    No matter where we stand on the issue of abortion, all Americans 
must stand together in condemning this tragic and brutal act. We must 
protect the safety and freedom of all our citizens.
    Hillary and I extend our thoughts and prayers to the family of Dr. 
Slepian.
