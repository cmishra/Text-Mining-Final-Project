Statement on Implementation of the National Voter Registration Act of 
1993
September 12, 1994

    This law creates the opportunity to include millions of Americans in 
the political process who have previously been excluded because of 
difficult and confusing voting rules. I urge all Americans of all 
political parties to register to vote, and I urge the voter registration 
groups to continue and expand their efforts to ensure as many of our 
citizens as possible are registered.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the Executive order

of September 12 on implementation of the National Voter Registration Act 
of 1993. The Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
