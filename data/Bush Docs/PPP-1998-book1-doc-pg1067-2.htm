Message to the Senate Transmitting the Latvia-United States
Tax Convention With Documentation
June 26, 1998

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of 
Latvia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal 
Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at Washington on January 
15, 1998. Also transmitted is the report of the Department of State 
concerning the Convention.
    This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United 
States and OECD nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to 
various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. 
The Convention also provides for resolution of disputes and sets forth 
rules making its benefits unavailable to residents that are engaged in 
treaty shopping.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to 
ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

June 26, 1998.
