Statement on the Resignation of Jack D. Crouch II<Crouch, Jack D., 
III<ls-thn-eq> as Deputy National Security Adviser
May 4, 2007

    Dr. J.D. Crouch II came to the White House in January 2005 to serve 
as my Deputy National Security Adviser. J.D. has served our country with 
great distinction during a critical period in our history, as we 
confront new challenges and pursue a global war on terror. In the past 
2\1/2\ years, his accomplishments have been many. He was at the 
forefront in devising and implementing the new strategy to help build a 
peaceful, stable, and secure Iraq. He wasinstrumental in developing the 
new national security strategy that charts a course for advancing our 
interests abroad, enhancing global security and liberty, and protecting 
the American people. J.D. is leaving the White House, but Steve 
Hadley,<Hadley, Stephen J.<ls-thn-eq> all his colleagues, and I have 
benefited greatly from his wise counsel and tireless commitment to 
public service.
