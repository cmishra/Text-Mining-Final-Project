Remarks to the Community in Poplarville, Mississippi
September 5, 2005

[The President's remarks are joined in progress.]

    ----out of this despair is going to come a vibrant coast. It's--
again, I understand if you're saying to yourself, ``Well, it's hard for 
me to realize what George W. is saying, because I've seen the rubble and 
I know what has happened to my neighbors.'' But I'd like to come back 
down here in about 2 years and walk your streets and see how vital this 
part of the world is going to be.

    I can't wait to join you in the joy of welcoming neighbors back into 
neighborhoods, and small businesses up and running, and cutting those 
ribbons that somebody is creating new jobs. That's what I think is going 
to happen.
    I just want you to know that when I'm thinking about how we can help 
this part of the world, Mississippi is on my mind. Mississippi is a part 
of the future of this country, and part of that future is to help you 
get back up on your feet. And I'm confident that your United States 
Senator Trent Lott,<Lott, C. Trent<ls-thn-eq> if I don't say it loud 
enough, he will. [Laughter] He'll remind us. But I appreciate you taking 
time out of your day.
    And by the way, I'm traveling with good company. My wife, 
Laura,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> is with me too.
    Let me conclude by asking for God's blessings on you all and your 
families and friends, and let you know we're here for the long term. I 
understand. I understand the damage. I understand the devastation.

I understand the destruction. I understand how long it's going to take. 
And we're with you. That's what I want you to know. God bless.

Note: The President spoke at 2:12 p.m. at Pearl River Community College. 
The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
transcript of these remarks.
