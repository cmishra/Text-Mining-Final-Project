Statement on a Supplemental Appropriations Request To Support the Areas 
Recovering From the Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunamis
February 9, 2005

    More than 6 weeks have passed since the tsunami took over 150,000 
lives in one of the world's worst natural disasters. Thanks to the 
immediate and effective response of the U.S. military and the U.S. 
Agency for International Development, the United States, working with 
other members of the international community, was able to prevent 
additional loss of life and to deliver relief to those in need.
    I will seek $950 million as part of the supplemental appropriations 
request to support the areas recovering from the tsunami and to cover 
the costs of relief efforts to date. This amount includes an additional 
$600 million above my initial commitment of $350 million. We will use 
these resources to provide assistance and to work with the affected 
nations on rebuilding vital infrastructure that reenergizes economies 
and strengthens societies.
    I appreciate the efforts of former Presidents Bush<Bush, George 
H.W.<ls-thn-eq> and Clinton<Clinton, William J.<ls-thn-eq> to raise 
private donations in the United States, and we are grateful to all of 
those who have donated money to help those in need.
