Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Immigration Reform 
Legislation
December 16, 2005

    I applaud the House for passing a strong immigration reform bill. 
America is a nation built on the rule of law, and this bill will help us 
protect our borders and crack down on illegal entry into the United 
States. Securing our borders is essential to securing the homeland. I 
urge the Senate to take action on immigration reform so that I can sign 
a good bill into law.
