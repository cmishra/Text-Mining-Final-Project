Statement on Action Concerning Japanese Whaling Practices
September 13, 2000

    Following Secretary Mineta's<Mineta, Norman Y.> 
certification that Japan is undermining international whaling 
protections with its expanded whaling program, I am today directing that 
Japan be denied future access to fishing rights in U.S. waters and 
directing members of my Cabinet to consider additional steps we might 
take, including possible trade sanctions.
    Strong international cooperation has allowed the recovery of many 
whale species once pushed to the brink of extinction. We must work to 
ensure that these protections are upheld. I hope that the steps we take 
today will encourage Japan to reverse its actions and respect the strong 
international consensus that has helped bring back some of Earth's most 
majestic creatures.
