Statement on the Death of J. Carter Brown<Brown, J. Carter>
June 18, 2002

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of J. Carter Brown. Carter had 
a profound influence on the arts and architecture of Washington, 
increasing the prominence of the National Gallery of Art and presiding 
over some of the most significant developments to our Nation's Capital 
in the 20th century. He committed his life to service and will be sorely 
missed. We express our deepest sympathies to Carter's family.
