January 10, 2003

    Laura<Bush, Laura> and I are saddened by the news of the 
passing of Steve Young, national president of the Fraternal Order of 
Police. Steve made important contributions to our country as a police 
officer, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, and as a member of 
the Homeland Security Advisory Council. Steve was a true hero for his 
dedication

to ensuring the safety of our communities. He was a great friend and an 
honorable and loyal man.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult 
time.
