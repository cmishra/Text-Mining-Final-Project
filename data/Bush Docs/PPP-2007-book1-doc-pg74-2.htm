Remarks Following Breakfast With Small-Business Leaders in Peoria, 
Illinois
January 30, 2007

    I'm here in Peoria for a couple of reasons. One, I'm looking forward 
to going to a great American company, Caterpillar, and talking about the 
importance of opening up markets for U.S. products, because when 
Caterpillar sells its products overseas, it helps people find work here 
in Peoria. But equally importantly, I'm here with some business 
entrepreneurs and social entrepreneurs.
    Here are my impressions: One, the business sector--small-business 
sector--of the heartland is strong. And it's really strong because of 
low taxes. But it's also strong because of--the entrepreneurial spirit 
is

strong. You can't have a good business unless you have somebody willing 
to lead that business.
    Secondly, I am very impressed by the civic spirit of the people 
here. People understand that when you live in a community, you have an 
obligation to help that community realize its full potential. I'm real 
proud of the reverend,<Criss, Timothy E.<ls-thn-eq> who has taken a 
tough neighborhood here in Peoria and helped revitalize that 
neighborhood by utilizing his skills, his talent, and a power higher 
than himself.
    The Congressman<LaHood, Ray H.<ls-thn-eq> told me that when I came 
back to Peoria, I'd find a community that's vibrant and strong and 
optimistic, and people around this table are vibrant and strong and 
optimistic. And I can't thank you enough for sharing your concerns, 
talking about your hopes. And I can't thank you enough for working hard 
to really make America the great country that it is.
    So God bless, and thanks for your time.

Note: The President spoke at 9:12 a.m. at the Sterling Family 
Restaurant. In his remarks, he referred to Rev. Timothy E. Criss, 
pastor, City of Refuge Worship Center, Peoria, IL. The Office of the 
Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of these 
remarks.
