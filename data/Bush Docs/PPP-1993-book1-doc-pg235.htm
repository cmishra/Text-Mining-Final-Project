Statement on the Death of Albert Sabin
March 3, 1993

    I was saddened to learn of the passing this morning of Dr. Albert 
Sabin, one of the great heroes of American medicine. The oral polio 
vaccine that he developed has saved countless lives and provided 
millions more with the comfort of security.
    I have made a commitment to work towards the goal of ensuring that 
all of our Nation's children receive proper immunizations. This loss 
today reminds us all of the seriousness with which that task must be 
taken. We must continue the battle which Albert Sabin so nobly waged.
