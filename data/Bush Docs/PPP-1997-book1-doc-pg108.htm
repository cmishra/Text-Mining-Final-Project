Message to the Congress Transmitting the Estonia-United States Fisheries 
Agreement
February 4, 1997

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement 
between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Republic of Estonia Extending the Agreement of June 1, 
1992, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States, with 
annex, as extended (``the 1992 Agreement''). The Agreement, which was 
effected by an exchange of notes at Tallinn on June 3 and 28, 1996, 
extends the 1992 Agreement to June 30, 1998.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Estonia, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 4, 1997.
