Memorandum on the Proposed Amendment to the United States/United Kingdom 
Agreement for Cooperation on the Use of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense 
Purposes
June 14, 2004

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy

Subject: Proposed Amendment to the United States/United Kingdom 
Agreement for Cooperation on the Use of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense 
Purposes

    I have reviewed and concur in the recommendations in your letter of 
June 7, 2004, recommending approval of a proposed amendment to the 
Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense 
Purposes. I note from your joint recommendation and concur with your 
assessment that the United Kingdom, by participating with the United 
States pursuant to an international agreement, is making substantial and 
material contributions to the mutual defense and security. The proposed 
Amendment will permit cooperation that will further improve our mutual 
defense posture and support our interests under the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. I hereby:

  <bullet>   approve the proposed Amendment to the 1958 Agreement;
  <bullet>   determine that performance under the proposed Amendment 
            will promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to 
            the common defense and security;
  <bullet>   approve the program outlined in this Amendment and 
            determine that such program will promote and will not 
            constitute an unreasonable risk to the mutual defense and 
            security; and
  <bullet>   authorize the execution of the proposed Amendment for the 
            Government of the United States in a manner specified by the 
            Secretary of State.

                                                          George W. Bush
