Remarks During a Visit to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem
January 11, 2008

    Mr. President<Peres, Shimon<ls-thn-eq> and Mr. Prime 
Minister,<Olmert, Ehud<ls-thn-eq> thank you for your wonderful 
hospitality. I would hope as many people in the world would come to this 
place, it would be a sobering reminder that evil exists and a call that 
when we find evil, we must resist it. It also is a--I guess I came away 
with this impression, that I was most impressed that people, in the face 
of horror and evil, would not forsake their God, that in the face of 
unspeakable crimes against humanity, brave souls, young and old, stood 
strong for what they believe.
    It's an honor to be here. It is a moving experience, and it is a 
living memory that is important. Thank you, sir.<Shalev, 
Avner<ls-thn-eq>

Note: The President spoke at 9:43 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel; and 
Avner Shalev, chairman, Yad Vashem Directorate.
