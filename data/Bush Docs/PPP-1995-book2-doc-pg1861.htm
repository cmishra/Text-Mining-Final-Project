Message to the Congress on Ordering the Selected Reserve of the Armed 
Forces to Active Duty
December 8, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    I have today, pursuant to section 12304 of title 10, United States 
Code, authorized the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of 
Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating 
as a service in the Department of the Navy, to order to active duty any 
units, and any individual members not assigned to a unit organized to 
serve as a unit, of the Selected Reserve to perform such missions the 
Secretary of Defense may determine necessary. The deployment of United 
States forces to conduct operational missions in and around former 
Yugoslavia necessitates this action.
    A copy of the Executive order implementing this action is attached.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

December 8, 1995.

Note: The Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
