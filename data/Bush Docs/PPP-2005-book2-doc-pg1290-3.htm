you hear me?
    Commander Eileen M. Collins.<Collins, Eileen M.<ls-thn-eq> Yes, sir, 
we hear you loud and clear. Good morning.
    The President. Good morning. Thank you for taking my phone call. I 
just wanted to tell you all how proud the American people are of our 
astronauts. I want to thank you for being risktakers for the sake of 
exploration. I want to welcome our Japanese and Australian and Russian 
friends. And I wish you Godspeed in your mission. I know you've got very 
important work to do ahead of you. We look forward to seeing the 
successful completion of this mission. And obviously, as you prepare to 
come back, a lot of Americans will be praying for a safe return.
    So it's great talking to you. Thanks for being such great examples 
of courage for a lot of our fellow citizens.
    Commander Collins.<Collins, Eileen M.<ls-thn-eq> Thank you very 
much, Mr. President. We want to tell you that we really enjoy what we're 
doing. We really believe in our mission, and we believe in space 
exploration and getting people off the planet and seeing what's out 
there. So the steps that we're taking right

you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedule to talk to 
us.

Commander,<Collins, Eileen M.<ls-thn-eq> and thank your fellow 
astronauts there. I agree with you. I think what you're doing is really 
important. And you've got a strong supporter for your mission, here in 
the White House. I will tell you Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> went down 
and watched the launch in Florida with my little brother Jeb<Bush, 
Jeb<ls-thn-eq> and came back all excited about the energy that--there on 
the east coast of Florida. But we're with you and wish you all the very 
best. Thanks for taking my phone call. Now get back to work.

much, sir. We did fly over Texas today and had a good look at it. It was 
beautiful. Have a good day.
