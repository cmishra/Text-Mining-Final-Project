Message to the Senate Transmitting the Convention on Pollock Resources 
in the Central Bering Sea
August 9, 1994

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Convention on the Conservation and 
Management of Pollock Resources in the Central Bering Sea, with Annex, 
done at Washington on June 16, 1994. The Convention was signed on that 
date by the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, the 
Russian Federation, and the United States. Japan and the Republic of 
Poland, the other participating countries in the negotiation of the 
Convention, are expected to sign the Convention in the near future. I 
transmit also, for the information of the Senate, a report of the 
Secretary of State concerning the Convention.
    This Convention is a state-of-the-art fishing agreement that will 
aid in ensuring the long-term health of pollock stocks in the central 
Bering Sea on which the U.S. pollock industry in the Pacific Northwest 
in part depends. Its strong conservation and management measures will be 
backed up with effective enforcement provisions. The agreement will 
require that each vessel fishing for pollock in the central Bering Sea 
carry scientific observers and use real-time satellite position-fixing 
transmitters. All vessels of the Parties fishing in the central Bering 
Sea must consent to boarding and inspection by authorized officials of 
other States Parties for compliance with the provisions of the 
Convention.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Convention and provide its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
August 9, 1994.
