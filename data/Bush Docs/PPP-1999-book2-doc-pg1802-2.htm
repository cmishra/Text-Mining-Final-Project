Statement on United Nations Security Council Action Against 
International Terrorism and the Taliban
October 15, 1999

    I applaud the U.N. Security Council for taking a strong stand 
against international terrorism today and demanding that the Taliban 
stop harboring Usama bin <bin Ladin, Usama>Ladin. The Security 
Council's resolution, which passed by a unanimous vote, will result in 
economic sanctions being placed on the Taliban if they do not deliver 
bin Ladin within 30 days to a country where he can be brought to 
justice.
    The Security Council's action demonstrates the international 
community's understanding of the threat posed by bin Ladin<bin Ladin, 
Usama> and his network of terrorists. Despite the condemnation 
of scores of countries after the 1998 bombing of our Embassies in Kenya 
and Tanzania, the Taliban has continued to allow bin Ladin and his 
network to operate training camps, make threats against the United 
States and others, and plan terrorist operations from their bases in 
Afghanistan. Now the international community has spoken with one voice. 
The sanctions the U.N. has chosen parallel the unilateral ones that the 
United States placed on the Taliban in July and will result in the 
restriction of landing rights of airlines owned, leased, or operated by 
or on behalf of the Taliban, the freezing of Taliban accounts around the 
world, and the prohibition of investment in any undertaking owned or 
controlled by the Taliban.
    The international community has sent a clear message. The choice 
between cooperation and isolation lies with the Taliban.
