Letter on Withdrawal of the Nomination of Admiral Bobby R. Inman 
To Be Secretary of Defense 
January 18, 1994

Dear Admiral Inman:
    It is with regret that I accept your request that I not submit your 
nomination as Secretary of Defense. While I understand the personal 
considerations that have led you to this decision, I am nevertheless 
saddened that our Nation will be denied your service.
    I wish you the very best as you continue to work on your many 
important endeavors as a private citizen.
    Very truly yours,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: The White House also made available Admiral Inman's letter 
requesting that his nomination be withdrawn.
