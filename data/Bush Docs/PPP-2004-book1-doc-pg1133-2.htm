Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Amendments
June 25, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget 
amendments for the Departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, 
Justice, State, and Transportation; as well as the General Services 
Administration, the Election Assistance Commission, and the Federal 
Communications Commission. In total, these amendments would not increase 
the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2005 Budget.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
