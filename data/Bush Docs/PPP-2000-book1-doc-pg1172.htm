Statement on the Ethiopia-Eritrea Cease-Fire Agreement
June 18, 2000

    Today in Algiers, Ethiopia and Eritrea signed an agreement to cease 
hostilities. This is a breakthrough which can and should end the tragic 
conflict in the Horn of Africa. It can and should permit these two 
countries to realize their potential in peace, instead of squandering it 
in war.
    I commend the Organization of African Unity, and especially its 
chair, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,<Bouteflika, 
Abdelaziz<ls-thn-eq> for leading the negotiation of this agreement. I am 
grateful to my envoy, former National Security Adviser Anthony 
Lake,<Lake, Anthony<ls-thn-eq> to Assistant Secretary of State Susan 
Rice,<Rice, Susan E.<ls-thn-eq> and to my senior adviser on African 
affairs, Gayle Smith,<Smith, Gayle<ls-thn-eq> for their tireless pursuit 
of a peaceful resolution to this conflict. The United States has 
supported the OAU in this effort, and we will continue to do so. I have 
asked Tony Lake to return to Algiers to work with the OAU as we enter 
the next round of negotiations.
    I hope this commitment by Ethiopia and Eritrea to stop the fighting 
also signals their commitment to build the peace. I urge them to use the 
next round of talks to produce a final, comprehensive, lasting 
agreement, so they can get on with the work of pursuing democracy and 
development for their people. Ethiopia and Eritrea are America's 
friends. If they are ready to take the next step, we and our partners in 
the international community will walk with them.
