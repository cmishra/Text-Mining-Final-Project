Statement on the Death of Byron Nelson<Nelson, J. Byron, Jr.<ls-thn-eq>
September 26, 2006

    I was saddened to learn today of the passing of Byron Nelson. Byron 
Nelson was a legend in the game of golf, setting extraordinary standards 
for excellence on the course. More importantly, he was a true gentleman 
and role model for generations of golfers. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
and I join fellow Texans and the sports world in extending our 
sympathies to his wife, Peggy,<Nelson, Peggy<ls-thn-eq> and his family 
and friends.
