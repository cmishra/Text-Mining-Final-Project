Remarks on the 2008 Presidential Election
November 5, 2008

    Good morning. Last night I had a warm conversation with President-
elect Barack Obama.<Obama, Barack<ls-thn-eq> I congratulated him and 
Senator Biden<Biden, Joseph R., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> on their impressive 
victory. I told the President-elect he can count on complete cooperation 
from my administration as he makes the transition to the White House.
    I also spoke to Senator John McCain.<McCain, John<ls-thn-eq> I 
congratulated him on a determined campaign that he and Governor 
Palin<Palin, Sarah<ls-thn-eq> ran. The American people will always be 
grateful for the lifetime of service John McCain has devoted to this 
Nation, and I know he'll continue to make tremendous contributions to 
our country.
    No matter how they cast their ballots, all Americans can be proud of 
the history that was made yesterday. Across the country, citizens voted 
in large numbers. They showed a watching world the vitality of America's 
democracy and the strides we have made toward a more perfect union. They 
chose a President<Obama, Barack<ls-thn-eq> whose journey represents a 
triumph of the American story, a testament to hard work, optimism, and 
faith in the enduring promise of our Nation.
    Many of our citizens thought they would never live to see that day. 
This moment is especially uplifting for a generation of Americans who 
witnessed the struggle for civil rights with their own eyes and, four 
decades later, see a dream fulfilled.
    A long campaign has now ended, and we move forward as one nation. 
We're embarking on a period of change in Washington, yet there are some 
things that will not change. The United States Government will stay 
vigilant in meeting its most important responsibility: protecting the 
American people. And the world can be certain this commitment will 
remain steadfast under our next Commander in Chief.<Obama, 
Barack<ls-thn-eq>
    There's important work to do in the months ahead, and I will 
continue to conduct the people's business as long as this office remains 
in my trust. During this time of transition, I will keep the President-
elect<Obama, Barack<ls-thn-eq> fully informed on important decisions. 
And when the time comes on January the 20th, Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I will return home to Texas with treasured memories 
of our time here and with profound gratitude for the honor of serving 
this amazing country.
    It will be a stirring sight to watch President Obama,<Obama, 
Barack<ls-thn-eq> his wife Michelle,<Obama, Michelle<ls-thn-eq> and 
their beautiful<Obama, Malia<ls-thn-eq> girls<Obama, Natasha 
``Sasha''<ls-thn-eq> step through the doors of the White House. I know 
millions of Americans will be overcome with pride at this inspiring 
moment that so many have waited so long. I know Senator Obama's beloved

mother and grandparents would have been thrilled to watch the child they 
raised ascend the steps of the Capitol and take his oath to uphold the 
Constitution of the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.
    Last night I extended an invitation to the President-elect<Obama, 
Barack<ls-thn-eq> and Mrs. Obama<Obama, Michelle<ls-thn-eq> to come to 
the White House, and Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are looking 
forward to welcoming them as soon as possible.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 10:20 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska; and 
Natasha ``Sasha'' and Malia Obama, daughters of President-elect Barack 
Obama. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish 
language transcript of these remarks.
