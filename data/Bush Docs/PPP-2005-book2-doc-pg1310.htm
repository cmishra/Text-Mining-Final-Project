Remarks in Waco, Texas, on the Death of Peter Jennings<Jennings, 
Peter<ls-thn-eq>
August 8, 2005

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I were saddened to learn about the 
death of Peter Jennings. Peter Jennings had a long and distinguished 
career as a news journalist. He covered many important events, events 
that helped define the world as we know it today. A lot of Americans 
relied upon Peter Jennings for their news. He became a part of the lives 
of a lot of our fellow citizens, and he will be missed. May God bless 
his soul.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 9:52 a.m. at Texas State Technical College. 
A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
