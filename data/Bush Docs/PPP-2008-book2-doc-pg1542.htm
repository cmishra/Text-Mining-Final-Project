Statement on the Death of Cardinal Pio Laghi<Laghi, Pio 
Cardinal<ls-thn-eq>
January 11, 2009

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our deepest condolences to 
Pope Benedict XVI<Pope Benedict XVI<ls-thn-eq> and all Catholics on the 
passing of Cardinal Pio Laghi. Cardinal Laghi was a friend who, in his 
more than 60 years of service to the Catholic Church, worked tirelessly 
for peace and justice in our world. As the Papal Nuncio to the United 
States during the final years of the cold war, and in his many other 
assignments, Cardinal Laghi always strove to unite people of all 
religions and promote reconciliation, religious freedom, and tolerance. 
Cardinal Laghi holds an especially

important place in the hearts of the American people, having served as 
the first Papal Nuncio to the United States following the formal 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the 
Holy See in 1984.
    On behalf of all Americans, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I join 
Catholics around the world to offer our gratitude for the courageous 
service and life of Cardinal Laghi and commit ourselves to carrying his 
peaceful message forward.
