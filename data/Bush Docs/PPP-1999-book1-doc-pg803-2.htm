Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Burma
May 18, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the emergency declared with respect to Burma is to continue in effect 
beyond May 20, 1999.
    As long as the Government of Burma continues its policies of 
committing large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma, 
this situation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this 
reason, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force 
these emergency authorities beyond May 20, 1999.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

May 18, 1999.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
