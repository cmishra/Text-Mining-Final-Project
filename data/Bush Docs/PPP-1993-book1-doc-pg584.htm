Nomination for Posts at the Department of State
May 6, 1993

    The President named two experienced environmental leaders to Senior 
Executive Service positions at the State Department today. Rafe 
Pomerance will serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Environment, 
Health, and Natural Resources, and Jessica Tuchman Mathews will serve as 
Deputy Under Secretary for Global Affairs.
    ``The global environment is one of the most serious issues facing 
our Nation,'' said the President. ``These two nominees have a lifetime 
of experience and knowledge in working on this critical issue. I look 
forward to working with them to attack the pressing problems of global 
pollution.''
