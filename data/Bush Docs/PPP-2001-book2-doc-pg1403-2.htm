Joint Statement by President George W. Bush and<Putin, 
Vladimir> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Cooperation 
in Combating Illegal Narcotics Trafficking
November 13, 2001

    We note that illegal narcotics trafficking constitutes a serious 
threat to the health and well-being of individuals and to international 
security as a whole. The drug trade is one of the principle sources of 
financial support for international terrorism.
    The United States and Russia are committed to intensifying 
cooperation on both a bilateral level and within the framework of 
international organizations and institutions, in order to combat this 
common threat.
    We reaffirm the important role of the UN in strengthening anti-drug 
cooperation at the global level and reaffirm the two countries' 
intention to continue the efforts to implement the decisions of the 20th 
Special Session of the UN General Assembly on the problem of narcotics. 
At the same time, we wish to continue and expand our regional 
counternarcotics cooperation with the countries of Central Asia.
    We wish to underscore the importance of putting into effect, as soon 
as possible, the mechanism of the UN Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime.
    We intend to intensify the efforts of the Russian-U.S. Working Group 
on law enforcement, including the issues of combating illegal drug 
trafficking and the laundering of proceeds derived from criminal 
activities. We believe that early entry into the force of the Treaty 
Between the Russian Federation and the United States on Mutual Legal 
Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Moscow on June 17, 1999, will 
promote the expansion of bilateral cooperation and the coordination of 
efforts against transnational organized crime and narcotics trafficking.

    We agree to seek areas of expanded cooperation between the United 
States and Russia with the goal of more effectively stopping illegal 
trafficking in narcotics and preventing and treating drug addiction.
