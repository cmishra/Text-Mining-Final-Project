Remarks Honoring the 2003 Women's National Basketball Association 
Champion Detroit Shock
May 24, 2004

    The President. Thank you all for coming. Welcome to the Rose Garden, 
and congratulations to the 2003 WNBA championship team from Detroit. 
That's who we're here to honor. It's good to welcome the 
coach.<Laimbeer, William, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> [Laughter] I don't know if 20 
years ago they would have thought of you as a coach.

    William Laimbeer, Jr.<Laimbeer, William, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> I know. I 
know. [Laughter]

    The President. But he made a pretty darn good one, didn't 
he?<Laimbeer, William, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> I'm real proud of your leadership.

    I want to thank Tom Wilson<Wilson, Tom<ls-thn-eq> for being here; 
Val Ackerman,<Ackerman, Val<ls-thn-eq> here as well. I want to thank the 
players and the coaches for coming.
    This is an historic season for the Shock. After all, you went from 
worst to first. Isn't that right?
    Team member. Yes, that's right. [Laughter]
    The President. And interestingly enough, in winning the 
championship, you drew the largest crowd in league history, which says 
something about the talent and the flair and the charisma of the 
players. I think one of the things that good teams do is, they decide to 
be a team. They come together and say, ``We're going to win as a team.'' 
And that's what this team did. There was tremendous discipline, hard 
work, and good leadership. And I'm proud of the fact, and I know the 
women on this team are, that you were Coach of the Year<Laimbeer, 
William, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> in the WNBA.

    I said they came together as a team, but they had great talent. Ruth 
Riley<Riley, Ruth<ls-thn-eq> was the WNBA Finals MVP. The Rookie of the 
Year was Cheryl Ford,<Ford, Cheryl<ls-thn-eq> and a member of the 2004 
Olympic team was Swin Cash.<Cash, Swin<ls-thn-eq> This is a team with 
talent but learned to blend the talent for a greater whole.
    They tell me that they changed the road there by the stadium to 
Three Championship Drive. Is that right?
    Team member. Yes, that's right.
    The President. It must be pretty intimidating for a team to pull up 
on Three Championship Drive to play.
    I also appreciate most of all the fact that many of the players on 
this team are involved with helping others. I know there is a strong 
commitment to literacy on the team. These women understand that a child 
cannot succeed in America unless they can read, and I appreciate you 
taking your championship status and converting it into something really 
important in our society, besides winning basketball games.
    Swin Cash<Cash, Swin<ls-thn-eq> and Ruth Riley<Riley, 
Ruth<ls-thn-eq> have come to the National Book Festival. I know because 
my wife<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> was the founder of it, and she was most 
appreciative. I appreciate so much the Steps to Success program, which 
gives the players a chance to speak to children about nutrition and 
exercise and self-image. In other words, these players are mentors as 
well as good players. They've achieved an interesting status, a 
championship status, and now they convert it to helping somebody change 
their life or somebody to be loved.
    I appreciate so very much the McKeesport, Pennsylvania, effort. 
Coach,<Laimbeer, William, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> when you had the whole team 
there to distribute 20 tons of food, I mean, it's a really fine example 
of what a champion means.
    And so today it's my honor to welcome to the Rose Garden true 
champs--great athletes and really fine people. Congratulations. I'm glad 
you're here.

Note: The President spoke at 10:08 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to William Laimbeer, Jr., head coach, 
and Ruth Riley, Cheryl Ford, and Swin Cash, players, Detroit Shock; Tom 
Wilson, president and chief executive officer, Palace Sports & 
Entertainment; and Val Ackerman, president, Women's National Basketball 
Association.
