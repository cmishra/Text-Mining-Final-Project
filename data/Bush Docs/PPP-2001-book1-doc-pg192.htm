Statement on the Death of James Rhodes<Rhodes, James<ls-thn-eq>
March 4, 2001

    America and Ohio lost a great man today, Governor Jim Rhodes. Laura 
and I share in this time of mourning with the people of Ohio. Jim was a 
dedicated, honorable public servant. His distinguished career included 
representing Ohio and its people longer than any other Governor in the 
State's history. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughters, 
Suzanne<Rhodes, Suzanne<ls-thn-eq> and Sharon,<Rhodes, Sharon<ls-thn-eq> 
and his entire family.
