Statement on the Appointment of Kenneth L. Wainstein<Wainstein, Kenneth 
L.<ls-thn-eq> as Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and 
Counterterrorism
March 19, 2008

    I am pleased to announce that I have selected Kenneth L. Wainstein 
to serve as Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and 
Counterterrorism. Ken is a proven leader and a dedicated public servant 
with nearly two decades of law enforcement experience, including as 
United States Attorney for the District of Columbia. As Assistant 
Attorney General for National Security, he helped improve our ability to 
confront the threats of a new era. His experience at the Federal Bureau 
of Investiga-

tion as general counsel and Chief of Staff has provided him with a clear 
understanding of the dangers we face and the importance of ensuring that 
we have the necessary tools to protect America.

    In his new role, Ken will coordinate our Nation's homeland security 
efforts to ensure that we continue to make progress on combating 
terrorism, securing our borders, and strengthening our emergency 
preparedness. I look forward to working with Ken to make America safer.
