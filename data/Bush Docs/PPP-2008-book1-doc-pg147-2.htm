Message on the Observance of the Lunar New Year, 2008
February 5, 2008

    I send greetings to those celebrating the Lunar New Year, the Year 
of the Rat.
    Throughout our country and around the world, men and women of Asian 
descent welcome the Lunar New Year with a spirit of giving and renewed 
hope. This holiday, filled with vibrant traditions, celebrates new 
beginnings and recognizes the enduring wisdom of ancestors. During this 
special time of year, millions of people reunite with family and 
friends, reflect on the past, and look forward to a future of prosperity 
and opportunity.
    The Lunar New Year also reminds us of the richness of Asian culture 
and the significance of its history. By preserving and sharing their 
heritage, Asian Americans enhance the American experience and contribute 
to our country's legacy of diversity.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for peace, 
health, and happiness in the New Year.

                                                          George W. Bush
