Statement on the Death of Dr. Benjamin Spock<Spock, Benjamin 
McLane<ls-thn-eq>
March 16, 1998

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Dr. 
Benjamin Spock. For half a century, Dr. Spock guided parents across the 
country and around the world in their most important job--raising their 
children. As a pediatrician, writer, and teacher, Dr. Spock offered sage 
advice and gentle support to generations of families, and he taught all 
of us the importance of respecting children. He was a tireless advocate, 
devoting himself to the cause of improving the lives of children. Our 
thoughts and prayers are with his family.
