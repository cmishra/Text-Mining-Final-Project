Statement on Senate Confirmation of Robert M. Gates<Gates, Robert 
M.<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of Defense
December 6, 2006

    I am pleased the Senate has overwhelmingly voted to confirm Dr. 
Robert Gates as the next Secretary of Defense. In his confirmation 
hearing, Dr. Gates demonstrated he is an experienced, qualified, and 
thoughtful man who is well respected by members of both parties and is 
committed to winning the war on terror. Throughout his career, Dr. Gates 
has transformed the organizations he has led and empowered them to 
successfully address complex issues. I am confident that his leadership 
and capabilities will help our country meet its current military 
challenges and prepare for emerging threats of the 21st century.
    I thank Chairman Warner<Warner, John W.<ls-thn-eq> and Ranking 
Member Levin<Levin, Carl<ls-thn-eq> for leading dignified and 
constructive hearings, and I thank the Senate for moving quickly on this 
nomination.
