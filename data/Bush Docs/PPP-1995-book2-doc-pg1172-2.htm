Statement on Signing the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations and 
Rescissions Legislation
July 28, 1995

    Pursuant to my signature yesterday, I have approved H.R. 1944, the 
Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Additional Disaster 
Assistance, for Anti-terrorism Initiatives, for Assistance in the 
Recovery from the Tragedy that Occurred at Oklahoma City, and 
Rescissions Act, 1995. This legislation shows how we can work together 
to produce good legislation.
    I hereby designate as an emergency all funds in this Act so 
designated by the Congress that I have not previously designated 
pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
    I am pleased that bipartisan leaders of Congress worked with me to 
produce a good bill. Working together, we can continue to produce good 
legislation for the American people.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
