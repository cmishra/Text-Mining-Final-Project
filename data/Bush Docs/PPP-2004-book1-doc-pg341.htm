Statement on the Completion of the Transitional Administrative Law in 
Iraq
March 8, 2004

    I congratulate the Iraqi Governing Council and the Iraqi people on 
completing the Transitional Administrative Law for Iraq. This document 
is an important step toward the establishment of a sovereign government 
on June 30. It lays the foundation for democratic elections and for a 
new constitution, which will be written by an elected Iraqi assembly and 
approved by the Iraqi people.
    This law provides a framework for continued cooperation among Iraq, 
members of the international Coalition, and the United Nations as the 
Iraqi people make progress towards democracy. And it provides the 
essential freedoms and rights to all Iraqis regardless of gender, 
religion, or ethnic origin--including freedom of religion, freedom of 
speech and assembly, the right to a fair trial, and the right to choose 
their own representatives.

    The adoption of this law marks a historic milestone in the Iraqi 
people's long journey from tyranny and violence to liberty and peace. 
While difficult work remains to establish democracy in Iraq, today's 
signing is a critical step in that direction.
