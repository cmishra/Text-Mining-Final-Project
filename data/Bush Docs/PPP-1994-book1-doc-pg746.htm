Statement on the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments
April 21, 1994

    I commend the work already done by Secretary O'Leary, other members 
of the Cabinet, and the many other agency officials on the issue of 
Government-sponsored human radiation experiments which took place during 
the past 50 years. Today's first meeting of the Advisory Committee on 
Human Radiation Experiments is another step by the administration to 
have an honest and open approach to its investigation of the cold-war-
era experiments.
    The Advisory Committee has an important task in determining whether 
the U.S. Government treated its own citizens wrongfully through human 
experimentation. Both those Americans who were the subject of these 
questioned experiments and the scientists who performed them deserve a 
fair and thorough investigation.
    Only by dealing honestly with the past can we hope to build a better 
future.

Note: The Executive order of January 15 which established the Committee 
is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
