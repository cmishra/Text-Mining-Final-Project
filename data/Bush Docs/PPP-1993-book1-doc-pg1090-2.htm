Nomination for Posts at the Department of Energy
July 15, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Martha 
Krebs and Corlis Moody to senior positions at the Department of Energy. 
Krebs will be Director of the Office of Energy Research, and Moody will 
be the Director of the Office of Minority Economic Impact.
    ``It gives me great pleasure to announce these nominations today,'' 
said the President. ``Martha Krebs has demonstrated tremendous 
leadership capacity as an administrator of one of our country's most 
important research facilities and a senior congressional aide. As for 
Corlis Moody, Secretary O'Leary knows better than anyone the high 
quality of work that she has done in the past and is capable of doing at 
the Department of Energy. I welcome both of their service.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
