Letter to the Speaker of the House on the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade
May 3, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    On April 15, the United States and more than one hundred other 
nations signed the Uruguay Round agreement in Marrakesh, Morocco. It is 
the broadest, most comprehensive trade agreement in history.
    For half a century, the United States has led the global effort to 
reduce trade barriers and expand trade. The Uruguay Round, which is 
scheduled to enter into force on January 1, 1995, represents the most 
important step in that effort.
    This agreement will create hundreds of thousands of American jobs 
and new economic opportunities at home. Moreover, it will allow American 
workers and businesses to compete in a freer, fairer, and more effective 
global trading system that lays the foundation for prosperity into the 
next century.
    I intend to transmit legislation to implement the Uruguay Round and 
am committed to seeking bipartisan support for its passage this year.
    The attached booklet describes the Uruguay Round's benefit to 
American workers and firms. I look forward to working with you in the 
months ahead to implement this important agreement.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton
