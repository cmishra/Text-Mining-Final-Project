Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting on Iraq's Compliance With 
United Nations Security Council Resolutions
April 12, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1), and as part of my effort to keep the 
Congress fully informed, I am reporting on the status of efforts to 
obtain Iraq's compliance with various resolutions adopted by the United 
Nations Security Council. The last report, consistent with Public Law 
102-1, was transmitted on January 19, 2001.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Strom Thurmond, President pro tempore of 
the Senate.
