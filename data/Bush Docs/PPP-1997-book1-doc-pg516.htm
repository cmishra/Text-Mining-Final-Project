Memorandum on Excused Absence for Employees Affected by the Flooding of 
the Red River and Its Aftermath
April 30, 1997

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Excused Absence for Employees Affected by the Flooding of the 
Red River and its Aftermath

    I am deeply concerned about the devastating losses caused by the 
flooding of the Red River and the impact on the well-being and 
livelihood of our fellow Americans who have been affected by this 
disaster. Elements of the Federal Government have been mobilized to 
respond to this disaster.
    As part of this effort, I request the heads of executive departments 
and agencies, who have Federal civilian employees in Minnesota, North 
Dakota, and South Dakota in areas designated as disaster areas because 
of the flooding of the Red River and its aftermath, to use their 
discretion to excuse from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, 
any such employee who is faced with a personal emergency because of this 
flood and who can be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This 
policy should also be applied to any employee who is needed for 
emergency law enforcement, relief, or clean-up efforts authorized by 
Federal, State, or local officials having jurisdiction.

                                                      William J. Clinton
