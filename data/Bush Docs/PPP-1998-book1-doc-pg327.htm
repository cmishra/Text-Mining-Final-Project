Statement on the Death of Fred<Friendly, Fred<ls-thn-eq> Friendly
March 4, 1998

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened today to learn of the death of 
Fred Friendly. One of the giants of American journalism, Fred started 
his career in radio, forming a partnership with Edward R. Murrow on the 
radio series ``Hear It Now,'' which became the landmark television

series ``See It Now.'' To this day, the programs Fred produced four 
decades ago rank among the finest journalism of the century, exposing 
the demagoguery of Joe McCarthy, the poverty of migrant farmers, and so 
many other social ills.
    Fred was always willing to challenge the powerful. He led CBS News 
at a time when television was just beginning to demonstrate its power to 
the world. When he left CBS, Fred became a pioneer in public television 
and public television documentaries. In more recent years, he has served 
as the conscience of his industry, exploring the ethics of journalism 
and teaching and training journalists to come. Through his many writings 
and television productions, he succeeded in his goal: to force the 
American public to think.
    Our prayers today are with Fred's wife, Ruth,<Friendly, 
Ruth<ls-thn-eq> and their children.
