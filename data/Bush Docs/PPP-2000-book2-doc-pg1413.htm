    Q.  How long is it going to take, Mr. President?
    The President.  We pledged to each other we would answer no 
questions and offer no comment, and I'd like to set a good example. 
[Laughter]
    Q.  Can you resist us, sir?
    The President.  It's difficult to resist, but I will make it--today,
