Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Request for Fiscal Year 2008 Supplemental Appropriations for Ongoing 
Military and Intelligence Operations and Selected Other International 
Activities
October 22, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2008 
Budgetrequest that will provide additional resources for ongoing 
military and intelligence operations in support of Operation

[[Page 1368]]

Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and selected other 
international activities. These funds will support U.S. efforts to 
improve stability in these regions. This request is also consistent with 
the assessments provided by General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan 
Crocker last month and my Iraq Benchmark Assessment Report, as it 
contains funds to maintain the current pace of operations into FY 2008 
and takes into account plans to redeploy five Army brigades by next 
summer, should conditions on the ground permit.
    This request includes funds to improve the protection of our forces 
by procuring additional Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, which 
have proved highly effective in countering improvised explosive devices. 
It also supports pre-deployment training for ground forces; supports the 
repair, replacement, or supplement of equipment worn out or lost in 
military operations; upgrades equipment based on lessons learned to 
date; replenishes depleted prepositioned stocks; and fills shortages in 
non-deployed units caused by the creation of equipment pools in theater.
    In addition, it helps support our military and their families by 
funding a range of needed services. For example, the request funds the 
development of a sustainable medical and rehabilitation system to 
properly care for our wounded warriors. The request also funds enhanced 
support for servicemembers and their families to mitigate the effect of 
repeated and continued deployments of the all-volunteer force.
    These amendments include funding for urgent and unanticipated 
international programs, including support for extraordinary security and 
operating costs associated with U.S. diplomatic activity in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, for assistance to internally displaced persons in Iraq and 
Iraqi refugees, and to help create political and economic stability in 
Afghanistan.
    I hereby designate the specific proposals in the amounts requested 
herein as emergency requirements. This request represents urgent and 
essential requirements and I encourage you to take up this FY 2008 
funding as soon as possible. The details of the request are set forth in 
the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
