Statement on Senate Action on Anticrime Legislation
August 25, 1994

    The United States Senate made history today. The long, hard wait is 
finally over, and the American people are going to get the action 
against crime they have been demanding for over 6 years.
    I want to thank the members of both parties, in the House and 
Senate, who answered the call of ordinary Americans to get this job 
done.
    With a little good faith and a lot of hard work, Republicans and 
Democrats overcame the partisan divisions and false choices that have 
blocked anticrime efforts time and time again.
    And because they did, children will be safer and parents will 
breathe a little easier. Police officers will no longer be threatened by 
gangs and thugs with easy access to deadly assault weapons designed only 
for war. Violent criminals are going to learn quickly that the revolving 
door on our prisons has been locked and bolted shut.
    This crime bill is going to make every neighborhood in America 
safer, and the bipartisan spirit that produced it should give every 
American hope that we can come together to do the job they sent us here 
to do.
