Remarks Prior to Discussions With President Abdou Diouf of Senegal and 
an Exchange With Reporters
May 23, 1994

    The President. Let me say, it's a great honor for me to have the 
President of Senegal here and to thank him publicly for the leadership 
that his country has shown in promoting democracy and economic market 
reforms and many activities of the United Nations designed to save 
lives. I am very grateful for that, and I look forward to this meeting. 
We've never had an opportunity to talk before, but our two nations have 
had very close and good relationships, and I think we'll continue them.

Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis

    Q. Mr. President, can you tell us something about your remarks this 
afternoon?
    The President. Well, I'll just do the best I can to try to speak on 
behalf of the Nation a word of gratitude and appreciation and farewell 
and perhaps a few personal remarks as well.

Note: The President spoke at 11:31 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
