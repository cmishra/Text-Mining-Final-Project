Statement on Assistance for the Homeless
December 24, 1997

    Today--on the eve of Christmas and the first day of Hanukkah--it is 
important for all Americans to come together as one community and 
remember those who are less fortunate, particularly our fellow citizens 
without the warmth and security of a home. I applaud the many Americans 
who dedicate their lives--and the hundreds and thousands of volunteers 
who work tirelessly--to help provide shelter, food, and dignity to 
homeless men, women, and children.
    As long as there are children waking up in America on Christmas 
morning without the comfort of a warm home, we have more work to do. 
Religious and community organizations are doing their part to help 
alleviate homelessness. The Federal Government must do its share too.
    That is why I have asked Secretary Cuomo to announce today that my 
next budget will provide an additional $327 million for homeless 
assistance--if enacted, one of the largest dollar increases ever. My new 
budget will request $1.15 billion to help move the homeless from the 
streets to self sufficiency--a 40-percent increase over this year. This 
amount includes 34,000 vouchers to help individuals and families who are 
<SUP>1</SUP> now homeless celebrate future holidays in a place they can 
call ``home.'' These funds will help create safer places for our 
children to grow up, more stable families, and a stronger American 
community. I look forward to working with Congress to achieve this 
needed assistance for the homeless.
