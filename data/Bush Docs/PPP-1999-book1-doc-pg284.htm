Radio Remarks on ``Read Across America'' Day
March 1, 1999

    The best and most enjoyable way for children to open their minds is 
by opening a book. This Tuesday America will celebrate ``Read Across 
America'' Day. More than one million people--from baseball star Cal 
Ripken, Jr., to the sailors of the U.S.S. Saipan--will share the joy of 
reading with children in every part of our country. I encourage all 
caring adults to get involved. Read to children on ``Read Across 
America'' Day, and read to them every day. Together, we can make our 
children the best readers in the world.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 2:55 p.m. 
in the Oval Office on February 22 for later broadcast as a public 
service announcement. These remarks were also made available on the 
White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
