Statement on the Japan-United States Civil Aviation Agreement
January 30, 1998

    I am pleased that the United States has reached a landmark agreement 
with Japan that will dramatically increase air service between our 
countries. This agreement will expand a $10 billion market that services 
nearly 12 million passengers and carries well over 1 billion pounds of 
cargo each year. It will allow more U.S. cities to have direct service 
to Japan and give U.S. airlines extensive new rights to fly into and 
beyond Japan. This increased competition means more choices for American 
business travelers and tourists alike.
    Like our agreements on telecommunications and financial services, 
this aviation agreement reflects my policy of opening the world's 
markets in areas where American companies are most competitive. In 
aviation alone, we have already concluded far-reaching agreements with 
Germany, Canada, and 20 other nations. Along with today's agreement, 
these pacts are moving international aviation into a 21st* century where 
consumer needs, not governments, will determine where and how often 
passenger and cargo planes travel.

    I want to thank Secretaries Albright<Albright, Madeleine 
K.<ls-thn-eq> and Slater <Slater, Rodney E.<ls-thn-eq>and the 
negotiators at the Departments of State and Transportation for their 
sustained efforts in reaching this historic agreement.
