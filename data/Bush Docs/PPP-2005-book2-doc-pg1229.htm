Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments
July 15, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2006 budget 
amendments for the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human 
Services; the Environmental Protection Agency; International Assistance 
Programs; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the 
Small Business Administration. In total, these amendments would not 
increase the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2006 
Budget.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
        Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
