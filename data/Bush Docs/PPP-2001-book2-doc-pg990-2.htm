Statement on the Death of Representative Floyd Spence<Spence, 
Floyd>
August 16, 2001

    I am deeply saddened by the loss of my friend Floyd Spence. He was a 
leader of great courage and determination, especially since his double-
lung transplant surgery 13 years ago. As a Congressman, he will be 
remembered as a true friend of the men and women in our armed services 
and a steadfast servant of his fellow South Carolinians. Laura and I 
send our prayers to his wife, Debbie,<Spence, Debbie> and 
Floyd's children and grandchildren.
