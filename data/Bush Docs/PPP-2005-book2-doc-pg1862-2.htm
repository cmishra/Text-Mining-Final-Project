Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation To Help the Gulf Coast 
Rebuild Following Hurricanes Rita and Katrina
December 16, 2005

    I commend the Congress for passing an important part of my 
comprehensive plan to help the citizens of the gulf coast rebuild their 
lives and their livelihoods. The private sector is critical in the 
rebuilding effort, and these tax incentives will help boost investment, 
get people back to work, and return the region to prosperity. Americans 
will continue to stand with our fellow citizens in the gulf coast 
region. I look forward to signing this bill into law.
