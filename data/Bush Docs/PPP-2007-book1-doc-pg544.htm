Remarks at a State Dinner Honoring Queen Elizabeth II<Queen Elizabeth 
II<ls-thn-eq> of the United Kingdom
May 7, 2007

    President Bush. Your Majesty and Your Royal Highness,<Prince 
Philip<ls-thn-eq> distinguished guests: Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and 
I offer you a warm welcome to the White House. We are really glad you're 
here.
    Tonight is the fourth state dinner held in Your Majesty's honor here 
at the White House. On previous such occasions, you've been welcomed by 
President Eisenhower, President Ford, and another President<Bush, George 
H.W.<ls-thn-eq> named Bush. [Laughter] Over your long reign, America and 
Britain have deepened our friendship and strengthened our alliance.
    Our alliance is rooted in the beliefs that we share. We recognize 
that every individual has dignity and matchless value. We believe that 
the most effective governments are those that hold themselves 
accountable to their people. And we know that the advance of freedom is 
the best hope for lasting peace in our world.
    Based on our common values, our two nations are working together for 
the common good. Together, we are supporting young democracies in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. Together, we're confronting global challenges such as 
poverty and disease and terrorism. And together, we're working to build 
a world in which more people can enjoy prosperity and security and 
peace.
    Friendships remain strong when they are continually renewed, and the 
American people appreciate Your Majesty's commitment to our friendship. 
We thank you for helping us celebrate the 400th anniversary of the 
Jamestown settlement. We're confident that Anglo-American friendship 
will endure for centuries to come.
    So, on behalf of the American people, I offer a toast to Your 
Majesty, to Your Royal Highness,<Prince Philip<ls-thn-eq> and to our 
staunch allies, the valiant people of the United Kingdom.
    Queen Elizabeth II. Thank you very much, indeed.
    President Bush. Your turn, Your Majesty.

Note: The President spoke at 8:10 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to Prince Philip, the Duke of 
Edinburgh. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
also included the remarks of Queen Elizabeth II.
