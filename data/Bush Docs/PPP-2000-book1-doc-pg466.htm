Statement on the Congressional Budget Resolution
March 15, 2000

    Today the Republican Congress took a first step on a risky budget 
that threatens to undermine the fiscal discipline that has led to our 
current economic prosperity. The budget blueprint they have endorsed 
fails to strengthen Social Security or Medicare, takes us off the path 
to paying down the debt by 2013, and threatens to slash key priorities 
like education, law enforcement, and the environment. It was the wrong 
approach for America last year--it is the wrong approach for America 
this year.
    Republican leaders should work with me on a responsible budget that 
strengthens Social Security and Medicare, adds a prescription drug 
benefit, pays down the debt by 2013, and invests in education and other 
key priorities. Let's work together to meet America's long-term 
challenges and keep our economy strong.
