strikes one in eight American women, and about 180,000 women in the 
United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1998. Each of us 
has a sister, a daughter, a friend, or in my case, a mother, who has 
fought against it.
    The landmark Breast Cancer Prevention Trial gives us new hope that 
some women at high risk for breast cancer may actually be able to reduce 
their risk of getting this life threatening disease. It is an important 
contribution to our national battle to detect, prevent, treat, and 
finally cure breast cancer for generations of women to come.

Note: In the statement, the President referred to the Breast Cancer 
Prevention Trial, a joint study of the National Cancer Institute and the 
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project.
