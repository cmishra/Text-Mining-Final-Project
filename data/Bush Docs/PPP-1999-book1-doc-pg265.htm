Statement on the Death of Virginia Foster Durr<Durr, Virginia 
Foster>
February 25, 1999

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to hear of the death of Virginia 
Foster Durr. Throughout this century, America's long march toward 
freedom and justice has been the achievement of countless Americans--
black and white--who risked their lives to lead us closer to our most 
cherished ideals. A white woman born to privilege in the Deep South, 
Mrs. Durr refused to turn a blind eye to racism and intolerance in our 
society. Her courage, outspokenness, and steely conviction in the 
earliest days of the civil rights movement helped change this Nation 
forever. Hillary and I feel honored to have known and been inspired by 
this truly great American. Our thoughts and prayers are with her friends 
and family.
