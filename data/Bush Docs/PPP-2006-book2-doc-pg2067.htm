Statement on Israeli Airstrike in Gaza
November 8, 2006

    The United States is deeply saddened by the injuries and loss of 
life in Gaza today. We send our condolences to the families of all those 
affected. We have seen the Israeli Government's apology and understand 
an investigation has begun. We hope it will be completed quickly and 
that appropriate steps will be taken to avoid a repetition of this 
tragic incident. We call on all parties to act with care and restraint 
so as to avoid any harm to innocent civilians.
