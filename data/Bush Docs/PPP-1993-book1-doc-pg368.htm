Nomination for Administrator of the Agency for International Development
March 29, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate Brian Atwood 
as Administrator of the Agency for International Development, U.S. 
International Development Cooperation Agency.
    ``Secretary Christopher and I have concluded that the skills that 
Brian Atwood brings to the State Department are greatly needed at AID,'' 
said the President. ``I am confident that he will be the kind of 
effective administrator that our foreign assistance programs need at 
this time. His proven effectiveness and his commitment to democratic 
change make him an ideal choice.''
