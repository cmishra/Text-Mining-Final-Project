    Mr. Secretary-General, this is my eighth chance to welcome you to 
New York, and I'm honored to do so. You did mention, I'm heading into 
retirement--[laughter]--but it has been a joy to work with you, the 
staff, and many of the leaders here in this hall.
    It is my honor to propose a toast, Mr. Secretary-General, to you and 
to your hard work. May God bless all in the room, and, Mr. Secretary-
General, may God continue to bless you, sir.

Note: The President spoke at 7:45 p.m. at United Nations Headquarters. 
The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also 
included the remarks of Secretary-General Ban.
