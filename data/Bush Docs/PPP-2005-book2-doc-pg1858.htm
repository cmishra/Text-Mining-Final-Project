Remarks at ``Christmas in Washington''
December 11, 2005

    Thank you all. Thank you very much. Laura and I have really enjoyed 
the program tonight. We want to thank all the entertainers for their 
wonderful performances. I thank Dr. Phil<McGraw, Phillip ``Dr. 
Phil''<ls-thn-eq> and Robin<McGraw, Robin<ls-thn-eq> for being such fine 
emcees for this event. I want to thank Carrie Underwood,<Underwood, 
Carrie<ls-thn-eq> CeCe Winans,<Winans, CeCe<ls-thn-eq> Ciara,<Harris, 
Ciara<ls-thn-eq> Jane Monheit,<Monheit, Jane<ls-thn-eq> Rascal Flatts, 
The Click Five, and all the performers and choirs that were here.
    We particularly want to thank George Stevens,<Stevens, George, 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> the executive producer of ``Christmas in Washington,'' 
and his wife, Liz,<Stevens, Elizabeth<ls-thn-eq> as well as Michael 
Stevens,<Stevens, Michael, IV<ls-thn-eq> who's the producer and director 
of ``Christmas in Washington,'' and his wife, Ali,<Stevens,

Washington.'' I thank Dick Parsons,<Parsons, Richard D.<ls-thn-eq> who

    In this season of giving, we count our blessings, and we remember 
that we are called on to do good works for those in need. On a special 
day in Bethlehem, the birth of a child brought hope to the world. And at 
this time of year, we are especially grateful to those whose work brings 
hope and health to children.
    ``Christmas in Washington'' supports the Children's National Medical 
Center. All year long, the doctors and nurses and staff of this hospital 
are providing care, restoring health, and putting the light back into 
the eyes of children. I thank tonight's sponsors and contributors for 
their support of this important work.
    As we celebrate the holidays, we also remember the men and women who 
serve and defend America. Our military men and women and their families 
have the support and the gratitude of our entire Nation.
    To all Americans, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish you a 
joyful and peaceful holiday season. God bless you all, and Merry 
Christmas.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 7 p.m. in the National 
Building Museum. In his remarks, he referred to television host Phillip 
``Dr. Phil'' McGraw, and his wife, Robin; and Laura, wife of Richard D. 
Parsons. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on December 15.
