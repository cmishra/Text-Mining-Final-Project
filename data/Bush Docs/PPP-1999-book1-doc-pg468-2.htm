Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
March 30, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period December 1, 1998, to January 31, 
1999.
    In an important step toward easing tensions on Cyprus, the 
Government of Cyprus announced on December 29 that the S-300 anti-
aircraft missiles that it had ordered from Russia would not be delivered 
to the island. This positive and welcome decision gave important new 
impetus to efforts to reduce tensions and promote a just and lasting 
settlement of the Cyprus dispute.
    The United Nations remained active during the reporting period in 
the effort to resolve the Cyprus dispute. In addition to renewing the 
mandate for the U.N. Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP), the U.N. Security 
Council adopted Resolution 1218 that endorsed the Secretary 
General's<Annan, Kofi> September 30 initiative to reduce 
tensions and promote a just and lasting peace on Cyprus. In a December 
23 statement, I wholeheartedly endorsed Resolution 1218 and directed 
that the United States take all necessary steps to support a sustained 
effort to implement it. As I said then and wish to emphasize now, the 
United States remains deeply committed to finding a viable solution to 
the Cyprus problem.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
