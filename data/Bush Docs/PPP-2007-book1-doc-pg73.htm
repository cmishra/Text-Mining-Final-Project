Statement on the Death of Deborah Orin-Eilbeck<Orin-Eilbeck, 
Deborah<ls-thn-eq>
January 28, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I were saddened to learn of the 
death of Deborah Orin-Eilbeck. Deb had a distinguished, decades-long 
career as a journalist, covering every Presidential campaign since 1980 
and joining the New York Post's Washington bureau in 1988. Deb fought a 
valiant battle against cancer with the same tenacity, devotion, and 
determination that she brought to her work in the White House briefing 
room through numerous administrations.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our condolences to Deb's 
husband, Neville Eilbeck,<Eilbeck, Neville<ls-thn-eq> and to her family, 
friends, and colleagues. She will be missed by all of us at the White 
House who cared deeply for her.
