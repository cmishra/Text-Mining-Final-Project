Statement on the Delivery of the Pan Am Flight 103 Bombing Suspects to 
Dutch Custody
April 5, 1999

    I am gratified that the two <Fhimah, Lamen 
Khalifa>suspects<Megrahi, Abdel Basset Ali al-> 
accused in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 were delivered by the 
United Nations to the custody of Dutch authorities. Legal proceedings 
will now take place in accordance with the U.S.-UK initiative for a 
Scottish trial before a Scottish court sitting in The Netherlands.
    The terrorist bombing of Pan Am 103 provoked outrage the world over. 
It led to more than 10 years of effort by the United States and United 
Kingdom, with the support of other nations, to bring the suspects to 
justice.
    I am especially thankful for the repeated intervention of U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan,<Annan, Kofi> who worked 
tirelessly to implement the Security Council resolutions. I am also 
deeply grateful for the efforts of President Mandela,<Mandela, 
Nelson> President Mubarak,<Mubarak, Hosni> and the 
Saudi Ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar,<Prince 
Bandar> on behalf of King Fahd<King Fahd> and Crown 
Prince Abdullah.<Prince Abdullah (of Saudi Arabia)>
    But most important, today is a day to remember the men and women who 
lost their lives on Pan Am 103. I know their loved ones have suffered 
greatly. They, too, have labored hard to bring justice. Last December, 
on the 10th anniversary of the bombing, I renewed my pledge to the 
families that I would make my best efforts to bring the accused to 
trial. Now, at last, the road to justice has begun.

Note: The President referred to suspects Lamen Khalifa Fhimah and Abdel 
Basset Ali al-Megrahi; President Nelson Mandela of South Africa; and 
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
