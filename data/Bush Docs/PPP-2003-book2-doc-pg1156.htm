Statement on the Death of Johnny Cash<Cash, Johnny<ls-thn-eq>
September 12, 2003

    Johnny Cash was a music legend and American icon whose career 
spanned decades and genres. His resonant voice and human compassion 
reached the hearts and souls of generations, and he will be missed. 
Laura joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his family.
