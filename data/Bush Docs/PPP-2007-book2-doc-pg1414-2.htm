Remarks on Arrival in Columbia, South Carolina
November 2, 2007

    The President. I want to thank the Governor<Sanford, Mark<ls-thn-eq> 
and the Senators and Members of Congress for joining me.
    I first do want to say how concerned Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
and I are for the families who lost loved ones at the fire in Ocean Isle 
Beach, North Carolina. I know people are hurting when they think about 
the seven youngsters who had so much hope in their lives and had their 
life taken during that fire. I hope the families and loved ones can take 
comfort that in this great State and around the Nation, there's a lot of 
people praying for them.

    I'm proud to stand with Senator Lindsey Graham.<Graham, Lindsey 
O.<ls-thn-eq> I've gotten to know him well. He deserves to be reelected 
to the United States Senate in--from South Carolina. He's tough; he is 
smart; he bases his votes on conservative principles. And Senator 
Graham, I'm proud to call you friend.
    Senator Lindsey O. Graham. Thank you, sir.
    The President. And I believe the people of South Carolina benefit 
from your leadership as the Senator from this important State.
    Lindsey Graham<Graham, Lindsey O.<ls-thn-eq> understands that low 
taxes work when it comes to growing this economy. Earlier this week, we 
had the reports that progrowth economic policies that Senator Graham 
supports are making a difference for America. After all, the third 
quarter numbers were strong. Today we had further good news, that 
keeping taxes low works. This economy added 166,000 new jobs during the 
month of October, which is now our 50th consecutive month of 
uninterrupted job growth, the longest in the Nation's history. I 
appreciate your strong support for keeping taxes low on the working 
people in South Carolina, Senator.
    Lindsey Graham<Graham, Lindsey O.<ls-thn-eq> is no better friend to 
the United States military and to our veterans. I'm looking forward to 
going to Fort Jackson today. It is fitting that I'm going with Senator 
Lindsey Graham. He cares deeply about those who volunteered to serve our 
Nation, and he's a strong supporter of the Nation's veterans.
    And finally, I appreciate his work on the Judiciary Committee in the 
United States Senate. I told the people of South Carolina if I became 
the President of the United States that I would put people on the bench 
who would strictly interpret the Constitution and not legislate from the 
bench. I've kept that pledge. And I've had no stronger supporter in the 
United States Senate than Lindsey Graham<Graham, Lindsey O.<ls-thn-eq> 
for putting good judges on the bench. The people of this State have got 
to understand that when I nominated John Roberts<Roberts, John G., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and Sam Alito,<Alito, Samuel A., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> there was 
no better ally than Lindsey Graham to see to it that these two good men 
were confirmed.
    There's going to be another fight on the Senate floor coming next 
week. The Senate Judiciary Committee has agreed to vote on the 
nomination of Michael Mukasey<Mukasey, Michael B.<ls-thn-eq> to be the 
Attorney General. And Senator Graham,<Graham, Lindsey O.<ls-thn-eq> I 
appreciate your strong support for Mike Mukasey. He's a good man, he's a 
fair man, he's an independent man, and he's plenty qualified to be the 
Attorney General. And I strongly urge the United States Senate to 
confirm this man, so that I can have an Attorney General to work with to 
protect the United States of America from further attack.
    Proud to be with you, Senator.<Graham, Lindsey O.<ls-thn-eq> I 
strongly believe the people of South Carolina should send you back to 
the United States Senate.
    Sen. Graham.<Graham, Lindsey O.<ls-thn-eq> Thank you very much, Mr. 
President.

Note: The President spoke at 10:39 a.m. at the Columbia Metropolitan 
Airport. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. Mark C. Sanford, Jr., of 
South Carolina.
