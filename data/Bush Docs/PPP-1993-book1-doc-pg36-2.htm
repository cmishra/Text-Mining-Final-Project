Urban Development

    The President today nominated four recognized leaders in the housing 
field to work with Secretary Henry Cisneros as top officials at the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The nominees for Deputy 
Secretary and three Assistant Secretary positions are recognized and 
experienced leaders in the housing field.
    As Deputy Secretary, the President nominated Terry Duvernay,

Chief of Staff under Secretary Moon Landrieu. Also nominated were Andrew

of communications for The Enterprise Foundation, a national foundation 
that works to provide housing for low-income people, to be Assistant 
Secretary for Public Affairs.
    ``I am committed,'' said the President, ``as is Secretary Cisneros, 
to turning the Department of Housing and Urban Development into a center 
for action and a home for innovation. Terry Duvernay, Andrew Cuomo, 
Roberta Achtenberg, and Jean Nolan have a big task ahead of them--
rebuilding housing opportunity for all Americans and repairing the torn 
fabric of our nation's urban communities. These four outstanding 
individuals have the experience, the knowledge, and the ability to make 
that happen. They will be an essential part of my team.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
