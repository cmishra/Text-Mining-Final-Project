Statement on the Death of Representative Thomas P. Lantos<Lantos, Thomas 
P.<ls-thn-eq>
February 11, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by the death of our 
friend, Congressman Tom Lantos.
    Tom was a man of character and a champion of human rights. After 
immigrating to America more than six decades ago, he worked to help 
oppressed people around the world have the opportunity to live in 
freedom. As the only Holocaust survivor to serve in Congress, Tom was a 
living reminder that we must never turn a blind eye to the suffering of 
the innocent at the hands of evil men. I appreciate his vision in 
cofounding the Human Rights Caucus. I also appreciate his efforts to 
protect our environment, alleviate the sufferings caused by HIV/AIDS, 
and strengthen our friendships and alliances around the globe.
    We will miss Tom's leadership in the Halls of Congress. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with his wife Annette,<Lantos, Annette<ls-thn-eq> 
their<Dick, Annette<ls-thn-eq> daughters,<Swett, Katrina<ls-thn-eq> and 
the rest of the Lantos family.

Note: The statement referred to Annette Lantos Tillemann-Dick and 
Katrina Lantos Swett, daughters of Rep. Lantos.
