Remarks to Participants of the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride
April 24, 2008

    Thanks for coming. Doocy,<Doocy, Steve<ls-thn-eq> thanks for the 
introduction. This has got to be one of the most inspiring athletic 
events in our Nation's history. At least it is for me, and I hope it is 
for you.
    I was going to ride with the guys today, but Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> told me I probably wouldn't be able to keep up. 
[Laughter] I'm--there is no doubt in my mind the people behind me are 
some of the most bravest people in our country's history. I admire their 
courage; I admire their determination. We're honored to have you here.
    I'm also joined by the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice.<Rice, 
Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> Thank you for coming, Madam Secretary. Secretary 
Jim Peake<Peake, James B.<ls-thn-eq> of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs is with us. Deputy Secretary Gordon England<England, 
Gordon<ls-thn-eq> is with us. Admiral Mike Mullen,<Mullen, Michael 
G.<ls-thn-eq> Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, are here--other members of 
my administration and Members of Congress. The reason they're there is 
the same reason I'm here: We love and respect our military. And I thank 
you for coming.
    I want to thank Granger Smith<Smith, Granger<ls-thn-eq> and the band 
for joining us today. Thanks for being here.
    I appreciate those who wear the uniform who have joined us. I'm 
proud of you. Thanks for serving. I want to thank the

wounded warriors. I want to thank their caregivers from Walter Reed and 
Bethesda. I appreciate the members of the Wounded Warrior Project. And I 
want to thank the family members and friends who are here today. Welcome 
to the White House.
    Four years ago, Chris Carney<Carney, Chris<ls-thn-eq> decided to 
ride coast to coast to raise awareness and money for our wounded 
warriors. In the first year, he biked more than 5,000 miles from Long 
Island to the Pacific Ocean and raised more than a million dollars for 
the Wounded Warrior Project. He started what's called the annual Soldier 
Ride.
    Next year, wounded vets started coming along. In 2006, 75 wounded 
warriors took turns riding portions of the cross-country journey. These 
service men and women rode to raise money for their fellow soldiers, 
including those who were hurt too much to ride. And they also rode to 
show themselves what they could do. And in so doing, they showed the 
world what they could do.
    Americans came out to cheer. More soldiers and supporters came out 
to ride. More Americans then came out to show their support, so the 
Soldier Ride started doing different races around the country so even 
more of our citizens could participate. Today hundreds of people have 
gathered here on the South Lawn to kick off this ride, and I want to 
thank you all for being here.
    The 3-day bike ride you're starting today at the White House says a 
lot. It says that you're showing that even when you're wounded, you're 
not done fighting. One of the riders today is Marine Corporal Chad 
Watson.<Watson, Chad M.<ls-thn-eq> I've gotten to know Chad. I met him 
when I was at Walter Reed 3 weeks after his Humvee was hit with an IED 
on patrol in Fallujah. He lost his right leg; he shattered his left 
ankle and foot; he took shrapnel to his face. And when I went into his 
room, he wanted to stand at attention and shake hands with the Commander 
in Chief, as well as salute.
    He<Watson, Chad M.<ls-thn-eq> got up to his walker--his 
daddy<Watson, Mike<ls-thn-eq> helped him and so did his<Watson, 
Brandon<ls-thn-eq> brother--he held himself upright with his arm 
strength while a fellow marine read his accommodation, and I had the 
honor of giving him the Purple Heart.
    I told him to sit down. He<Watson, Chad M.<ls-thn-eq> didn't want 
to; he was a marine. And now he's here. He's got a new leg, and thanks 
to that leg, Chad will be able to start on even a greater journey than 
the one he begins today. This summer, he's going to walk down the aisle 
to get married to his beautiful bride.<Kinsella, Jillian<ls-thn-eq> 
We're glad you're here.
    The technology that you're witnessing today is helping our troops 
regain their lives. And it's state of the art, and that's the way it 
should be. We owe those who wear the uniform all the support they can 
possibly have. We'll give them the best medical care. And for the docs 
and nurses here, there's no doubt in my mind, our troops get the best 
medical care possible.
    We owe them the best prosthesis. And if there's a new advance, it 
will be made available for our folks. We owe them a Veterans Health 
Administration that's seamless and works well. We owe them our thanks.
    These servicemembers are focused on what you have to give than what 
you've lost. I appreciate the spirit of those in the Soldier Ride.
    I thank my fellow citizens for supporting our troops. I appreciate 
the fact that the families have stood by those who wear the uniform. I 
appreciate your loved ones who are here today to cheer you on. The 
riders represent the spirit of the strongest military in the world and 
the greatest country on Earth. I'm thankful that we have brave men and 
women like you who step forward to protect America. I'm proud to be your 
Commander in Chief.
    And now let us get started. God bless you.

Note: The President spoke at 3:26 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his

and Friends''; Chris Carney, founder, Wounded Warrior Project Soldier
