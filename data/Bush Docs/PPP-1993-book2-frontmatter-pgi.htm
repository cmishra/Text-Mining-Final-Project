                                Foreword

    During the second half of 1993, the American people continued to 
confront vast changes around the world and here at home. We found the 
courage to move forward as a Nation, striving to build better lives for 
ourselves and our children and to chart America's course into the 21st 
century.

    As these papers document, we continued to make the changes necessary 
to empower the American people to move ahead with confidence. The 
Congress enacted our Administration's economic plan, providing the 
largest cut in the Federal budget deficit in history and increasing 
investments to help hardworking Americans meet the challenges of the 
world economy. After a vigorous debate, the Congress enacted the North 
American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, forging ties among 
our countries that will help us all compete and win around the world.

    As business responded favorably to the changes in our country's 
economic policy, we strove to change the way our government does the 
people's business as well. Following Vice President Gore's 
recommendations in the National Performance Review, we began to reinvent 
our government to make it more efficient and more effective for the 
American people, streamlining the Federal workforce, giving more 
responsibility to frontline workers, and making the regulatory process 
less costly, more accountable, and more efficient.

    We recognized, too, that government can only do so much. The 
greatest responsibility for renewing the American Dream and restoring 
our spirit of community belongs to the American people themselves. In 
signing legislation creating a new national service program, AmeriCorps, 
I asked all Americans to seize the opportunity ``to reach beyond 
themselves and to reach out to others and to make things better.'' In 
the final analysis, the most lasting changes must come from the 
individual acts of all Americans. At the Church of God in Christ in 
Memphis, Tennessee, where the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., had 
delivered the last speech of his lifetime, I asked our fellow citizens 
to remember that, without spiritual renewal, ``none of the things we 
seek to do will ever take us where we need to go.''

    We all were reminded of the hopeful possibilities of our times when 
we witnessed an historic act of reconciliation that American diplomacy 
helped foster. The Prime Minister of Israel and the Chairman of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization came to the White House for a 
handshake of hope and a declaration of principles to put an end to their 
ancient conflict. America and the world saw how much we can all 
accomplish when we decide to move forward together.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period August 1-December 31, 1993. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush are 
also available.
