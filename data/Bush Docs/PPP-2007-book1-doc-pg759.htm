Remarks on Arrival in Wichita, Kansas
June 15, 2007

    Thank you all for coming out to say hello. Thank you for making this 
a really comfortable airplane. [Laughter] I can't tell you what an honor 
it is to fly overseas in Air Force One and have that big bird park, have 
people around the world see the great majesty of our country reflected 
in this airplane.

    And I know many of you are working hard to outfit the--its 
companion. I appreciate your hard work. I will assure you one thing: I 
will ride that airplane with greatpride. I mean, there's nothing better 
than representing the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.
    I appreciate your hard work. Thanks for coming out to say hello. I'd 
like to kind of work along here and make sure I don't lose my touch and 
shake a few hands. I'm honored to be here with Senator Pat 
Roberts<Roberts, Charles P. ``Pat''<ls-thn-eq> and Vicki Tiahrt.<Tiahrt, 
Vicki<ls-thn-eq> They're strong supporters of the programs here, strong 
supporters of Boeing.

    I appreciate you coming out to say hello. And I ask for God's 
blessings on your families and on our country. Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 11:30 a.m. at McConnell Air Force Base. In 
his remarks, he referred to Vicki Tiahrt, wife of Rep. Todd Tiahrt of
