Statement on Federal Law Enforcement Efforts in the Nevada Biological 
Materials Case
February 19, 1998

    I have been briefed by the Attorney General<Reno, Janet<ls-thn-eq> 
on today's arrests in Nevada, and we will continue to monitor the 
situation. I cannot comment on the details of this ongoing law 
enforcement effort, but let me say this:
    All Americans should be deeply grateful to the brave law enforcement 
officers, especially the agents of the FBI, for their excellent work in 
this case. It is important for the American people to understand that 
their law enforcement officials have this situation under control. All 
materials have been seized and are being analyzed to determine if they 
are in any way threatening.
