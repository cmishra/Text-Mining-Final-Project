Statement on the Resolution of the United Auto Workers Strike at
General Motors
July 28, 1998

    I am pleased that the United Auto Workers and General Motors have 
resolved their differences today. Getting GM back to work is a win-win 
solution--a victory for the company and its employees and a victory for 
all Americans. It also shows that the collective bargaining process 
works. American companies can remain competitive in the world economy 
while providing good jobs and good benefits for their employees.
    I would like to thank Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, who worked 
night and day behind the scenes to keep both parties working toward a 
resolution. She and her team deserve a great deal of credit for their 
patience and determination in the effort to help bring this dispute to a 
close.
