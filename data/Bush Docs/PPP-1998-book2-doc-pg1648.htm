Statement on the United Nations Security Council Resolution on Kosovo
September 23, 1998

    Today's U.N. Security Council resolution makes absolutely clear that 
the international community is determined to see an end to the violence 
and repression in Kosovo. The resolution places responsibility squarely 
on President Milosevic to take the concrete steps necessary to prevent a 
major humanitarian disaster and restore peace in the region.
    I am particularly encouraged that the resolution, adopted under 
Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, makes clear that the deterioration of 
the situation in Kosovo constitutes a threat to regional peace and 
security.
    The United States and its allies are moving NATO activities from the 
planning stage to readiness to act. With more than 250,000 Kosovars 
displaced from their homes and cold weather coming, Milosevic must act 
immediately to heed the will of the international community.

Note: The statement referred to President Slobodan Milosevic of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
