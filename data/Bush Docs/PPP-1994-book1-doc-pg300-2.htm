Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report on Radiation Control for 
Health and Safety
February 22, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 540 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360qq) (previously section 360D of the Public 
Health Service Act), I am submitting the report of the Department of 
Health and Human Services regarding the administration of the Radiation 
Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 during calendar year 1992.
    The report recommends the repeal of section 540 of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act that requires the completion of this annual 
report. All the information found in this report is available to the 
Congress on a more immediate basis through the Center for Devices and 
Radiological Health technical reports, the Radiological Health Bulletin 
and other publicly available sources. This annual report serves little 
useful purpose and diverts Agency resources from more productive 
activities.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 22, 1994.
