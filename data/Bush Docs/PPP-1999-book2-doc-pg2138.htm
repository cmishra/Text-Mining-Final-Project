Statement on the 1999 Uniform Crime Report
November 21, 1999

    The preliminary 1999 uniform crime report released by the FBI today 
            shows that we are making enormous progress in our national 
            strategy to fight crime. America continues to experience the 
            longest continuous decline in crime on record. Overall crime 
            fell another 10 percent in the first 6 months of this year 
            as compared to the first half of 1998, twice as much as any 
            other 6-month period over the last decade. We have the 
            lowest crime rate in 25 years. We have the lowest homicide 
            rate in over 31 years. In every region of our Nation, 
            neighborhoods are safer now, and American families are more 
            secure than they have been in a generation.

    But to keep crime rates down we must remain vigilant. Since I took 
office, my administration has focused on a simple but effective crime-
fighting strategy: 100,000 more police officers and fewer guns in the 
hands of criminals. Today's report shows that our strategy is making a 
difference. That is why I am pleased that the budget agreement reached 
last week will extend our successful COPS initiative into the 21st 
century, helping put up to 50,000 more police officers on our streets, 
creating new community prosecutors, and providing more resources for 
crime-fighting technologies. Congress must now do its part to reduce gun 
violence and crime, by making the passage of commonsense gun laws the 
first order of business when it reconvenes.

Note: This statement was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on November 19 but was embargoed for release until 6 p.m., 
November 21.
