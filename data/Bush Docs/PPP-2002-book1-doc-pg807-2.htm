Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Funding for the 
Disaster Relief Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
May 15, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    In accordance with provisions of Public Law 107-73, the Departments 
of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002, I hereby request and make available 
$500 million for the Disaster Relief program of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA).
    These funds will allow FEMA to continue providing assistance to 
victims of disasters in several States, including victims of recent 
tornadoes in Maryland and storms and flooding in Kentucky, Tennessee, 
and Virginia. These funds also would be available for ongoing response 
to prior disasters and to ensure that FEMA has resources on hand to 
provide timely response to future disasters.
    I designate the $500 million made available today as an emergency 
requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his 
comments and observations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
