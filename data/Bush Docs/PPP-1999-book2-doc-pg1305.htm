Statement on the Death of King Hassan II<King Hassan II> of 
Morocco
July 23, 1999

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn that His Majesty King 
Hassan II of Morocco has passed away. The prayers of all Americans go 
out to the royal family and the people of Morocco.
    Over his 38-year reign, King Hassan II demonstrated time and again 
his leadership, his courage, and his willingness to embrace change. He 
worked tirelessly to promote the welfare of his people, and in recent 
years he took important steps to deepen freedom in his country.
    He offered wise counsel to every U.S. President since John F. 
Kennedy. He worked to break down barriers among the peoples of the 
Middle East, bravely opening a dialog with Israel, helping to arrange 
President Sadat's historic journey to Jerusalem, seeking greater 
tolerance and stability across the region.
    Hillary<Clinton, Hillary Rodham> had the honor of being 
his guest just a few months ago. We will never forget his extraordinary 
hospitality nor the many times he stood shoulder to shoulder with the 
United States.
    King Sidi Mohammed<King Mohammed VI> and the Moroccan 
people can continue to count on the support of the United States. To 
King Sidi Mohammed, to the rest of the royal family, and to the people 
of Morocco, Hillary and I send our heartfelt condolences.
    The Middle East has lost one of its greatest peacemakers. In his 
honor, we must rededicate ourselves to fulfilling his vision: a just and 
lasting peace for all the Middle East's children.
