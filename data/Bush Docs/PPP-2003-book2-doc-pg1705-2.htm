    Bob Bartley was a giant of journalism. His extraordinary 
contributions to America as an author, editor, and columnist helped 
shape our times. I was pleased to award him the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom, our highest civil honor, in recognition of his enormous impact 
on the intellectual and political life of our Nation. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending condolences to Edith<Bartley, 
Edith<ls-thn-eq> and his daughters, family, colleagues, and friends.
