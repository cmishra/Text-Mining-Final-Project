Statement on the 40th Anniversary of the Death of President John F. 
Kennedy
November 21, 2003

    This weekend the American people turn our thoughts to images of 40 
years ago and to the good and graceful life that ended on November 22, 
1963. John F. Kennedy has been gone nearly as long as he lived, yet the 
memory of him still brings pride to our Nation and a feeling of loss 
that defies the passing of years.
    We remember a man who welcomed great responsibilities and had a gift 
for awakening the idealism and sense of duty in others. We remember a 
leader who called our Nation to high purpose and saw America through 
grave dangers with calm, discernment, and personal courage. We recall, 
with much affection and respect, the charming and dignified manner that 
became familiar to us all in the years of President Kennedy's service.
    On this day especially, we think of a young father whose wife and 
family faced sorrow with dignity and a courage of their own. America 
still misses our 35th President, and Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
join our fellow citizens in honoring the memory of John Fitzgerald 
Kennedy.
