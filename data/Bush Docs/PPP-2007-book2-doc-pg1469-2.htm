Remarks at a Dinner Honoring America's Promise Alliance
November 13, 2007

    Good evening. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I welcome you all to 
the White House; sure glad you're here. Ten years ago, a group of 
spirited citizens came together in the hope that they could make a 
difference in the lives of our Nation's children. In the decade that 
followed, that hope became a dream, the dream became a mission, and that 
mission helped change the lives of countless children across our 
country.
    Through your mentoring programs and your work with at-risk youth,

Promise has given opportunity to young Americans who never had it. You 
have put hope in the eyes of children who have never known it, and you 
have helped make real the promise of our Creator, that there is value 
and purpose in every single human life.
    The success of America's Promise is a tribute to the giving hearts 
of every person in this room, particularly those we honor with awards 
tonight. Yet I think all of us would agree that two people here deserve 
special mention, and they are Colin<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> and Alma 
Powell.<Powell, Alma<ls-thn-eq>
    Throughout their lives, the<Powell, Alma<ls-thn-eq> Powells<Powell, 
Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> have answered our country's call. They've served our 
Nation in times of peace and war, and they have led, taught, and 
inspired Americans along the way. Not a bad record for two people who 
met 46 years ago only because their friends talked them into going into 
a--going on a blind date. [Laughter] Mr. Secretary and Alma, our country 
is fortunate that you both had such persuasive friends. [Laughter]
    I'd like to propose a toast to America's Promise, in gratitude for 
your first decade of public service, and a toast to America's children 
and a future that brings them love and peace and possibility.

Note: The President spoke at 7:43 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to former Secretary of State 
Colin L. Powell and his wife Alma, founding chair and current chair, 
board of directors, America's Promise Alliance.
