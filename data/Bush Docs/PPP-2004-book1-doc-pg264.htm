Statement on Senate Action To Block Medical Liability Reform
February 24, 2004

    I am disappointed that a minority in the Senate has again decided to 
play politics and block our Nation's ability to accomplish medical 
liability reform.
    Today's vote is a blow to America's families, because pregnant women 
are losing access to their obstetricians and gynecologists due to 
frivolous and abusive lawsuits. Pregnant women who need prenatal and 
obstetric health care services deserve access to doctors in their own 
communities. Without the passage of reasonable reforms,

the Nation's badly broken medical liability system will continue to 
drive physicians like obstetricians and gynecologists out of the 
practice of medicine and drive up the costs of health care for all 
Americans. For the benefit of America's families and for the sake of our 
health care system, there needs to be medical liability reform this 
year.
