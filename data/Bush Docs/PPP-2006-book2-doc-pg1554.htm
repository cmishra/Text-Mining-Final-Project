Message on the 90th Anniversary of the National Park Service
August 24, 2006

    I send greetings to those celebrating the 90th anniversary of the 
National Park Service.
    Americans take great pride in our country's natural and historic 
treasures, and the National Park Service plays an important role in 
ensuring that our rich heritage is preserved and enjoyed for generations 
to come. Since its establishment in 1916, the National Park Service has 
grown to include almost 400 sites, with parks in nearly every state. 
These parks protect beautiful landscapes, tell important stories about 
our country's past, and encourage our citizens to conserve our natural 
environment and celebrate our national history.
    Over the past five years, the National Park Service has made 
significant progress in conserving our natural resources and improving 
the condition of park facilities. I call on all Americans to help in 
these efforts and to enhance our parks as we get ready for the National 
Park Service's centennial celebration. Through continued cooperation and 
partnership, our national parks can endure for the next 100 years and 
beyond.
    I appreciate the volunteers and employees of the National Park 
Service who dedicate their time and talents to maintaining and enhancing 
our national parks. Your efforts help advance environmental stewardship, 
promote outdoor recreation, and preserve our national memory.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes on this 
special occasion.

                                                          George W. Bush
