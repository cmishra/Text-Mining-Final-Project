Statement on Signing Legislation To Expand the Women's Rights National 
Historical Park
August 8, 2000

    I am pleased today to sign S. 1910, bipartisan legislation to expand 
the Women's Rights National Historical Park, in Seneca Falls and 
Waterloo, New York, with the addition of the home of Jane Hunt. In 1848 
early supporters of women's rights, meeting at Hunt's home, resolved to 
convene the Nation's first women's rights convention. A century and a 
half later, the addition of the Hunt House to the historical park is a 
fitting tribute to all those who have engaged in the struggle for 
women's rights. With this legislation, this historic home will be 
purchased by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and donated to 
the National Park Service. Jane Hunt made a tremendous difference in the 
lives of American women, and this legislation will ensure that her 
efforts are remembered and honored in the years ahead.

Note: S. 1910, approved August 8, was assigned Public Law No. 106-258.
