Statement Calling for Prompt Senate Consideration of Judicial Nominees
May 9, 2005

    Four years ago today, I nominated Justice Priscilla Owen<Owen, 
Priscilla Richman<ls-thn-eq> and Judge Terry Boyle<Boyle, Terence 
W.<ls-thn-eq> to serve on the Federal courts of appeals. Four years 
later, neither has received an up-or-down vote in the Senate. Both have 
been rated well-qualified by the American Bar Association, the highest 
ABA rating a judicial nominee can receive. Both have been waiting to 
fill vacancies that have been designated judicial emergencies by the 
Judicial Conference of the United States. Much more than enough time has 
passed for the Senate to consider these nominations. The Senate should 
give these extraordinarily qualified nominees the up-or-down votes they 
deserve without further delay.
    It is only fair that the Senate promptly consider judicial nominees 
on the floor, discuss and debate their qualifications, and then vote to 
confirm or not to confirm them. Nominees who have the support of a 
majority of the Senate should be confirmed. Unfortunately, a minority of 
Senators is blocking the will of the Senate.

    Over the course of the past 4 years, the blocking of judicial 
nominees in the Senate has escalated to an unprecedented level. Last 
Congress, 10 of my appeals court nominees were filibustered. Each of 
these highly qualified nominees enjoyed the bipartisan support of a 
majority of Senators. Each would have been confirmed if given a simple 
up-or-down vote. Each deserved a simple up-or-down vote by the entire 
Senate.

    I urge the Senate to put aside the partisan practices of the past 
and work together to ensure that all nominees are treated fairly and 
that all Americans receive timely justice in our Federal courts.
