Letter to Congressional Leaders on Army Force Sufficiency
May 20, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    As required in section 403 of the 1994 National Defense 
Authorization Act, I am hereby certifying that the Army is capable of 
providing sufficient forces (excluding forces engaged in peacekeeping 
operations and other operations other than war) to carry out two major 
regional conflicts nearly simultaneously, in accordance with the 
National Military Strategy.
    Moreover, the attached report specifies the active Army units 
anticipated to deploy within the first 75 days in response to a major 
regional conflict that are currently engaged in peacekeeping operations 
and other operations other than war. The report also specifies my 
estimate of the time required to redeploy and retrain those forces.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
