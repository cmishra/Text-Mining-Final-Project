Statement on the Death of Edward G. Robinson<Robinson, Edward 
G.<ls-thn-eq>
April 4, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened to learn of the 
death of Eddie Robinson. Eddie Robinson was a football legend who 
compiled an amazing record as the coach at Grambling State University. 
He will be remembered for his passion for the game and his dedication to 
helping his players better themselves on the field, in the classroom, 
and in their communities. Laura and I extend our deepest sympathies to 
the Robinson family, the players he inspired, and Grambling State 
University.
