Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report of the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting
March 18, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:
    As required by section 19(3) of the Public Telecommunications Act of 
1992 (Public Law 102-356), I transmit herewith a report of the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This report outlines, first, the 
Corporation's efforts to facilitate the continued development of 
superior, diverse, and innovative programming and, second, the 
Corporation's efforts to solicit the views of the public on current 
programming initiatives.
    This report summarizes 1997 programming decisions and outlines how 
Corporation funds were distributed--$47.9 million for television program 
development, $18.8 million for radio programming development, and $15.6 
million for general system support. The report also reviews the 
Corporation's Open to the Public campaign which allows the public to 
submit comments via mail, a 24-hour toll-free telephone line, or the 
Corporation's Internet website.
    I am confident this year's report will meet with your approval and 
commend, as always, the Corporation's efforts to deliver consistently 
high quality programming that brings together American families and 
enriches all our lives.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

March 18, 1999.
