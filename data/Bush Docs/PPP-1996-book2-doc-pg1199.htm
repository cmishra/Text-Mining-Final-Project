Statement on Senate Action on Food Quality Protection Legislation
July 24, 1996

    I am pleased that the Senate tonight passed the Food Quality 
Protection Act. Americans have every right to expect the world's most 
bountiful food supply will also be the world's safest. Earlier this 
month, I announced tough new measures to improve meat and poultry 
safety. Meeting goals I set early in my administration to strengthen our 
pesticide laws, this legislation is another major step forward. It puts 
in place a strong health-based standard, provides special safeguards for 
children, and protects our health and safety using the best science 
available. This bill demonstrates how Congress and the administration 
can work together to help farmers and consumers, and I look forward to 
signing it.
