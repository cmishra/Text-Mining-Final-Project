Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Aeronautics and Space 
Activities
September 14, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:
    I am pleased to transmit this report on the Nation's achievements in 
aeronautics and space during fiscal year (FY) 1997, as required under 
section 206 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 2476). Aeronautics and space activities involved 13 
contributing departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and the 
results of their ongoing research and development affect the Nation in 
many ways.
    A wide variety of aeronautics and space developments took place 
during FY 1997. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
successfully completed eight Space Shuttle flights. There were 23 
successful U.S. Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launches in FY 1997. Of 
those, 4 were NASA-managed missions, 2 were NASA-funded/Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA)-licensed missions, 5 were Department of Defense-
managed missions, and 12 were FAA-licensed commercial launches. The Mars 
Pathfinder spacecraft and Sojourner rover captured the public's 
attention with a very successful mission. Scientists also made some 
dramatic new discoveries in various space-related fields such as space 
science, Earth science and remote sensing, and life and microgravity 
science. In aeronautics, activities included work on high-speed 
research, advanced subsonic technology, and technologies designed to 
improve the safety and efficiency of our commercial airlines and air 
traffic control system.
    Close international cooperation with Russia occurred on the Shuttle-
Mir docking missions and on the International Space Station program. The 
United States also entered into new forms of cooperation with its 
partners in Europe, South America, and Asia.
    Thus, FY 1997 was a very successful one for U.S. aeronautics and 
space program. Efforts in these areas have contributed significantly to 
the Nation's scientific and technical knowledge, international 
cooperation, a healthier environment, and a more competitive economy.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

September 14, 1998.
