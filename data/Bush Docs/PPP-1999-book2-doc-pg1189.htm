Statement on the Congo Conflict Cease-Fire Agreement
July 12, 1999

    I salute the leaders of Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
(DROC), Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe for their courage and 
commitment to peace in agreeing to the terms for a cease-fire in the 
Congo war. The signing of this agreement in Lusaka on July 10 provides 
hope for the many innocent civilians who have suffered through one of 
Africa's most dangerous and divisive wars in modern times.
    Zambian President Chiluba<Chiluba, Frederick> also 
deserves special tribute for his role in mediating and facilitating the 
Lusaka peace talks and for his continuing efforts to urge rebel factions 
to support the cease-fire agreement. I urge all rebel groups to commit 
to peace and sign on to this important accord.
    We have worked with all parties to encourage the resolution of their 
differences through dialog and negotiations. We will work closely with 
our partners in Africa, the international community, and the United 
Nations to support this agreement. We hope that its full implementation, 
including the disarming of those responsible for the Rwandan genocide, 
will end the cycle of violence in the region, pave the way for an 
inclusive democracy in the DROC, and help bring a better life for all 
the people of central Africa.
