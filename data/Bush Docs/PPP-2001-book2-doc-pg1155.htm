Statement on Congressional Action on the United States-Jordan
Free Trade Agreement
September 24, 2001

    I commend the Congress for advancing trade and relations with 
Jordan, a valued friend and partner. The U.S.-Jordan Free Trade 
Agreement will promote peace and security in the region, while creating 
jobs and new investment opportunities in both countries. The agreement 
demonstrates Jordan's strong commitment to economic reform and sends a 
strong signal to Jordan, as well as other countries in the region, that 
support for peace and economic reform yields concrete benefits. I look 
forward to signing this important legislation.

Note: The related proclamation of December 7 to implement the agreement 
is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
