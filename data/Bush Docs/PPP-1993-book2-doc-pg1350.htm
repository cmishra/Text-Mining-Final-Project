Nomination for Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts
August 7, 1993

    The President today announced his nomination of award-winning 
actress, producer, and author Jane Alexander as Chair of the National 
Endowment for the Arts, National Foundation on the Arts and the 
Humanities.
    ``The arts play an essential role in educating and enriching the 
lives of all Americans, and the National Endowment is integral to 
helping arts thrive throughout the country. The NEA helps enhance our 
children's learning, serves as an economic catalyst for local 
communities, and makes the arts a more accessible and vital part of 
people's everyday lives,'' said the President.
    ``The Endowment's mission of fostering and preserving our Nation's 
cultural heritage is too important to remain mired in the problems of 
the past. It is time to move forward, and Jane Alexander is superbly 
qualified to lead the Endowment into a new era of excellence. Just as 
she has brought the power of performance to regional theaters throughout 
the country, she will be a tireless and articulate spokesperson for the 
value of bringing art into the lives of all Americans.
    ``More than 30 years ago, President John F. Kennedy said, `I see 
little of more importance to the future of our country and our 
civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist.' With 
those words as her challenge, I am confident Jane Alexander will work 
tirelessly and courageously to make the arts a full and productive 
partner in our Nation's future,'' the President said.

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
