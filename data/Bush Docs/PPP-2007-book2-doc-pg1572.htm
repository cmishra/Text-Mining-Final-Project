Remarks Following a Visit With Wounded Troops and Their Families at the 
National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland
December 19, 2007

    The President. Admiral,<Jeffries, Richard R.<ls-thn-eq> thank you 
very much for your hospitality. You know, it's a great honor to come 
here. It's an honor to see the troops who've been wounded, and it's an 
honor to hug their families, and it's an honor to see the fabulous care 
that these folks receive. You know, our citizens wonder whether or not 
troops in harm's way will get superb medical care. And the answer is, 
absolutely, they get fantastic medical care.
    Sometimes there's bureaucratic snafus that we're straightening out. 
But our citizens should never question whether or not the nurses and 
docs and caregivers are giving it their all in a professional way. 
They're saving lives, and they're healing hearts at the same time. And 
so it's a wonder what takes place here, admiral.<Jeffries, Richard 
R.<ls-thn-eq> And I want to thank you and the colonel<Moores, Leon 
E.<ls-thn-eq> for taking the lead. And you know, I'm--I know Americans 
join me in praising our troops and honoring their families.
    Merry Christmas to you.
    Rear Adm. Richard R. Jeffries.<Jeffries, Richard R.<ls-thn-eq> Thank 
you, sir. It's an honor to serve them and you.
    The President. Yes, sir. Thank you all. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 2:14 p.m. Participating in the visit were 
Rear Adm. Richard R. Jeffries, USN, commander, and Col. Leon E. Moores, 
USA, deputy commander for integration, National Naval Medical Center.
