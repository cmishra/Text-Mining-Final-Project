    President Bush. Mr. President, thank you.

You've been a very strong and courageous leader, and you have been a 
friend. And I know this is an issue of concern to you because you care 
deeply about the people of your country. And so when you get back home, 
you can tell the people that TPS has been extended.
    Thank you, sir.
    President Saca. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President, 
for extending for 18 months more the TPS for the people of El Salvador. 
This is going to benefit our Salvadoran people with--since we have been
