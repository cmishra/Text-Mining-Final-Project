Statement on Signing the Agriculture Export Relief Act of 1998
July 15, 1998

    Late last night, I was pleased to sign into law a bill that exempts 
agriculture credits from the nuclear sanctions imposed on Pakistan and 
India.
    We need to make sure that our sanctions policy furthers our foreign 
policy goals without imposing undue burdens on our farmers. That's why I 
supported this legislation to ensure that U.S. wheat and other farm 
products will not be the unintended victims of an important 
nonproliferation law. When implementing sanctions, we must never forget 
their humanitarian impact.

    This action allows us to send a strong message abroad without 
ignoring the real needs of those here at home. After Congress phased out 
Federal farm supports, it became more essential for American farmers to 
sell their grains, meats, fruits, and vegetables to markets around the 
world. And today, products from one of every three acres planted in 
America are sold abroad. Whenever we can, we should look for ways to 
expand our agricultural exports, not restrict them.

Note: S. 2282, approved July 14, was assigned Public Law No. 105-194.
