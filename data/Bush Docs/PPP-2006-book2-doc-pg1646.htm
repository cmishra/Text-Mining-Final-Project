Statement on the Death of Ann Richards<Richards, Ann<ls-thn-eq>
September 14, 2006

     Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the 
passing of Governor Ann Richards of Texas. Ann loved Texas, and Texans 
loved her. As a public servant, she earned respect and admiration. Ann 
became a national role model, and her charm, wit, and candor brought a 
refreshing vitality to public life. We extend our sympathies to Ann's 
family and friends. Texas has lost one of its great daughters.
