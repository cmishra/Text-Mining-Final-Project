Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on Federal Funds for Educational 
Programs
June 23, 1997

    I am pleased with the Supreme Court's decision today which will 
raise educational standards for children across America. For the last 10 
years, school districts have been barred from providing title I 
supplemental remedial educational programs to parochial school students 
in their classrooms. These special programs, which supplement the 
school's base curriculum, provide remedial education to students who 
need more than the standard school day provides.
    My administration sought to overturn this unfair restriction. The 
Court's decision explicitly accepts the position put forth by Solicitor 
General Walter Dellinger, representing Secretary of Education Richard 
Riley, that federally funded supplemental education programs may be 
provided to students of both public and parochial schools without 
running afoul of the principle of separation of church and state. No 
longer will children have to leave their school buildings in order to 
get the assistance they need.
    Because of today's ruling, all schoolchildren, whether in public or 
private schools, can benefit equally from the important supplemental 
remedial programs of title I.
