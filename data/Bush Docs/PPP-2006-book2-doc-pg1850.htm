Remarks Following a Meeting With the President's Management Council
October 13, 2006

    It's been my pleasure to meet with members of my administration on a 
very important topic, and that is, how do we make sure that the 
taxpayers' money we're spending is getting the results we want. And I 
appreciate Clay Johnson<Johnson, Clay, III<ls-thn-eq> of the OMB staff. 
And I appreciate the Director<Portman, Robert Jones<ls-thn-eq> for 
spearheading this project, which says to our agencies, it's important to 
set clear goals and to set priorities for the dollars we spend. And once 
a goal is set, a goal that everybody can understand, it's important to 
make sure we measure to determine whether or not we're achieving the 
results.
    See, the people expect--when they send their money up there--expect 
us to achieve certain results. And so we've been through a rigorous 
process in this administration of judging agencies' ability to get 
results, and I will tell you our agencies are responding well. It's 
important to measure results so that we know we're doing our job. It's 
also important to measure results to determine whether or not the 
taxpayers' money is being spent wisely.
    We've all dedicated ourselves to rallying around this model. We are 
results-oriented people, and we work on behalf of the taxpayers. And 
when we find wasteful spending, we work to eliminate it. When we find a 
program that is making a significant difference, we work to enhance it. 
And we are getting results for the people. And I want to thank everybody 
around this table for being public servants, people who are willing to 
serve the public and bring dignity to the process.
    I want you to go back to your agencies and thank those who are 
working hard on behalf of the American people as well. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 2 p.m. in Room 350 of the Dwight D. 
Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
