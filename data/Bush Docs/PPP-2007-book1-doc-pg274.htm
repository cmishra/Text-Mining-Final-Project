Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Proposed Budget Cancellations
March 9, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 request to 
cancel $3.1 billion of funding from lower-priority Federal programs and 
excess funds. This request would offset fully the funds needed to 
address the $3.1 billion FY 2007 funding shortfall for the Department of 
Defense to implement the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment 
and Closure Commission. The proposed cancellations would affect the 
Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and 
Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, and 
Transportation, as well as the Corps of Engineers.
    The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
March 10.
