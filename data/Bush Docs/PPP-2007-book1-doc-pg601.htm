Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency 
Protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and Certain Other Property in 
Which Iraq Has an Interest
May 18, 2007

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication. This notice 
states that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 of 
May 22, 2003, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps 
taken in Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, Executive Order 13350 
of July 29, 2004, and Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, is to 
continue in effect beyond May 22, 2007.
    The threats of attachment or other judicial process against (i) the 
Development Fund for Iraq, (ii) Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, 
and interests therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial 
instruments of any nature whatsoever arising from or related to the sale 
or marketing thereof, and interests therein, or (iii) any accounts, 
assets, investments, or any other property of any kind owned by, 
belonging to, or held by, on behalf of, or otherwise for the Central 
Bank of Iraq obstruct the orderly reconstruction of Iraq. These threats 
also impede the restoration and maintenance of peace and security and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq. These threats continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 
Accordingly, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the 
national emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq, certain 
other property in which Iraq has an interest, and the Central Bank of 
Iraq and maintain in force the measures to respond to this threat.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 May 18, 2007.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
May 21. The related notice of May 18 is listed in Appendix D at the end 
of this volume.
