The President's Radio Address
November 11, 2006

    Good morning. This weekend, we commemorate Veterans Day, a day when 
America honors every man and woman who has worn the uniform of our 
military. In Veterans Day celebrations across our Nation, we remember 
those who have served in previous wars, those who are serving today, and 
those who did not live to become veterans. Especially in a time of war, 
we see in our veterans an example of people who stepped forward to serve 
a cause larger than themselves. This weekend, I ask you to take a moment 
to thank our veterans for their service and express your appreciation 
for the sacrifices they have made to preserve our freedom and way of 
life.
    One freedom that defines our way of life is the freedom to choose 
our leaders at the ballot box. We saw that freedom earlier this week, 
when millions of Americans went to the polls to cast their votes for a 
new Congress. Whatever your opinion of the outcome, all Americans can 
take pride in the example our democracy sets for the world by holding 
elections even in a time of war. Our democratic institutions are a 
source of strength, and our trust in these institutions has made America 
the most powerful, prosperous, and stable nation in the world.
    As a result of this week's elections, the Democrats now hold a 
majority in both Houses of Congress. After the elections, I called the 
Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate to congratulate them on 
the victory they achieved for their party. On Thursday, I had lunch with 
Congresswoman Pelosi<Pelosi, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> and Congressman 
Hoyer,<Hoyer, Steny H.<ls-thn-eq> and on Friday, I met with Senators 
Reid<Reid, Harry<ls-thn-eq> and Durbin.<Durbin, Richard J.<ls-thn-eq> We 
had good discussions. I told them what I have told the men and women in 
my administration: We must put these elections behind us and work 
together on the great issues facing America.
    The elections will bring changes to Washington. But one thing has

changed: America faces brutal enemies who have attacked us before and 
want to attack us again. I have a message for these enemies: Do not 
confuse the workings of American democracy with a lack of American will. 
Our Nation is committed to bringing you to justice, and we will prevail.
    Iraq is the central front in this war on terror. I look forward to 
listening to ideas from the new leaders of Congress on the best way to 
support our troops on the frontlines and win the war on terror. I also 
look forward to hearing recommendations on the way forward in Iraq from 
a bipartisan panel led by former Secretary of State James Baker<Baker, 
James A., III<ls-thn-eq> and former Congressman Lee Hamilton.<Hamilton, 
Lee H.<ls-thn-eq> In the meantime, I have made an important change to my 
national security team. On Wednesday, I accepted Don 
Rumsfeld's<Rumsfeld, Donald H.<ls-thn-eq> resignation as Secretary of 
Defense and announced my intent to nominate Bob Gates<Gates, Robert 
M.<ls-thn-eq> to replace him. Bob is a proven leader who has served six 
Presidents, four Republicans and two Democrats. As a former CIA Director 
and the current president of Texas A&M University, he has experience 
leading large and complex organizations, and he has shown that he is an 
agent of change. As Secretary of Defense, he will provide a fresh 
outlook on our strategy in Iraq and what we need to do to prevail.
    Bob<Gates, Robert M.<ls-thn-eq> replaces the longest serving member 
of my Cabinet, Don Rumsfeld.<Rumsfeld, Donald H.<ls-thn-eq> History will 
record that on Secretary Rumsfeld's watch, the men and women of our 
military overthrew two terrorist regimes, brought justice to scores of 
senior Al Qaida operatives, and helped stop new terrorist attacks on our 
people. America is safer and the world is more secure because of the 
leadership of Don Rumsfeld, and I am deeply grateful for his service.
    The message of this week's elections is clear: The American people 
want their leaders in Washington to set aside partisan differences, 
conduct ourselves in an ethical manner, and work together to address the 
challenges facing our Nation. This is important work that will demand 
the hard effort and good faith of leaders from both sides of the aisle, 
and I pledge to do my part.
    Thank you for listening.
