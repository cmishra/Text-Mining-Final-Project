Statement on Bipartisan Tobacco Legislation
May 14, 1998

    I want to commend Representatives Hansen,<Hansen, James 
V.<ls-thn-eq> Meehan,<Meehan, Martin T.<ls-thn-eq> and Waxman<Waxman, 
Henry A.<ls-thn-eq> for the strong bipartisan support they have 
marshaled for the legislation they are introducing today to reduce youth 
smoking in this country. The Hansen-Meehan-Waxman bill contains tough 
company penalties for failure to reduce youth smoking, full FDA 
authority to regulate tobacco, strong restrictions on advertising and 
youth marketing of tobacco products, and key protections against 
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. With the introduction of this 
important bipartisan bill, the House of Representatives can follow the 
lead of the Senate and finally get down to the serious business of 
reducing youth smoking in this country. I look forward to working with 
Representatives Hansen, Meehan, Waxman, and all of their House 
colleagues to pass a comprehensive tobacco bill this year that includes 
effective measures to reduce youth smoking and that protects farmers and 
farming communities.
