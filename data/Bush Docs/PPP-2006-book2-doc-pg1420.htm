Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments for the Department of Health and Human Services
July 18, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 Budget 
amendments for the Department of Health and Human Services to enhance 
the preparedness and response capabilities of the agency based primarily 
on the findings of the Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina: Lessons 
Learned report of February 2006. The total discretionary budget 
authority in my FY 2007 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
    The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
