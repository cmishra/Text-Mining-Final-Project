Remarks Following a Visit to Washington Hospital Center
September 13, 2001

    We have just seen some really brave men and women. We met with the 
people who work for our Government, that work inside the building. We 
met with their families.
    This is a great hospital. The doctors and nurses are not only 
accomplished, they're loving people. There's a wonderful spirit up on 
the floor that we went to. We told them that our country is praying for 
each and every one there, praying for their families.
    Some of the folks could talk, and they described the horror of the 
incident, the moment. They talked about escaping, going through fire, 
crawling through debris. It was clear that they were fighting for their 
survival then, and like every patient up there, they're still fighting 
for survival.
    And it was just a sobering moment for Laura and me. But we again 
thank the hospital, the docs, the nurses and, of course, again tell the 
families that the Nation prays for those who have been injured by this 
unbelievable act of terror.
    Thank you all.
      

Note: The President spoke at 12:20 p.m. outside the main entrance to 
Washington
