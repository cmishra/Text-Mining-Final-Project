Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: It's my pleasure to welcome you to 
New York. We look forward to concluding a successful 62d session of the

    Mr. Secretary-General, I appreciate your determination to ensure 
that the United Nations lives up to its high ideals, takes 
responsibilities seriously, and helps more people live in freedom and 
justice. You have urged this organization to help the suffering people 
of Darfur. You have strengthened international resolve to deter regimes 
pursuing the world's most dangerous weapons. You have supported freedom 
and independence for the people of Lebanon and Afghanistan and Iraq.
    Under your leadership, the United Nations is addressing global 
challenges, such as the important issue of climate change. I welcome 
your efforts to advance the work of U.N. reform and uphold the highest 
ethical standards throughout this organization.
    So, Mr. Secretary-General, in honor of your first year of leadership 
and in anticipation of your continued leadership in the years to come, I 
offer a toast to you and to the United Nations.

Note: The President spoke at 8:44 p.m. at the United Nations 
Headquarters. In his remarks, he referred to Srgjan Kerim, President, 
62d Session of the U.N. General Assembly. The transcript released by the 
Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of Secretary-
