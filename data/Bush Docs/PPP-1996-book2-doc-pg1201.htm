Statement on Senate Action on Health Care and Minimum Wage Legislation
July 25, 1996

    I am pleased that the Senate has broken the gridlock and appointed 
conferees to deal with two of my highest priorities to help working 
families: health care and the minimum wage. I commend the leadership of 
both parties who have diligently worked to reach this point.
    The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill will allow American workers the security 
of knowing that they will not lose their health coverage if they change 
their jobs. We now have the opportunity to move forward and enact real 
health insurance reform this year.
    Raising the minimum wage for millions of America's hardest workers 
is also the right thing to do. Working parents simply cannot support a 
family on $4.25 an hour.
    I urge the conferees to take swift action on these two important 
measures before the August recess. America's working families deserve 
nothing less.
