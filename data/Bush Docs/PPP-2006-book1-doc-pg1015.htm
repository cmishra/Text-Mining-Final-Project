Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Energy Legislation
May 25, 2006

    I applaud the House of Representatives for passing the energy and 
water appropriations bill. I am grateful for the House leadership's work 
on it. This bill marks a critical first step toward realizing my 
American Competitiveness Initiative, and it fully funds my request for 
the Energy Department's Office of Science. I appreciate the leadership 
of Chairman Hobson<Hobson, David L.<ls-thn-eq> and Chair-man 
Lewis<Lewis, Charles J. ``Jerry''<ls-thn-eq> in working to keep our 
economy the most competitive in the world. This bill also will support 
my Advanced Energy Initiative and help make America more secure and less 
dependent on foreign sources of energy. I urge the Senate to join the 
House in supporting these important initiatives.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 5427.
