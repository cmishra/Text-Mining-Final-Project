Statement on the Terrorist Bombings in Amman, Jordan
November 9, 2005

    Today's terrorist bombings in Amman were cowardly attacks on 
innocent Jordanians and their guests. These barbaric acts again 
demonstrated the terrible cruelty of the terrorists and the great toll 
they take on civilized society. I send my prayers and condolences and 
those of the American people to the families of all those killed in 
these attacks and to those who were wounded. To the people of Jordan and 
King Abdullah,<King Abdullah II<ls-thn-eq> we pledge our full support in 
their efforts to bring the terrorists to justice. Jordan is a key ally 
in the war on terror and will have all assistance we can offer.
