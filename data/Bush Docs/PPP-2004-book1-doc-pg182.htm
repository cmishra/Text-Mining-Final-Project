Statement on the Decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on 
Same-Sex Marriage
February 4, 2004

    Today's ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is deeply 
troubling. Marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman. 
If activist judges insist on redefining marriage by court order, the 
only alternative will be the constitutional process. We must do what is 
legally necessary to defend the sanctity of marriage.
