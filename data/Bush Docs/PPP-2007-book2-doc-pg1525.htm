Remarks on Arrival in Omaha, Nebraska
December 5, 2007

    The President. Good morning. I'm pleased to be back in Nebraska.
    Senatorial candidate Michael O. Johanns. Welcome back.
    The President. I do want to say a couple of words about Iran before 
I talk about my friend Mike Johanns.<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq>
    On the way out here, I spoke with my team, who gave me a report on 
conversations that the Secretary of State<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> 
and our National Security Adviser<Hadley, Stephen J.<ls-thn-eq> have had 
over the last couple of days with their counterparts in the United 
Kingdom, in Germany and France and Russia. These countries understand 
that the Iranian nuclear issue is a problem and continues to be a 
problem that must be addressed by the international community. A number 
of them have said so publicly, and I appreciate their comments.
    I appreciate the work of our intelligence community in helping us 
better understand Iran's past and present nuclear activities. Their 
information is critical in increasing our understanding and helping us 
develop a sound policy.
    It is clear from the latest NIE that the Iranian Government has more 
to explain about its nuclear intentions and past actions, especially the 
covert nuclear weapons program pursued until the fall of 2003, which the 
Iranian regime has yet to acknowledge. The Iranians have a strategic 
choice to make. They can come clean with the international community 
about the scope of their nuclear activities and fully accept the 
longstanding offer to suspend their enrichment program and come to the 
table and negotiate, or they can continue on a path of isolation that is 
not in the best interest of the Iranian people. The choice is up to the 
Iranian regime.
    I'm here also to talk about my friend Mike Johanns.<Johanns, 
Mike<ls-thn-eq> I have gotten to know him well, and there's no doubt in 
my mind he'll make a great United States Senator from the State of 
Nebraska. He's an honorable, decent man, and he's a humble man. When 
given a task, he can get the job done.
    People of Nebraska have gotten to know Mike<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> 
as a result of his leadership when he was the Governor. I got to know 
Mike as the result of his being a fine leader at the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. Mike understands farming, and he understands ranching. He 
understands the issues that the people who work the soil will face. If I 
were someone living in Nebraska who cared about the agricultural 
industry, I'd want somebody who knew what he was talking about being my 
Senator. And Mike Johanns knows what he's talking about when it comes to 
agricultural matters.
    He<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> also understands what he's talking about 
when it comes to national security matters. He sat in the Cabinet Room 
with me and other members of my Cabinet, discussing how best to secure 
the United

States of America from the threats of the world in which we live. It is 
important for the people of Nebraska to have a Senator who understands 
the realities of the world and is willing to support the Government in 
its efforts to protect the American people.
    Mike Johanns<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> is a man of values. He 
understands Nebraskan values. He can articulate Nebraskan values, but 
more importantly, he lives Nebraskan values.
    And so I've come to say to the people of this good State: I know 
you're going to make up your own mind for what's right, but if I was a 
voter in this State, I'd sure pull that lever for Mike Johanns<Johanns, 
Mike<ls-thn-eq> for the United States Senator. [Laughter] And if my 
wife<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> was a voter for this State--[laughter]--
she'd try to pull it twice. [Laughter]
    So I'm proud to be here with Mike<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> and 
Stephanie.<Johanns, Stephanie<ls-thn-eq> Thank you, sir. Good luck, and 
God bless you. Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 9:01 a.m. at Eppley Airfield. In his 
remarks, he referred to Stephanie Johanns, wife of Nebraska senatorial 
candidate Michael O. Johanns.
