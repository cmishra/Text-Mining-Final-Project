Message on the Observance of Indian Independence Day, 1995
August 15, 1995

    Greetings to all those celebrating Indian Independence Day.
    Our two nations share a commitment to democracy and a reverence for 
freedom that has nurtured our warm friendship. India's ongoing economic 
transformation offers the people of India great hope for fulfilling 
their aspirations, and we stand beside them. The United States looks 
forward to realizing a full range of new personal, political, and 
economic ties with India in the future.
    Please accept my best wishes for a joyous celebration and for peace, 
prosperity, and the continued blessings of liberty in the future.

                                                            Bill Clinton
