Statement on Senator Don Nickles'<Nickles, Don<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not 
To Seek Reelection
October 7, 2003

    For more than two decades, Don Nickles has served the people of 
Oklahoma and America as a distinguished United States Senator. As a 
longtime member of the Senate leadership and most recently as chairman 
of the Senate Budget Committee, he has led efforts to keep Government 
spending in check and to keep more money in the pockets of American 
taxpayers. He has left his mark on virtually every major issue that has 
moved through the Senate. Senator Nickles is a friend and trusted 
adviser, and I look forward to working with him for the remainder of his 
time in the Senate and in the future.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I extend our thanks and best wishes 
to Don, Linda,<Nickles, Linda<ls-thn-eq> and their four children, 
Don,<Nickles, Don, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Jenny,<Nickles, Jenny<ls-thn-eq> 
Kim,<Nickles, Kim<ls-thn-eq> and Robyn,<Nickles, Robyn<ls-thn-eq> for 
their commitment to public service, and we wish them all the best.
