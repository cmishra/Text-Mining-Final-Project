Statement on the Decision of Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 
II<Kennedy, Joseph P., II<ls-thn-eq>
Not To Seek Reelection
March 13, 1998

    For 12 years in the United States House of Representatives, Joe 
Kennedy has proven himself to be a dedicated advocate for the Nation's 
working families. His efforts on behalf of his Massachusetts 
constituents, as well as underprivileged people across America, will be 
sorely missed in Washington. As one of the foremost voices in the 
Congress for low income housing opportunities for needy families, 
Representative Kennedy worked to expand the availability of credit to 
working Americans to buy homes and to open businesses.
    I know that Representative Kennedy will continue his family's long 
tradition of public service on behalf of our Nation. I wish him well in 
all of his future endeavors, and on behalf of the Nation I thank him for 
his dedicated service.
