Remarks on Presenting the Arts and Humanities Awards
April 22, 2002

    The President. Please be seated. We meet this evening to recognize 
some of our Nation's finest artists and scholars and authors. We honor 
their lifelong pursuit of excellence, and we hold up their achievements 
to future generations.
    I want to welcome you all. I want to thank Dr. Bruce Cole,<Cole, 
Bruce> who is the Chairman of the National Endowment for the 
Humanities, and Eileen Mason,<Mason, Eileen> Acting Chairman 
for the National Endowment for the Arts. I want to recognize Mrs. Lynne 
Cheney;<Cheney, Lynne> Secretary of State Colin Powell<Powell, 
Colin L.> and his wife, Alma;<Powell, Alma> Tom 
Ridge,<Ridge, Tom> who is the Director of the Homeland 
Security Office.
    Tonight we've got members of the Supreme Court with us: Antonin 
Scalia<Scalia, Antonin> and his wife, Maureen;<Scalia, 
Maureen> Stephen Breyer<Breyer, Stephen G.> and his 
wife, Joanna.<Breyer, Joanna> We've got a special 
entertainment tonight provided by my National Security Adviser, 
Condoleezza Rice.<Rice, Condoleezza> [Laughter]
    I want to thank the Members of the United States Congress who are 
here: from the United States Senate, Pete Domenici<Domenici, Pete 
V.> and Joe Lieberman,<Lieberman, Joseph I.> and 
from the House of Representatives, Norman Dicks,<Dicks, Norman 
D.> Mike McNulty,<McNulty, Michael R.> Tom 
Petri,<Petri, Thomas E.> Silvestre Reyes,<Reyes, 
Silvestre> and Louise Slaughter.<Slaughter, Louise 
McIntosh>
    I also want to thank Adair Margo,<Margo, Adair> who is the 
Chairman of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities. I 
want to thank the members of that committee, as well as the members of 
the National Council on the Arts and National Council on the Humanities.
    I also want to pay tribute to the memory of Michael Hammond, who 
passed away in January after serving for only one week as the Chairman 
of the National Endowment for the Arts. A classically educated scholar, 
Mike Hammond was also a composer and an educator and an expert on the 
neurology of the brain. All of us who

were privileged to know Mike will miss him deeply.
    The men and women who are about to receive the National Medal of 
Arts and the National Humanities Medal are singers and dancers and 
painters and producers and actors and writers and scholars. Yet, for all 
their differences, they have one thing in common: They're all teachers. 
They teach us about a ``Boy Named Sue''--[laughter]--about an ``Odd 
Couple.'' They teach us about a ``Last Lion'' or a ``Ragman's Son.'' 
They help us to see more clearly and to think more deeply. They connect 
our past to our present and point the way to our future. And of course, 
they all have ``The Right Stuff.'' [Laughter]
    Honoring our leading artists and writers comes naturally to us. Yet, 
art and literature are often the first targets of tyranny, because 
they're the most prominent features of a free, creative, and open 
society. This creativity, this openness, and this freedom are what 
America defends today.
    This evening, as we celebrate the achievements of these remarkably 
talented women and men, let us also take just a moment to celebrate the 
Nation that esteems their craft, their hard work, and their sacrifice. 
America is proud to stand for creativity and freedom and civilization, 
and we honor these men and women who embody these values for America and 
for the world.
    It is now my privilege to present the 2001 National Humanities Medal
