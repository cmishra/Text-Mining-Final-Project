Statement on Senate Action on Internal Revenue Service Reform 
Legislation
July 9, 1998

    I am pleased that the Senate has finally passed bipartisan 
legislation to reform the IRS and strengthen taxpayer rights. This 
reform will help my effort to create an IRS that respects American 
taxpayers and respects their values. I look forward to signing it into 
law.
