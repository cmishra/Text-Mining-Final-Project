Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Iraq
July 31, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Iraq emergency is to continue in 
effect beyond August 2, 2003, to the Federal Register for publication. 
The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in the 
Federal Register on August 1, 2002, (67 Fed. Reg. 50341).
    The crisis that led to the declaration of a national emergency on 
August 2, 1990, has not been fully resolved. The United States, along 
with its coalition partners, continues to work to stabilize Iraq, 
identify and dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, capture 
former regime leaders, and locate and return Iraqi assets overseas for 
the benefit of the Iraqi people. As part of the Coalition Provisional 
Authority, the United States is providing for the temporary governance 
of Iraq, including the establishment of a process to lead to a new 
internationally recognized government. For these reasons, I have 
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency 
declared with respect to Iraq.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The notice of July 31 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
