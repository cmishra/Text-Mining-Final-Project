Statement on the Death of Representative Paul E. Gillmor<Gillmor, Paul 
E.<ls-thn-eq>
September 6, 2007

    Congressman Paul Gillmor's life was an extraordinary example to 
service and leadership. From working as an Air Force judge advocate 
during the Vietnam war to championing legislation in the Halls of 
Congress, Paul devoted his career to strengthening his State and his 
nation. He was a good man and dedicated public servant who represented 
the people of Ohio with distinction for four decades. In Ohio, he served 
as president of the State senate for three general assemblies. In 
Washington, Paul was well respected for his leadership of a wide range 
of issues before the House Financial Services and Energy and Commerce 
Committees. We will always remain grateful for his service.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by his death. 
We pray for his wife Karen<Gillmor, Karen L.<ls-thn-eq> and their 
family.
