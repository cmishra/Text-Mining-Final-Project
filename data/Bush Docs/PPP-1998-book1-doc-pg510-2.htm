Statement on British and French Ratification of the Comprehensive 
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
April 6, 1998

    Today, France and Great Britain deposited their instruments of 
ratification for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) with 
the Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York, thus becoming 
the first nuclear weapon states to ratify the CTBT.
    I applaud this milestone in the global effort to reduce the nuclear 
threat and build a safer world. In particular, I want to thank Prime 
Minister Blair<Blair, Tony<ls-thn-eq> and President Chirac<Chirac, 
Jacques<ls-thn-eq> and the Parliaments of Great Britain and France for 
their leadership in paving the way towards early entry into force of 
this historic treaty.
    The CTBT has now been signed by 149 states, including all 5 nuclear 
weapon states. In my State of the Union Address, I asked the Senate to 
give its advice and consent to the CTBT this year. The CTBT is in the 
best interests of the United States because its provisions will 
significantly further our nuclear nonproliferation and arms control 
objectives and strengthen international security.
