Statement on the Tragedy in Waco, Texas
April 19, 1993

    I am deeply saddened by the loss of life in Waco today. My thoughts 
and prayers are with the families of David Koresh's victims.
    The law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended 
the course of action pursued today. The Attorney General informed me of 
their analysis and judgment and recommended that we proceed with today's 
action given the risks of maintaining the previous policy indefinitely. 
I told the Attorney General to do what she thought was right, and I 
stand by that decision.
