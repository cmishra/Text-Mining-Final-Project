Statement on the Resignation of Gale Norton<Norton, Gale A.<ls-thn-eq> 
as Secretary of the Interior
March 10, 2006

    Gale Norton has been a strong advocate for the wise use and 
protection of our Nation's natural resources and a valuable member of my 
administration for more than 5 years. As the first woman Secretary of 
the Interior, she served the Nation well with her vision for cooperative 
conservation, protection and improvement of our national parks and 
public lands, and environmentally responsible energy development on 
public lands and waters. She was instrumental in establishing my Healthy 
Forests Initiative that has helped make communities safer from 
catastrophic fire, while improving wildlife habitat. Gale played an 
influential role in shaping the Nation's offshore and onshore energy 
policies to help enhance America's domestic production. When Hurricane 
Katrina devastated the gulf coast region, she played a leading role in 
my administration's efforts to restore badly needed offshore energy 
production to avoid further supply disruption and higher energy costs 
for consumers. Because of her leadership and thoughtful attention to 
management, repairs, and maintenance issues, Americans will be able to 
better enjoy our great national parks and wildlife refuges for 
generations to come. I appreciate Gale's dedicated service to our 
country, and I wish Gale and John<Hughes, John<ls-thn-eq> all the best.
