To the Congress of the United States:
    I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies 
of the Republic of Romania as required by subsections 402(b) and 409(b)

subsections 402(a) and 409(a) of the Act. As required by Title IV, I 
will provide the Congress with periodic reports regarding Romania's 
compliance with these emigration standards.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
