Remarks Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan<Erdogan, Recep Tayyip<ls-thn-eq> of Turkey in Ankara, Turkey
June 27, 2004

    Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. You're right, this is my first trip 
to your beautiful country as President. It also happens to be my first 
trip to your beautiful country ever, and we're honored to be here. We 
appreciate the hospitality of the Turkish people.
    We look forward to meaningful discussions on a variety of subjects, 
bilateral relations, how we can strengthen NATO. I would remind the 
people of this good country that I believe you ought to be given a date 
by the EU for your eventual acceptance into the EU. I also look forward 
to working with you on matters regarding the neighborhood, Iraq and 
elsewhere. I appreciate so very much the example your country has set on 
how to be a Muslim country and, at the same time, a country which 
embraces democracy and rule of law and freedom.
    And so I'm so grateful for your invitation. Thank you very much for 
it, and I look forward to a fruitful discussion with you and with our 
NATO partners.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 9:40 a.m. at the Prime 
Minister's residence. Prior to the President's remarks, Prime Minister 
Erdogan spoke in Turkish, and no translation was provided. A tape was 
not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
