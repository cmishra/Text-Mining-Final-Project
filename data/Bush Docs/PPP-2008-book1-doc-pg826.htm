Remarks to Reporters in Paris, France
June 15, 2008

Midwest Flooding/Father's Day

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I had the joy of worshiping here in 
Paris.
    My thoughts and prayers go out to those who are suffering from the 
floods in our country. I know there's a lot of people hurting right now, 
and I hope they're able to find some strength in knowing that there is 
love from a higher being.
    I also want to wish all the fathers in America happy Father's Day. 
So, Dad,<Bush, George H.W.<ls-thn-eq> if you're listening, happy 
Father's Day.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 12:13 p.m. at the American Cathedral of the 
Holy Trinity.
