Nomination for Three Federal Judges
September 24, 1993

    The President announced the nominations today of three Federal 
judges: Rosemary Barkett for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh 
Circuit, Raymond Jackson for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of Virginia, and Joanna Seybert for the U.S. District Court for 
the Eastern District of New York.
    ``These three individuals have all exhibited the high levels of 
ability and judgment that the American people deserve to expect from 
Federal judges,'' said the President.

the Press Secretary.
