Statement on the Japan-United States Agreement on Interconnection Rates
July 18, 2000

    This important agreement on interconnection rates will help further 
reduce regulatory barriers to trade between the United States and Japan. 
It will level the playing field for America's cutting edge technologies 
and increase the number of Japanese consumers connected to the Internet. 
It's a win-win for the United States and Japan and represents an 
important step as we prepare to discuss the impact of information 
technology on the global economy at the G-7/G-8 summit.
