Statement on House of Representatives Passage of the United States- Oman 
Free Trade Agreement
July 20, 2006

    I am pleased the House has approved our free trade agreement with 
Oman. This agreement will advance America's national security by 
strengthening our bilateral relations with a strategic friend and ally 
in the Middle East region. The agreement will also level the playing 
field for U.S. workers and businesses and will support Oman's leaders as 
they seek to create long-term opportunities for the Omani people. I look 
forward to signing this legislation and to continuing our efforts to 
build a Middle East free trade area.
