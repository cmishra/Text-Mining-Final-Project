Statement on the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak)
April 7, 1995

    The service reductions announced by Amtrak are tough but necessary 
choices in the face of stark fiscal realities and, along with the 
adjustments Amtrak announced last December, represent an urgent attempt 
to move the passenger railroad toward a stable economic future.
    This administration remains committed to the future of rail 
passenger service in this country and has included significant capital 
support for Amtrak in its 1996 budget.
    To address the pressures Amtrak faces and to promote a more 
businesslike approach, the Department of Transportation today 
transmitted to Congress the ``Amtrak Restructuring Act of 1995.''
    I encourage rail labor, Congress, Governors, mayors, and other 
constituents to continue to work closely with Amtrak as it works to 
develop rail passenger service for the 21st century. We look to our 
partners in Congress to support the ``Amtrak Restructuring Act of 1995'' 
and for continued financial support of rail passenger service.
