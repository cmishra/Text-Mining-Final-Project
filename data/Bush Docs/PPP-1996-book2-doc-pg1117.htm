Statement on the Death of John Chancellor
July 13, 1996

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of one of the true 
frontiersmen of television journalism, John Chancellor. John's 
scrupulous attention to the facts and his ability to capture the spirit 
of an issue won him the hearts and minds of the American people. From 
his historic coverage of a story very personal to me, the desegregation 
of Central High School in Little Rock, to his renowned political 
reporting, John brought us the very best journalism had to offer. We 
extend our sincerest prayers and deepest sympathies to his family, his 
friends, and his colleagues at NBC News.
