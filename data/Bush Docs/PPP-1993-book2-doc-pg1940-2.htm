Nomination for the Communications Satellite Corporation
November 9, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Peter S. 
Knight, a former top aide to Vice President Gore, to serve on the Board 
of Directors of the Communications Satellite Corporation.
    ``Peter Knight, through his many years of work for the Vice 
President and his private sector accomplishments, has established 
himself as an expert on communications matters with a solid grasp of 
business management,'' said the President. ``I think he will be an 
outstanding addition to COMSAT's board.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
