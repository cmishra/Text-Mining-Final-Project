Statement on Assistance to Mozambique
March 1, 2000

    This evening I am announcing my intention to augment substantially 
U.S. assistance to flood-ravaged Mozambique, and to ongoing regional 
efforts to address the emergency caused by flooding in southern Africa.
    The United States has already committed $12.8 million from the U.S. 
Agency for International Development and the Department of Defense in 
support of relief activities. This includes over $4 million for search 
and rescue air operations and the deployment of a water rescue team and 
boats from Metro-Dade, Florida. Already, one U.S. military aircraft 
delivered relief supplies to Mozambique today, and a second will shortly 
arrive in South Africa. Our assistance also includes food and funds to 
support efforts to control the spread of disease. Other countries are 
contributing generously as well. But we can do more to address the needs 
of the nearly one million people who have been displaced in the region 
and who face more flooding in the days to come.
    I have approved the deployment of a Joint Task Force to the region 
to assist in the relief effort. The deployment will include six C-130 
support aircraft to deliver relief supplies, six heavy-lift helicopters 
to assist in search and rescue, and small boat search and rescue 
capability. The deployments will help support the relief effort in 
Mozambique and elsewhere in the region.

    All Americans have been deeply moved by the tragic events in 
southern Africa. At the same time, we have admired the determination of 
the governments and people of the region to meet this challenge. We have 
also been gratified by the generous response of the American people and 
others in the international community.
    I offer the strong support of the Government and the people of the 
United States to the people of Mozambique, and all of southern Africa, 
and pledge that we will work with you to address this crisis.

Note: The related memorandum of March 2 on emergency disaster assistance 
for southern Africa is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
