Message to the Congress on Certification of Satellite Fuels and 
Separation Systems Exports to China
May 10, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of Public Law 105-
261, the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1999, I hereby certify that the export to the People's Republic of 
China of satellite fuels and separation systems for the U.S.-origin 
Iridium commercial communications satellite program:
       (1)  is not detrimental to the United States space launch 
            industry; and
       (2)  the material and equipment, including any indirect technical 
            benefit that could be derived from such export, will not 
            measurably improve the missile or space launch capabilities 
            of the People's Republic of China.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

May 10, 1999.
