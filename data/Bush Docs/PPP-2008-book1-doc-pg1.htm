Remarks on Departure From Waco, Texas
January 1, 2008

    The President. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish our fellow 
Americans a happy and healthy 2008. I particularly want to say something 
to our troops and their families: This country respects you, we admire 
you, and we wish you a great 2008 as well.
    We've just come off the ranch; had a good rest and good New Year's 
with some friends. And I'm looking forward to getting back to Washington 
to work on policies to keep this country safe and to keep this country 
prosperous.
    I just wanted to stop by and wish everybody a happy 2008. Thank you.
    The First Lady.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> Happy New Year, everybody.

Note: The President spoke at 10:35 a.m. at Texas State Technical 
College. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
these remarks.
