Remarks to Citizens in Brussels
January 9, 1994

    Thank you all for coming out tonight. Thank you for waving the 
flags. I'm sorry we didn't have more room inside, but I'm glad we could 
show the speech on the screen.
    Let me say that I have been in this place many times. I've been here 
as a student. I've been here as the Governor of my State. I never 
imagined I would actually be here as President and you would be here to 
say hello. You have already heard my speech; I have really nothing else 
to say except I'm delighted to be here. We are here to build a new and 
stronger future for Europe and a better partnership between Europe and 
the United States, and I hope all of you will support that.
    Happy New Year, and thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 6:47 p.m. in the Grand Place, upon his 
departure from the Hotel de Ville.
