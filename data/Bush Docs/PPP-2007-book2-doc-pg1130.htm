Remarks Following a Visit With New Homeowners in New Orleans
August 29, 2007

    The President. We have just--Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I have 
just been given a tour by the Whites<White, Gen<ls-thn-eq> in their new 
home. And they're going to be moving into this home this weekend maybe.
    Gen White.<White, Gen<ls-thn-eq> Yes, this weekend.
    The President. There's nothing more hopeful than to be with somebody 
who says, ``Welcome to my home,'' particularly given the fact that these 
mixed-use housing projects have replaced old-style, low-income housing 
projects that frankly didn't work. In other words, the storm came, 
created a lot of heartbreak and heartache, but people took a different 
look at how best to help people in their homes.
    And we're in this beautiful project. This is a stunning project. So 
I'm with homeowners-to-be, renters. Here's a homeowner-to-be right here. 
Right across the street, as a matter of fact, isn't that right? People 
are going to be able to say, ``This is my home.''
    This is really a remarkable project. For people in New Orleans who 
remember what this site was like compared to what it is today, they've 
got to be full of hope. And so I appreciate the builders. I appreciate 
Alphonso Jackson<Jackson, Alphonso R.<ls-thn-eq> in Housing and Urban 
Development, the group that have helped get this project started. But 
most of all, I appreciate the homeowners-to-be, people who are working 
hard to be able to say, ``This is my home.'' And we really appreciate 
you giving us a chance to come by.
    Ms. White.<White, Gen<ls-thn-eq> Thank you.
    The President. And we wish you all the very best in your new home. 
Congratulations to you.
    Thank you all. Good job. Thank you. Good luck to you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:06 a.m. at the River Garden Housing 
Complex.
