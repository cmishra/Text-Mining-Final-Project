Nomination for Posts at the Energy and Interior Departments and the     
Office of Personnel Management
April 6, 1993

    The President today named three deputies to the Departments of 
Energy and the Interior and the Office of Personnel Management. The 
President announced his intention to nominate William H. White as Deputy 
Secretary at the Department of Energy and Lorraine A. Green as Deputy 
Director of the Office of Personnel Management. In addition, the 
President approved Allen P. Stayman as Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Territorial and International Affairs at the Department of the Interior.
    ``The field experience, technical know-how, and commitment to 
excellence these three individuals have demonstrated in the past will 
serve them well as they join our teams already in place at Energy, OPM, 
and Interior,'' the President said. ``I have full confidence they will 
work hard to reinvent the way Government works.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
