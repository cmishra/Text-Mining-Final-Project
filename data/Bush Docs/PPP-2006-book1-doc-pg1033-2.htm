Joint Statement by President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony 
Blair<Blair, Tony<ls-thn-eq> of the United Kingdom
May 26, 2006

    The United States has no closer ally than the United Kingdom. U.S. 
and U.K. forces are fighting terror in Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the 
globe. The Prime Minister and the President discussed ways to strengthen 
defense cooperation.
    The two leaders are pleased to announce that the United States and 
United Kingdom recently signed an agreement that allows appropriately 
cleared British and U.S. personnel to use the same computer network to 
access military and intelligence information and other planning tools to 
support joint military operations in the defense of freedom.
    Additionally, the leaders recognize that as American and British 
soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are right now standing together 
in harm's way, we must plan for the future capabilities that will 
enhance our ability to cooperate. Both governments agree that the UK 
will have the ability to successfully operate, upgrade, employ, and 
maintain the Joint Strike Fighter such that the UK retains operational 
sovereignty over the aircraft. Further, both governments agree to 
protect sensitive technologies found within the Joint Strike Fighter 
program. Together, we are working out the details, while remaining 
committed to these principles.
    Finally, the President and Prime Minister have a shared view that we 
need to continue to strengthen and deepen the relationship between our 
defense establishments to achieve fully interoperable forces and to 
leverage the respective strengths of U.S. and U.K. industries. The Prime 
Minister and President look forward to new ways we can achieve that 
goal.
