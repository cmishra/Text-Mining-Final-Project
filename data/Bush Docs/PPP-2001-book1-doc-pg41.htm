Remarks Prior to a Meeting With the Congressional Black Caucus
January 31, 2001

    The President. I want to thank Congresswoman Eddie Bernice 
Johnson<Johnson, Eddie Bernice<ls-thn-eq> from Dallas, Texas, and you 
all for coming. I appreciate--Madam Chairman. I look forward to a good 
dialog on subjects that are on the Members' minds and on my mind, as 
well.
    I think we'll have a good discussion about public education. While 
there may be some discussion about details, all of us surely believe the 
great hope for this country is to make sure every child--I mean every 
child--is educated. I look forward to sharing with the Members who don't 
know me well some of my experiences as the Governor of the State of 
Texas and what I've tried to do to fulfill that promise and fulfill that 
pledge.
    This will be the beginning of, hopefully, a lot of meetings. I hope 
you come back, and I'll certainly be inviting. But thanks for coming. 
It's an important part of my job--is to talk to everybody who is in the 
legislative body. I will remind you all, I understand the difference 
between the executive branch and the legislative branch. I only get to 
suggest. You all pass the laws. And that's what we're here to work----
    Representative Cynthia A. McKinney.<McKinney, Cynthia A.<ls-thn-eq> 
That's right. [Laughter]
    The President. I understand that well. But thank you all for coming. 
It's an honor for you to be here.

Note: The President spoke at 5:32 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
