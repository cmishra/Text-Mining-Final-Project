Statement on Unfunded Federal Mandates Reform Legislation
October 4, 1994

    I want to state today my continued support for efforts by Congress 
to restore balance to the intergovernmental partnership between the 
Federal Government and State, local, and tribal governments. Since my 
days as Governor of Arkansas, I have spoken out on the need to address 
the burgeoning growth of Federal unfunded mandates. As President, I have 
taken action to resolve this problem within the executive branch by 
issuing Executive Order 12875, ``Enhancing the Intergovernmental 
Partnership.''
    However, more needs to be done. Therefore, I want to reiterate my 
endorsement of and strongly encourage the Congress to send to my desk 
before the session ends, the bipartisan ``Federal Mandate Accountability 
and Reform Act of 1994.'' This legislation, drafted by Senator Glenn and 
Senator Kempthorne in close consultation with my administration, will 
curtail the imposition of Federal mandates on State, local, and tribal 
governments without adequate Federal funding and will promote informed 
and deliberate decisions by Congress on the appropriateness of Federal 
requirements in any particular instances.
