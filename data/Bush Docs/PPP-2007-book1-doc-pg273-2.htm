Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Request for Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Supplemental Budget 
Revisions
March 9, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed revisions to the FY 2007 
Department of Defense supplemental request proposed in my FY 2008 
Budget. This revised request would better align resources based on the 
assessment of military commanders to achieve the goal of establishing 
Iraq and Afghanistan as democratic and secure nations that are free of 
terrorism. Overall, the discretionary budget authority in my FY 2007 
supplemental proposal would not be increased by these requests.
    The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
March 10.
