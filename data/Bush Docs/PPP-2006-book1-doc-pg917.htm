Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Tax Legislation
May 10, 2006

    The tax cuts we passed in recent years are working to fuel America's 
economic expansion. Our progrowth policies have helped the economy 
create more than 5.2 million jobs since August of 2003, and last year, 
our economy grew faster than that of any other major industrialized 
nation. By extending key Capital Gains and Dividends tax relief, the 
House has taken an important step to continue to help hard-working 
Americans and to keep our economy strong and growing. I appreciate the 
House Leadership and Chairman Bill Thomas<Thomas, William M.<ls-thn-eq> 
for their hard work.
    I urge the Senate to vote swiftly so that I can sign this bill into 
law and put a stop to a massive tax hike that would be disastrous for 
small businesses, our economy, and all working Americans.
