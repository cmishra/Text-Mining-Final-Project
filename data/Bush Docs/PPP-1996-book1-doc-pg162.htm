Remarks in Manchester, New Hampshire, on the Death of an
American Soldier in Bosnia
February 3, 1996

    I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of an American soldier 
this morning in Bosnia. This is the first fatality suffered by American 
service personnel in Operation Joint Endeavor. Hillary and I join all 
Americans in extending our deepest sympathies to his family and his 
friends. Our prayers are with you this afternoon and so is the pride of 
the Nation, for he gave his life in the noblest of causes, the search 
for peace.
    I have been clear since before this operation began that our mission 
to secure peace in Bosnia would entail some risks. We have done 
everything we could to minimize those risks, and all Americans should 
know that we have provided our troops with the best training, the best 
equipment, to confront the challenges they face in Bosnia, and they are 
very well-led in a careful implementation of their mission. We will 
continue to take every precaution we can to protect our troops as they 
work to secure an enduring peace in Bosnia. And all of our troops should 
know that today our thoughts and our sincere gratitude are with them, 
especially on this difficult day.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 3:30 p.m. at the Manchester airport. In his 
remarks, he referred to Sfc. Donald A. Dugan, USA.
