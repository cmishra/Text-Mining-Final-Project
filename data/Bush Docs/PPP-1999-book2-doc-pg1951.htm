November 2, 1999

Middle East Peace Process

    The President. I think I can speak for all of us when I say, first, 
we're very grateful to the Government of Norway for inviting us here for 
this important ceremony. And we now have to give some real energy to the 
framework talks, but I think even though the issues are difficult, the 
will is strong, and we're off to a good start.
    Q. How do you see the strong focus, Mr. President, on the issue of 
the settlement?
    The President. I think that the less we say now to the public and 
the more we work in private, the better off we'll be and the more likely 
we will be able to get an agreement.
    Q. [Inaudible]--a summit in January or February in Washington, or 
maybe in Camp David?
    The President. I wouldn't--I don't think we should rule it out or 
in. We ought to make sure--see how much progress we can make between now 
and then. You know, I would do anything I could to help them.
    Q. What is the main issue you will discuss right now when you start 
negotiations?
    The President. I think we just have to talk about--to get agreement 
on the ground rules, how we're going to proceed.

Note: The President spoke at 5:45 p.m. in the U.S. Ambassador's 
residence. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
these remarks.
