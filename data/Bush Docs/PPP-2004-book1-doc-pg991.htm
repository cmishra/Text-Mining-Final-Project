Remarks on Presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Pope John 
Paul II<Pope John Paul II<ls-thn-eq> at the Vatican City State
June 4, 2004

    The President. Your Holiness, thank you very much for receiving 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and me and our delegation. I bring 
greetings from our country, where you are respected, admired, and 
greatly loved.
    I also bring a message from my Government that says to you, sir, we 
will work for human liberty and human dignity, in order to spread peace 
and compassion, that we appreciate the strong symbol of freedom that you 
have stood for, and we recognize the power of freedom to change 
societies and to change the world.
    And so, sir, we're honored to be here. Perhaps the best way I can 
express my country's gratitude to you and our respect to you is to 
present to you the Medal of Freedom from America. And if you might 
allow, I'd like to read the citation attached to that honor:
    ``A devoted servant of God, His Holiness Pope John Paul II has 
championed the cause of the poor, the weak, the hungry, and the outcast. 
He has defended the unique dignity of every life and the goodness of all 
life. Through his faith and moral conviction, he has given courage to 
others to be not afraid in overcoming injustice and oppression. His 
principled stand for peace and freedom has inspired millions and helped 
to topple communism and tyranny. The United States honors this son of 
Poland who became the Bishop of Rome and a hero of our time.''
    And so, on behalf of the American people, Your Holiness, I would be 
honored if you would accept our Medal of Freedom.

[The President and the First Lady presented the medal and congratulated 
Pope John Paul II.]

    Pope John Paul II. I am very grateful, Mr. President, for this 
thoughtful gesture. May the desire for freedom, peace, a more humane 
world symbolized by this medal inspire men and women of good will in 
every time and place.
    God bless America.

Note: The President spoke at 12:58 p.m. at the Epistolic Palace. The 
Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
transcript of these remarks.
