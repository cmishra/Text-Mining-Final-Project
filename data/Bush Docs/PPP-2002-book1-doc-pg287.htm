Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Reallocation of 
Emergency Response Funds
February 25, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    In furtherance of the provisions of Public Law 107-38, the Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to 
Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, today I am notifying 
the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred 
from the Emergency Response Fund to the Department of Defense. This 
reallocation reflects revised requirements in light of changing security 
needs in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
    As provided in Public Law 107-38, $33 million will be made available 
15 days from the date of this transmittal for continued deployment of 
the National Guard at our Nation's airports through the end of March.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his 
comments and observations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
February 26.
