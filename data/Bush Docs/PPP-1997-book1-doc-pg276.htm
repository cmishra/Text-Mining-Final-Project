Statement on Senator Wendell H. Ford's Decision Not To Seek Reelection
March 10, 1997

    Senator Wendell Ford has served his home State of Kentucky with 
pride and distinction for four terms as a Member of the U.S. Senate. He 
has been a leader in the Democratic Party and a personal friend for many 
years. Senator Ford's tireless efforts as a veteran, businessman, 
Lieutenant Governor, and Governor before coming to Washington have 
earned him the admiration of all who know him. I will miss his 
leadership and advice on Capitol Hill but know that he will continue to 
find ways to improve the lives of the constituents he has served so well 
for so long. Kentucky and the Nation are better for his dedication and 
service. Hillary and I wish him, his wife, Jean, and their family well 
in the years to come.
