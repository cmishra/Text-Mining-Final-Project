Remarks on the Situation in Burma
October 19, 2007

    Laura,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> thank you for joining--and Madam 
Secretary.<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> In the last few weeks, the world 
has been inspired by the courage of the Burmese people. Ordinary men and 
women have taken to the streets in peaceful marches to demand their 
freedom and call for democratic change. The world has also been 
horrified by the response of Burma's military junta. Monks have been 
beaten and killed. Thousands of prodemocracy protesters have been 
arrested. And Burma's dictator, Than Shwe,<Than Shwe<ls-thn-eq> 
continues to hold captive the leader of Burma's largest democratic 
party, Aung San Suu Kyi.<Aung San Suu Kyi<ls-thn-eq>
    Burma's rulers continue to defy the world's just demands to stop 
their vicious persecution. They continue to dismiss calls to begin 
peaceful dialog aimed at national reconciliation. Most of all, they 
continue to reject the clear will of the Burmese people to live in 
freedom under leaders of their own choosing.
    Last month, the United States tightened economic sanctions on the 
leaders of Burma's regime and imposed an expanded visa ban on those 
responsible for the most egregious violations of human rights, as well 
as their family members. The Treasury Department designated 14 top 
leaders of the Burmese regime for sanctions, including Than Shwe<Than 
Shwe<ls-thn-eq> and his deputy, Vice Senior General Maung Aye.<Maung 
Aye<ls-thn-eq> And the State Department added 260 names of Burmese 
officials and their family members to the visa ban list.
    In light of the ongoing atrocities by these men and their 
associates, the United States has today imposed additional sanctions.
    First, the Treasury Department has designated 11 more leaders of the 
Burmese junta for sanctions under existing authorities.
    Second, I've issued a new Executive order that designates an 
additional 12 individuals and entities for sanctions. This Executive 
order grants the Treasury Department expanded authority to designate for 
sanctions individuals responsible for human rights abuses, as well as 
public corruption,

and those who provide material and financial backing to these 
individuals or to the Government of Burma.
    Third, I have instructed our Commerce Department to tighten its 
export control regulations for Burma.
    Burmese authorities claim they desire reconciliation. Well, they 
need to match those words with actions. A good way to start would be to 
provide the International Committee of the Red Cross and other 
humanitarian organizations access to political prisoners, to allow Aung 
San Suu Kyi<Aung San Suu Kyi<ls-thn-eq> and other detained leaders to 
communicate with one another, and to permit Special Envoy 
Gambari<Gambari, Ibrahim Agboola<ls-thn-eq> to enter their country 
immediately. And ultimately, reconciliation requires that Burmese 
authorities release all political prisoners and begin negotiations with 
the democratic opposition under the auspices of the United Nations.
    We will continue to review our policies and consider additional 
measures if Burma's leaders do not end the brutal repression of their 
own people whose only offense is the desire to live in freedom. Business 
as usual is unacceptable. So I applaud the efforts of the European Union 
and nations like Australia that have announced targeted sanctions on the 
Burmese regime. I commend nations such as Japan that have curtailed 
their assistance to Burma in response to the atrocities. I appreciate 
nations such as Singapore and the Philippines and Indonesia, who have 
spoken out against the atrocities. I ask other countries to review their 
own laws and policies, especially Burma's closest neighbors: China, 
India, and others in the region.
    The people of Burma are showing great courage in the face of immense 
repression. They are appealing for our help. We must not turn a deaf ear 
to their cries. They do have many friends around the world, including 
Laura.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> I am proud of Laura for all she has done 
to awaken the conscience of the world to the plight of the Burmese 
people. I believe no nation can forever suppress its own people. And we 
are confident that the day is coming when freedom's tide will reach the 
shores of Burma.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 1:47 p.m. in the Diplomatic Reception Room 
at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to First Lady Laura 
Bush; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; and United Nations Special 
Adviser to the Secretary-General on Myanmar Ibrahim Gambari. The 
President also referred to Executive Order 13448.
