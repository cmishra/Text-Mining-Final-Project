Remarks Following a Meeting With President Joseph Kabila<Kabila, 
Joseph<ls-thn-eq> of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
October 26, 2007

    President Bush. It's my honor to welcome back to the Oval Office 
President Kabila. Thanks for coming, sir, the President of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. The last time the President was here, 
we talked about his desire to have free and fair elections in his 
country. Since that time, his country has had free and

fair elections. And my first order of business today was to congratulate 
the President for garnering 58 percent of the vote.
    We talked about the need to work together to help consolidate the 
gains. We talked about the need to--for the United States to partner 
with the country to help on economic development. One of the things the 
President recognizes is the need for there to be investment in his 
country, so people can find work and the stability that comes with 
economic development. And I appreciate your recognition of the 
opportunity to work together.
    We talked about the eastern part of his country. And he shared with 
me his strategy to make sure that the Government's reach extends 
throughout the entire country and that there is stability throughout the 
country. And I want to thank you very much for sharing your thoughts 
with me.
    I did bring up my desire to help our friend deal with malaria. 
Malaria is a great concern to me and my wife<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and 
the Secretary of State.<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> This is an issue 
that can be solved. We hurt when young babies are dying from a mosquito 
bite, knowing full well that a strategy can help save lives. And so the 
President shares the same sense of compassion I do for people all 
throughout the world who are being affected by malaria.
    Mr. President, you are--you've said that you wanted there to be free 
and fair elections, and you delivered. And I appreciate that and 
congratulate you on being a man of your word. And we look forward to 
continuing to work with you, sir, to bring peace and stability to the 
neighborhood. So, welcome.
    President Kabila. Thanks a lot. Well, Mr. President, thanks a lot. 
Of course, this is the second time that we meet in the Oval Office. And 
way back, yes, elections was high on the agenda in 2003. We organized 
those elections. And basically, our priorities have now changed from 
elections; it's now stability, and with stability, peace and 
development. And I emphasized and insisted on the fact that we need 
continued support from the United States in order to achieve these two 
remaining goals, which is peace and stability throughout the whole 
country, and embark on a very, very long journey of development and 
really try to combat poverty, which is the biggest issue not only in the 
Congo but in the region and on the African Continent.
    So thanks a lot for the continued support that we've always had from 
the United States Government and the administration. And together, let's 
move further and further ahead.
    President Bush. Yes, sir.
    President Kabila.  Thank you.
    President Bush. Glad you're here. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 9:51 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House.
