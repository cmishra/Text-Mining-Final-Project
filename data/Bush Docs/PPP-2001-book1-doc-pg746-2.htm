Statement on House of Representatives Action on Community Solutions 
Legislation
June 28, 2001

    I commend the House Judiciary Committee for passing legislation that 
offers hope to tens of millions of people at risk, including 15 million 
children. I believe strongly that Government should support programs 
that work to save and change lives of those in need.

[[Page 747]]

    I look forward to action by the Ways and Means Committee and urge 
the House to pass this legislation as soon possible.

Note: The proposed ``Community Solutions Act of 2001'' is H.R. 7.
