Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation To Reauthorize the 
Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act
December 9, 2006

    In 1990, Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources 
Emergency (CARE) Act to advance our domestic battle against HIV/AIDS. 
This landmark legislation has provided Americans in need with better 
access to medical care, antiretroviral treatments, and counseling and 
has helped them live longer lives. The act also supports HIV testing to 
prevent the further spread of this devastating disease.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I thank the House and Senate for 
reauthorizing the Ryan White CARE Act. This legislation focuses on 
lifesaving and life-extending services and increased accountability and 
will provide more flexibility to the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services to direct funding to areas of greatest need. The Ryan White 
CARE Act demonstrates the compassionate and generous spirit of America, 
and I look forward to signing this important legislation into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 6143.
