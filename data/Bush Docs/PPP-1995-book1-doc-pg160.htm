Message to the Congress on Trade With Armenia, the Bahamas, and Israel
February 3, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program offers duty-free 
treatment to specified products that are imported from designated 
beneficiary countries. It is authorized by the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended.
    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Armenia to the list 
of beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP program. I 
have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 and 
502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, I have 
determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Armenia.
    I am also writing to inform you of my decision to terminate the 
designation of The Bahamas and the designation of Israel as beneficiary 
developing countries for purposes of the GSP program. Pursuant to 
section 504(f) of the Trade Act of 1974, I have determined that the per 
capita gross national products of The Bahamas and of Israel have 
exceeded the applicable limit provided for in section 504(f). 
Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to terminate the 
designation of The Bahamas and Israel as GSP beneficiaries.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with sections 502(a)(1) and 
502(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 3, 1995.

Note: The related proclamation is listed in Appendix D at the end of 
this volume.
