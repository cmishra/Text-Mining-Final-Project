Statement on the Deaths of Firefighters in Charleston, South Carolina
June 19, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I mourn the devastating loss of 
some of America's bravest. Our prayers are with the families and friends 
of nine firefighters from Charleston, South Carolina, who selflessly 
gave their own lives to protect their community. These firefighters were 
true heroes who demonstrated great skill and courage. Their unwavering 
commitment to their neighbors and to the city of Charleston is an 
inspiration to all Americans.
