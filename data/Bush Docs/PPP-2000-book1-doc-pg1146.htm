Statement on House of Representatives Action on Electronic Signatures 
Legislation
June 14, 2000

    I am pleased that the House today adopted the electronic signatures 
conference report by an overwhelming vote. I expect similar support in 
the Senate for this bipartisan agreement and look forward to signing 
this key legislation into law.
    This historic legislation will ensure that our consumer protections 
apply when Americans do business on-line. It will encourage the 
information technology revolution that has helped lower inflation, raise 
productivity, and spur new research and development. By marrying one of 
our oldest values--our commitment to consumer protection--with the 
newest technologies, we can achieve the full measure of the benefits 
that E-commerce has to offer. My congratulations to the Democratic and 
Republican leaders of the conference committee who worked together to 
forge this landmark legislation.
