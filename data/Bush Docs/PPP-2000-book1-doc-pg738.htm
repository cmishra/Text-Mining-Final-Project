Message on the Observance of Passover, 2000
April 17, 2000

    Warm greetings to all those celebrating Passover.
    Each year, Jews across America and around the world celebrate this 
sacred holiday by gathering with family and friends to share a festive 
ritual meal and to retell the story of Passover.
    As children read from the Haggadah, a new generation learns the 
ancient story of God's liberation of the Israelites from slavery in 
Egypt and of their arduous 40-year journey through the desert. By 
singing songs, reciting prayers, and sharing food and drink steeped in 
tradition and symbolism, children learn to appreciate the rich history 
of the Jewish people, the importance of religious freedom, and the many 
blessings God brings to our lives.
    This year, as families gather for the seder to once again tell the 
story of Passover and of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, 
let us all give thanks for God's grace in our lives and for the 
wonderful blessings of liberty. And let us pray for a future filled with 
peace, hope, and opportunity for all the children of the world.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a joyous Passover 
celebration.

                                                            Bill Clinton
