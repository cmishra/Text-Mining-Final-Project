Statement on the Situation in Kosovo
May 13, 1998

    I welcome the news that President Milosevic<Milosevic, 
Slobodan<ls-thn-eq> and Dr. Ibrahim Rugova<Rugova, Ibrahim<ls-thn-eq> 
will meet on May 15 in Belgrade to initiate a dialog without 
preconditions.
    As Ambassadors Holbrooke<Holbrooke, Richard C.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Gelbard<Gelbard, Robert S.<ls-thn-eq> announced earlier today, the 
parties have also agreed to continue this dialog in a series of talks in 
Pristina.
    This is a sober first step towards resolving a very dangerous 
conflict that clearly has the potential to spill over into neighboring 
countries and destabilize the region.
    There is a great deal more to be done, however, before all the 
peoples of Kosovo enjoy the peace, security, and human rights they 
deserve. The parties face a complex challenge, but success is up to 
them. We expect each to make

good their commitment to serious and productive dialog.
    We should be mindful of the difficult road ahead, but we are 
encouraged to see this process underway.
