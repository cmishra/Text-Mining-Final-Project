Statement on Senate Passage of Legislation Concerning the Transportation 
of Minors Across State Lines
July 25, 2006

    Transporting minors across State lines to bypass parental consent 
laws regarding abortion undermines State law and jeopardizes the lives 
of young women. To combat this dangerous practice, the Senate today 
passed the ``Child Custody Protection Act,'' which penalizes those who 
unlawfully attempt to circumvent parental notification requirements.
    I appreciate the Senate's efforts to preserve the integrity of State 
law and protect our Nation's families. I look forward to the House and 
Senate resolving their differences in conference and sending this 
legislation for my signature.

Note: The statement referred to S. 403.
