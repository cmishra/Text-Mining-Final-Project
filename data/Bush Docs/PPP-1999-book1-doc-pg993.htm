Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on the Americans with 
Disabilities Act
June 22, 1999

    I am pleased that the Supreme Court decision's in the Olmstead case 
upholds the purposes of the ADA by recognizing that unjustified 
isolation of institutionalized persons with disabilities is prohibited 
discrimination. This decision will increase access to home- and 
community-based long-term care services and support for these persons.
    My administration is committed to finding affordable ways to enable 
people who need long-term services and support to remain in the 
community if they choose and are able to do so. The best way to continue 
progress toward this goal is for State governments, the Federal 
Government, and the affected communities to work

together to develop cost-effective ways to provide these services. We 
must ensure that the quality of these services is excellent and that 
they are available to persons with disabilities of all ages.
    Therefore, I am asking Secretary Shalala<Shalala, Donna 
E.> and Attorney General Reno<Reno, Janet> to work 
with all interested parties to carry out today's decision in a fair and 
effective manner. Although this may not be easy in some cases, we can do 
it by working together in order to advance the goals of the ADA. Our 
ultimate goal is a nation that integrates people with disabilities into 
the social mainstream, promotes equality of opportunity, and maximizes 
individual choice.
