Statement on Senate Action To Vote on the Nomination of Samuel A. Alito, 
Jr.,<Alito, Samuel A., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> To Be an Associate Justice of the 
United States Supreme Court
January 30, 2006

    I am pleased that a strong, bipartisan majority in the Senate 
decisively rejected attempts to obstruct and filibuster an up-or-down 
vote on Judge Sam Alito's nomination. The Senate has a constitutional 
responsibility to hold an up-or-down vote on every judicial nominee, and 
throughout its 216-year history, the Senate has held an up-or-down vote 
on every Supreme Court nominee with majority Senate support. Judge Alito 
is extraordinarily well-qualified to serve on our Nation's highest 
Court, and America is fortunate that this good and humble man is willing 
to serve. I look forward to the Senate voting to confirm Sam Alito as 
the 110th Justice of the Supreme Court.
