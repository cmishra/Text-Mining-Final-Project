Statement on Improving Border Security and Immigration Within Existing 
Law
August 10, 2007

    Today members of my Cabinet announced a series of important new 
administrative actions to address border security and immigration 
challenges. These reforms represent steps my administration can take 
within the boundaries of existing law to better secure our borders, 
improve worksite enforcement, streamline existing temporary-worker 
programs, and help new immigrants assimilate into American society.
    Although the Congress has not addressed our broken immigration 
system by passing comprehensive reform legislation, my administration 
will continue to take every possible step to build upon the progress 
already made in strengthening our borders, enforcing our worksite laws, 
keeping our economy well-supplied with vital workers, and helping new 
Americans learn English.
    I appreciate the work of Secretary Chertoff<Chertoff, 
Michael<ls-thn-eq> and Secretary Gutierrez<Gutierrez, Carlos 
M.<ls-thn-eq> in implementing these important reforms, which will 
improve our security and enrich our Nation.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
