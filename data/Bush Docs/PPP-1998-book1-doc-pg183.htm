Letter to the Members of the Federal Election Commission on Campaign 
Finance Reform
February 5, 1998

To the Members of the Federal Election Commission:
    I strongly support action to end the soft money raised by both 
political parties. That is why last year I asked the Federal Election 
Commission to ban soft money, under its current legal authority. I am 
very pleased that your General Counsel<Noble, Lawrence M.<ls-thn-eq> has 
proposed a new rule prohibiting national parties from raising soft 
money. Banning soft money fundraising by national party committees will 
enable our election laws to catch up with the reality of the way 
elections are financed today, and along with new campaign finance reform 
legislation, will take significant strides toward restoring public 
confidence in the campaign finance process.
    Now I ask you to step up to your responsibility and act, within your 
legal authority, to end the soft money system. The American people 
deserve nothing less.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton
