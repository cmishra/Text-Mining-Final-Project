Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Northern 
Ireland
December 13, 2002

Dear Mr. Chairman:
    I am transmitting to you a report prepared by my Administration as 
required by section 701(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228).
    The enclosed report broadly addresses policing reform and human 
rights in Northern Ireland. It provides information on topics of 
interest outlined by the Congress, including details on paramilitary 
decommissioning, and the manner in which U.S. law enforcement training 
for members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland is being 
administered.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Joseph R. Biden, Jr., chairman, 
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and Henry J. Hyde, chairman, 
House Committee on International Relations.
