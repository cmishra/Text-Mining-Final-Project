Statement on Apprehension of Suspects in the Washington Area Sniper 
Attacks
October 24, 2002

    The entire Nation is grateful to all of the local, State, and 
Federal law enforcement officials who have worked with such great 
urgency and with so little rest to solve the sniper case. Their efforts 
resulted in the apprehension of those considered suspects in the sniper 
shootings. We are also grateful to the citizens who kept their eyes open 
and provided information to the police. We will keep the victims and 
their families and friends in our thoughts and prayers. The hunt for a 
merciless killer has been difficult--and America greatly appreciates all 
the good men and women who fight crime and uphold justice across this 
great country.
