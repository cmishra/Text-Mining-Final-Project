Statement on the Death of G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery<Montgomery, G.V. 
``Sonny''<ls-thn-eq>
May 12, 2006

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I and the entire Bush family are 
saddened by the death of a good friend and patriot, Sonny Montgomery. 
Sonny Montgomery served during World War II and the Korean war, and he 
was a tireless advocate for America's veterans throughout his three 
decades in the House of Representatives. He sponsored the Montgomery GI 
bill, which has helped make higher education and professional training 
accessible to millions of our veterans. In 2005, he was awarded the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civil award, in 
recognition of his lifetime of service to the United States. We send our 
condolences and prayers to the Montgomery family.
