Message to the Senate Transmitting the Portugal-United States
Taxation Convention and Protocol
September 15, 1994

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the United States of America and the Portuguese 
Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of 
Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, together with a related 
Protocol, signed at Washington on September 6, 1994. Also transmitted 
for the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of 
State with respect to the Convention.
    The Convention is the first income tax convention between the United 
States of America and the Portuguese Republic. The Convention reflects 
current income tax treaty policies of the two countries.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Convention and related Protocol and give its advice and consent 
to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
September 15, 1994.
