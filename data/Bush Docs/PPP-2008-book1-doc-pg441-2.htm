Statement on the Resignation of Alphonso R. Jackson<Jackson, Alphonso 
R.<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
March 31, 2008

    Today Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson 
announced his decision to leave the Department after 7 years of 
dedicated service. I have known Alphonso Jackson for many years, and I 
have known him to be a strong leader and a good man. I have accepted his 
resignation with regret.
    Secretary Jackson is a great American success story. The youngest of 
12 children--his father was a foundry worker, and his mother<Jackson, 
Henrietta<ls-thn-eq> was a nurse midwife--Alphonso has always understood 
the value of hard

work and equal opportunity for all Americans.
    For more than three decades, he has worked to help more Americans 
become homeowners and strengthen communities throughout our Nation. 
While leading the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Alphonso 
made significant progress in transforming public housing, revitalizing 
and modernizing the Federal Housing Administration, increasing 
affordable housing, rebuilding the Gulf Coast, decreasing homelessness, 
and increasing minority homeownership.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I treasure our strong friendship 
with Secretary Jackson, his wife Marcia,<Jackson, Marcia<ls-thn-eq> 
their daughters Annette<Jackson, Annette<ls-thn-eq> and Lesley,<Jackson, 
Lesley<ls-thn-eq> and their granddaughter Lauren.<Jackson, 
Lauren<ls-thn-eq> We wish them all the best.
