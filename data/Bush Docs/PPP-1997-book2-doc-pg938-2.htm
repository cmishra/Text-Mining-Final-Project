Statement on the New Television Rating System
July 10, 1997

    Two years ago, Vice President Gore and I challenged Congress and the 
television industry to give parents new tools to control the television 
children watch. We were pleased with their response. Last year, Congress 
passed legislation giving American families the V-chip, and the industry 
developed a voluntary system of ratings for television programs. Today 
these tools are being made stronger. The television industry, working 
with parents, has strengthened its original rating system by agreeing to 
assign new ratings that will better help families choose appropriate 
television programming for their children.
    When Vice President Gore asked parents to tell us how the original 
rating system was working--where it was succeeding, and where it could 
be improved--parents told us that age-based ratings are helpful, but 
that they needed to know more about the specific programming content. 
The new system gives parents more information about the images and 
language contained in programs and more power to screen out violence and 
objectionable content.
    I applaud the industry and parent groups who have worked so hard to 
reach common ground. As with any new system, we should now give this 
solution--together with the V-chip--a chance to work.
