Statement on Proposed Back to Work Relief Legislation
October 11, 2001

    I commend Senators Allen<Allen, George> and Warner<Warner, 
John W.> and others for introducing my ``Back to Work Relief 
Package.'' I look forward to continuing to work with members of both 
parties to enact this important relief for dislocated workers across 
America as soon as possible. This proposal will help get workers who 
lost their jobs because of the September 11 attacks back to work again.
