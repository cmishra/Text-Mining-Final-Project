Statement on the 70th Anniversary of Social Security
August 14, 2005

    For 70 years, Social Security has been a vital program and helped 
millions of America's seniors in retirement. The Social Security system 
is sound for today's seniors, but there is a hole in the safety net for 
younger workers. On this 70th anniversary, we renew our commitment to 
save and strengthen Social Security for our children and grandchildren 
and keep the promise of Social Security for future generations.
