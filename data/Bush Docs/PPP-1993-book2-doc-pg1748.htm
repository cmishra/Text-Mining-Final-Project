Statement on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
October 14, 1993

    Audiovisual services must be included in any GATT accord. The United 
States does not want any special favors for American audiovisual 
creative works, but we also cannot accept that audio products be singled 
out for unacceptable restrictions. The United States is ready to sign a 
GATT accord that is fair and just for all. But let me make it clear that 
fairness and justice must apply to audiovisual works as well as other 
elements in a final GATT deal. This is a vital jobs issue as well as a 
fairness issue for America.
    Finally, let me say once again that the Uruguay round is very 
important to the restoration of global growth, and that is why it is 
essential that we finish this agreement by December 15. That deadline is 
firm, and our trading partners must be prepared to settle with us on the 
many outstanding issues if we are to succeed.
