Remarks at the Kennedy Center Honors Reception
December 7, 2003

    Thank you all very much. Good evening, and welcome to the White 
House. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are pleased to have you all 
here, and we are so honored to be a part of this annual tradition. We 
especially welcome the 2003 Kennedy Center honorees and their family and 
their friends.
    Every year, the Kennedy Center pays tribute to five outstanding 
artists. Each group of honorees is an interesting mix. [Laughter] This 
year, for example, we have a director whose best films are known to all. 
We have an actress<Burnett, Carol<ls-thn-eq> who has created characters 
we all remember, who, I'm told, still does a mighty good Tarzan yell. 
[Laughter] And the<Perlman, Itzhak<ls-thn-eq> three<Brown, James J., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> musicians<Nichols, Mike<ls-thn-eq> with us are among the 
most recognized in the world. They're not known to have performed 
together--[laughter]--but the sight of all three on the same stage is a 
picture to remember.
    The Kennedy Center Honors recognize great contributions to American 
culture. Each of the honorees is here because of their hard effort and 
superior performance through an entire career.
    Only one honoree was born in Texas. [Laughter] That person is Carol 
Burnett,<Burnett, Carol<ls-thn-eq> who spent her early years in San 
Antonio. Young Carol went off into the world, and the world took a 
liking to her from the start. She is today one of the most recognized 
and warmly regarded entertainers in America.
    For her first performance in acting class at UCLA, the teacher gave 
Carol Burnett<Burnett, Carol<ls-thn-eq> a ``D-''. [Laughter] But Carol 
found, as have I--[laughter]--that one bad grade or two--[laughter]--is 
not the end of the road. [Laughter]
    By the end of her freshman year, she<Burnett, Carol<ls-thn-eq> was 
named ``Most Outstanding Newcomer.'' Within a few years, she became a 
star on Broadway and a television favorite on the Winchell-Mahoney Show 
and the Garry Moore Show. In the sixties and seventies, Carol's own 
variety show ran 11 years and received more than 20 Emmys. Every week, 
Carol performed one of the most difficult feats in all of show business, 
playing it straight with Tim Conway. [Laughter]
    To this day, millions of Americans can instantly recall sketches and 
characters from the Carol Burnett Show. Whether she<Burnett, 
Carol<ls-thn-eq> was playing Eunice or the Scrub Woman or Starlett 
O'Hara in ``Went With The Wind''--[laughter]--viewers could always sense 
the person behind the character, the sweetness, the sincerity, and the 
wonderful spirit of Carol Burnett.
    Through the years in such performances as ``Same Time Next Year,'' 
Carol<Burnett, Carol<ls-thn-eq> has also shown the depth and range of 
her talent. In her good life, she has been a beloved entertainer, a 
devoted mom, and a faithful friend. She is a cheerful and graceful 
presence in American life, and America honors Carol Burnett.

    All great performances in front of a camera involve an artistic 
vision behind the camera, and few have spent more years at the top of 
the directing profession than Mike Nichols.<Nichols, Mike<ls-thn-eq> His 
name on a production signifies quality, intelligence, and high artistic 
standards. His credits include some of the most memorable films of the 
last two generations. ``The Graduate'' was a hit movie and a triumph 
that has held up over time.
    The best directors are always extending themselves, and Mike 
Nichols<Nichols, Mike<ls-thn-eq> has turned his gifts to films as varied 
as ``Catch-22,'' ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' and ``Working 
Girl.'' He<Nichols, Mike<ls-thn-eq> is equally respected for his career 
on Broadway, first as a performer, then as director of the original 
``Odd Couple'' and ``Barefoot in the Park.'' The medal Mike Nichols 
wears this evening is the latest in a collection of other well-deserved 
honors, including the Oscar, the Emmy, the Tony, and the Grammy.
    A movie critic once said that Mike Nichols'<Nichols, Mike<ls-thn-eq> 
greatest talent may be his ability to bring out the best in performers, 
and that is another reason why Mike Nichols is among the finest.
    Mike<Nichols, Mike<ls-thn-eq> has summed up his career this way: ``I 
have been in love with movies all my life. Directing them is like 
getting to marry this girl you followed around for years and years.'' I 
don't know how long he followed around Diane<Sawyer, Diane<ls-thn-eq> 
Sawyer--[laughter]--but she is here to share in this very proud moment.
    And Mike's<Nichols, Mike<ls-thn-eq> parents, who brought their 
little boy to America from Nazi Germany, would also be proud of their 
son. And tonight we are really proud to honor this fine man, Mike 
Nichols.
    During this evening's reception, we will hear music from the Marine 
Band. I suspect that these fine musicians are thrilled to be in the 
presence of one of the greatest violinists<Perlman, Itzhak<ls-thn-eq> of 
his age or any other.
    As it happens, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I were guests in 
this very room when Itzhak Perlman<Perlman, Itzhak<ls-thn-eq> performed 
for President<Reagan, Ronald W.<ls-thn-eq> and Mrs. Reagan.<Reagan, 
Nancy<ls-thn-eq> That audience, like every audience to hear this man, 
was captivated by his music and charmed by his presence. According to a 
review of a recent concert in Minneapolis, ``Perlman maintained an 
intimate rapport with the audience. For instance, he kept them updated 
on the score of the World Series between pieces.'' [Laughter] He was 
clearly having fun, and so was his audience.
    The sound of a violin first called to him<Perlman, Itzhak<ls-thn-eq> 
over the radio when he was just 3 years old. The Perlmans gave their boy 
a toy fiddle. He soon exhausted the possibilities of that instrument. 
Armed with a real violin, he was onstage with orchestras in Tel Aviv and 
Jerusalem and by the age 10 had given his first solo recital. America 
first came to know him<Perlman, Itzhak<ls-thn-eq> 3 years later, when in 
1958 he played ``Flight of the Bumblebee'' on the Ed Sullivan show. From 
that day to this, Itzhak Perlman has had a unique hold on the respect 
and affection of all who love classical music. He<Perlman, 
Itzhak<ls-thn-eq> has played with every major orchestra in the world. 
He's collected more than a dozen Grammys, enthralled listeners with a 
repertoire stretching from baroque to contemporary, and touched millions 
of filmgoers with the pure and haunting solos in ``Schindler's List.''
    Critics have written of Perlman's<Perlman, Itzhak<ls-thn-eq> 
technical mastery, the rich tone and faultless intonation. And all who 
have seen him play are struck by the apparent ease with which he plays 
the most demanding of instruments. This good soul has been given a 
singular talent, and in sharing it he has brought much beauty into the 
world. For that, we are all honored to be in the presence of Maestro 
Itzhak Perlman.
    Speaking of soul--[laughter]--James ``Butane'' Brown<Brown, James 
J., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> is in the house. Of course, he goes by other titles. 
Some men are too cool to only have one nickname. James Brown has been 
called ``Mr. Dynamite,'' ``Soul Brother Number One,'' and of course, 
``The Godfather of Soul.'' Many names fit him, but there's no one else 
like him. And in a career of more than 50 years,

[[Page 1693]]

he has earned the reputation as a live performer with no equal and as an 
institution of rock and roll.
    He<Brown, James J., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> grew up in Georgia, knowing many 
of the toils and struggles of an earlier time. He worked hard and took 
his own path. He received guidance along the way from many sources, from 
his Aunt Honey, who raised him, to the first preachers and gospel 
musicians he heard. He<Brown, James J., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> joined a band 
that called itself ``The Famous Flames.'' It took only a short while 
before the name was changed, by general agreement, to ``James Brown and 
the Famous Flames.'' [Laughter] When you hear the title of a James Brown 
song, right away you can picture him singing it: ``I Feel Good,'' 
``Please, Please, Please,'' ``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,'' ``Living in 
America.''
    Since he<Brown, James J., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> first achieved fame in the 
1950s, James has posted 98 entries on Billboard's Top 40 R&B Singles 
Chart, more than any other performer. Bonnie Raitt<Raitt, 
Bonnie<ls-thn-eq> has described James Brown's place in music history 
this way, ``You couldn't even list how many people have been influenced 
by him. In the Mount Rushmore of musical figures, he definitely would be 
on it.''
    Of course, on that Mount Rushmore of music, the sculptor would have 
to pay particular attention to the hair. [Laughter] James<Brown, James 
J., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> is the first to tell you that the look is important 
to his success. Here's what he says, ``Hair is the first thing, and 
teeth are the second.'' [Laughter] ``Hair and teeth, a man got these two 
things, he's got it all.'' [Laughter]
    The truth is, James Brown<Brown, James J., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> was being 
awfully modest. Along with the look, this man is blessed with incredible 
talent, undeniable stage presence, and the discipline of a true 
professional. He's still on the road and living it up--living up to that 
other nickname, ``the hardest working man in show business.'' Our 
congratulations to James Joe Brown, Junior.
    We are delighted to welcome our final honoree to the White House. 
Loretta Lynn<Lynn, Loretta<ls-thn-eq> even mentioned the White House in 
one of her songs. Since I don't have a band right here and since I can't 
sing--[laughter]--I'll just say the words, and you can imagine Loretta 
singing them: ``The White House social season should be glittering and 
gay, but here in Topeka the rain is a-falling, the faucet is a-dripping, 
and the kids are a-bawling''--[laughter]--``one of them a-toddling, and 
one is a-crawling, and one's on the way.'' [Laughter]
    Many of Loretta Lynn's<Lynn, Loretta<ls-thn-eq> songs are about the 
challenges, the dreams, and the joys of everyday life. She's known them 
all, and she has sung about them with style and feeling. More than four 
decades after she first sang at the Grand Ole Opry, there is no better 
known voice in country music and no lady more admired than Loretta Lynn.
    Her song and the film ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' tell a true story 
that began in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky. Loretta<Lynn, Loretta<ls-thn-eq> 
grew up believing, in her words, that ``from the Holler down to the mine 
was the whole world.''
    Her world changed when she<Lynn, Loretta<ls-thn-eq> met a soldier 
named Mooney Lynn.<Lynn, Mooney<ls-thn-eq> He made a strong impression 
on people. See, Mooney was the kind of man who wore a cowboy hat with a 
label inside that said, ``Like hell it's yours.'' [Laughter] But as 
Loretta remembers, ``I wasn't scared of Mooney. He was real nice. I was 
scared because I had never seen a car before.'' [Laughter] They married 
and moved away and were living in the State of Washington when Mooney 
got an idea. He knew that the voice singing lullabies to their children 
was better than any he had ever heard from a jukebox or in a saloon. And 
just maybe if Loretta cut a record, radio stations might play it.
    That notion has been proven correct in more than 70 record albums, 
27 number one singles, and 80 chart hits, from ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' 
to ``Love is the Foundation'' to ``Don't Come Home A Drinkin' With 
Lovin' on Your Mind.'' [Laughter]
    Loretta<Lynn, Loretta<ls-thn-eq> has received every top honor in 
country music and is loved for her own

songs and for her wonderful duets with the late Conway Twitty. Her 
appeal has been explained this way, ``She's straightforward, down home, 
innocent, and perfectly charming. Everyone loves her.'' And this 
evening, that unanimous opinion is expressed once again, and the Nation 
pays tribute to Loretta Lynn.
    Americans are grateful to these<Lynn, Loretta<ls-thn-eq> 
Kennedy<Nichols, Mike<ls-thn-eq> Center<Perlman, Itzhak<ls-thn-eq> 
honorees<Brown, James J., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> because you have all given us 
wonderful memories. You have given your peers a high mark to aim for. 
Each of you in your own way has given America a body of work that 
reflects so very well on our Nation. Thank you for contributions to 
America. May God continue to bless you. Thank you for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 5:05 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to musician Bonnie Raitt.
