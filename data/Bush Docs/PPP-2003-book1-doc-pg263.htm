Statement on Senate Action on Legislation To Ban Partial-Birth Abortion
March 13, 2003

    Partial-birth abortion is an abhorrent procedure that offends human 
dignity, and I commend the Senate for passing legislation to ban it. 
Today's action is an important step toward building a culture of life in 
America. I look forward to the House passing legislation and working 
with the Senate to resolve any differences so that I can sign 
legislation banning partial-birth abortion into law.
