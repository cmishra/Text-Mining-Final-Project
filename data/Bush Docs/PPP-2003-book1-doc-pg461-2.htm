Statement on Proposed Legislation To Increase Salaries for the Federal 
Judiciary
May 9, 2003

    I am pleased to support legislation introduced in the Senate this 
week that would increase the annual salaries of Justices and judges of 
the United States. This bipartisan legislation, S. 1023, responds to the 
recommendation of the Chief Justice and the Judicial Conference that 
salary increases be enacted for the Judiciary.
