Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation To Create a 
Department of Homeland Security
July 26, 2002

    I commend the House of Representatives for acting quickly to pass 
landmark legislation to create a Homeland Security Department. This 
legislation represents the most extensive reorganization of the Federal 
Government since the 1940s. Our Nation needs a new department with the 
overriding mission of protecting the American people from the threats of 
terrorism.
    This bill includes the major components of my proposal--providing 
for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, strengthening 
our borders, improving the use of science and technology to counter 
weapons of mass destruction, and enhancing our preparedness and response 
capabilities.
    The House bill also provides the Secretary of Homeland Security 
managerial flexibility needed to build and maintain a department capable 
of responding rapidly to the terrorist threats of the 21st century.
    The House has shown a strong commitment to improving the security of 
the American people, and I urge the Senators to do the same before they 
leave for the August recess.
