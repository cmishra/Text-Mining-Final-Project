Subject: Expediting Federal Decisions Relating to the Siting and 
Operation of Power Plants in California

    Governor Davis of California has directed State and local agencies 
to expedite the review and licensing of new power generation facilities, 
and he has requested that Federal agencies do the same.
    The Federal Government should make every effort to work with 
California and to help its citizens. I hereby direct all relevant 
Federal agencies to expedite Federal permit reviews and decision 
procedures with respect to the siting and operation of power plants in 
California. All actions taken must be consistent with statute and ensure 
continued protection of public health and the environment while 
preserving appropriate opportunities for public participation.

                                                          George W. Bush

 Note:  This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press
