Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Telephone Call to 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel
April 13, 1994

    The President called Prime Minister Rabin of Israel this afternoon 
to express his condolences over the killings of Israeli civilians in 
Hadera and to express his sense of urgency regarding concluding the 
agreement on implementation of the Israel-Palestinian Declaration of 
Principles. Prime Minister Rabin agreed with the President that it was 
important to accelerate the negotiations and reach prompt agreement. 
Both leaders underscored the need to ensure that the enemies of peace do 
not succeed. The President made it clear that the United States was 
ready to do its part to ensure that the negotiations reached a 
successful conclusion as rapidly as possible.
