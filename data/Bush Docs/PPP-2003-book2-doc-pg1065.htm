Statement on the Report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board
August 26, 2003

    Today the Columbia Accident Investigation Board released its report 
on the tragic accident that claimed the lives of seven brave astronauts. 
These men and women assumed great risk in service to all humanity. On 
behalf of a grateful Nation, I once again recognize their sacrifices and 
those of their loved ones. Their service will never be forgotten.
    Our Nation also owes its appreciation to Admiral Harold Gehman, 
Jr.<Gehman, Harold, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> (retired) as well as the other 12 
members of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. As Board Chair, 
Admiral Gehman and his team have worked tirelessly over the past seven 
months conducting an exhaustive review of the circumstances surrounding 
this accident. The next steps for NASA under Sean O'Keefe's<O'Keefe, 
Sean<ls-thn-eq> leadership must be determined after a thorough review of 
the entire report, including its recommendations.
    Our journey into space will go on. The work of the crew of the 
Columbia and the heroic explorers who traveled before them will 
continue.
