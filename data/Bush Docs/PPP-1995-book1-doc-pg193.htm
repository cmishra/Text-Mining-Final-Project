Radio Address to the People of Burundi
February 13, 1995

    The recent violence in Burundi demonstrates that extremists want to 
reverse your remarkable progress toward democracy. The United States 
rejects those who reject peace. We stand with those who are against 
violence and for tolerance and peace. Burundi has suffered enough.
    Your historic elections in 1993 promised to open a new, peaceful 
chapter in your nation's history. The American people and supporters of 
democracy around the world watched with high hopes as Burundi embarked 
on a new course. Despite tragedy and suffering, the vast majority of 
your people have worked for lasting peace, security, and freedom.
    I say to the people and the leaders of Burundi: Do not go back. You 
deserve to live in peace and without fear. Democracy will help you build 
a better future for yourselves and your children. Say no to violence and 
extremism. Say yes to peace and reconciliation.

Note: The address was recorded on February 11 at approximately 10:15 
a.m. in the Oval Office at the White House, and it was released by the 
Office of the Press Secretary on February 13. A tape was not available 
for verification of the content of this address.
