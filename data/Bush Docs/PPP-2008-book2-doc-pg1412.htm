Statement on Senator Mel Martinez's<Martinez, Melquiades R. 
``Mel''<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not to Seek Reelection
December 2, 2008

    Throughout his distinguished career, Senator Mel Martinez has been a 
wonderful public servant. Mel's life story is a testament to the power 
of the American Dream. Since immigrating to the United States from Cuba 
at the age of 15 as a part of Operation Pedro Pan, he has taken on big 
challenges and built a record of achievement.
    By becoming our country's first Cuban American Cabinet member as 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the first Cuban American 
United States Senator, he has been a source of inspiration to people all 
across our country. As general chairman of the Republican National 
Committee, he worked to strengthen our party and expand outreach to new 
audiences. In addition, he has been a passionate voice for freedom in 
his native country.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I thank Mel for his leadership and 
friendship over the past 8 years, and we wish him and Kitty<Martinez, 
Kathryn ``Kitty''<ls-thn-eq> the best as he finishes his career in the 
Senate and afterward.
