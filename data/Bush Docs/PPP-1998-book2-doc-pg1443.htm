Memorandum on Assistance for Federal Employees Affected by the Embassy 
Bombings in Kenya and Tanzania
August 12, 1998

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Assistance for Federal Employees Affected by the Bombings at 
U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania

    I am deeply saddened by the loss of life and suffering caused by the 
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, 
Tanzania. I convey my deepest sympathy and heartfelt sorrow to those 
affected by these senseless acts of violence. The Federal Government is 
committed to assist employees and their families in responding to this 
tragedy.
    As part of this effort, I ask the heads of executive departments and 
agencies having Federal civilian employees affected by the bombings 
(including Foreign Service National employees) to excuse from duty, 
without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is 
prevented from reporting to work or faced with a personal emergency 
because of the bombings and who can be spared from his or her usual 
responsibilities. This policy should also be applied to any

employee who is needed for security, relief, or recovery efforts as 
authorized by the chief of mission at each embassy.
    I am also directing the Office of Personnel Management to establish 
an emergency leave transfer program under which employees in any 
executive agency may donate unused annual leave for transfer to 
employees of the same or other agencies who were adversely affected by 
the bombings and who need additional time off for recovery. Workers' 
compensation benefits are available in the case of Federal employees who 
were injured or killed in the bombing, as are certain other benefits. I 
am further directing the Office of Personnel Management and the 
Department of Labor to provide additional information and assistance as 
appropriate.

                                                      William J. Clinton
