Remarks on the United Parcel Service Strike
August 17, 1997

    I have just had a conversation with Secretary Herman and with Bruce 
Lindsey. It's clear that they're making progress in the talks between 
UPS and the Teamsters, and I just want to urge them to redouble their 
efforts. This strike is beginning to hurt not only the company but its 
employees and the people who depend on it. And I think they ought to 
redouble their efforts to settle this strike, and they ought to do it 
today. And that's my encouragement to them. I'm pleased by the progress 
that's been

made, and I hope they'll just stay there and settle it today.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 1 p.m. on the South Lawn at 
the White House, prior to his departure for Block Island, Rhode Island. 
In his remarks he referred to Bruce Lindsay, Deputy Counsel to the 
President.
