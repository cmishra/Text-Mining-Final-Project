Nomination for Posts at the Treasury and Transportation Departments
March 22, 1993

    The President announced today his intention to nominate George 
Weise, the staff director of the House Ways and Means Committee's 
Subcommittee on Trade, to be Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service, 
Department of the Treasury; and Stephen Kaplan, the former city attorney 
of Denver, to be General Counsel for the Department of Transportation.
    ``George Weise,'' said the President, ``is one of this country's 
leading experts on customs matters, with experience that few can match. 
I am confident that he will work to make the Customs Service a model of 
effectiveness and efficiency.''
    ``As Denver's city attorney,'' the President added, ``Stephen Kaplan 
served Federico Pena with unparalleled dedication and professionalism. 
He will, I am sure, do no less here in the Federal Government.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
