Statement on Signing the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act
October 28, 2003

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 1474, the ``Check Clearing for the 
21st Century Act.'' This Act is intended to update and modernize the 
Nation's check payment and collection systems. Section 16(b) of the Act 
purports to require executive branch officials to submit to the Congress 
recommendations for legislative action. The executive branch shall 
construe section 16(b) in a manner consistent with the President's 
authority under the Recommendations Clause of the Constitution to submit 
for the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President 
shall judge necessary or expedient.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 October 28, 2003.

Note: H.R. 1474, approved October 28, was assigned Public Law No. 108-
100.
