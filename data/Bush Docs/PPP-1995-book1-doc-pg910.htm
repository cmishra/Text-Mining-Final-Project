Statement on House Action To Lift the Moratorium on Oil and Gas Drilling 
on the Outer Continental Shelf
June 20, 1995

    Today's vote by a House subcommittee to lift the moratorium on oil 
and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf would overturn a long-

the environment and economies of California, Florida, the Pacific 
Northwest, Alaska, and other coastal States.
    This action is a mistake, and I will have no part of it. I will not 
allow oil and gas drilling off our Nation's most sensitive coastlines on 
my watch. America's coastlines are simply too important to our economy 
and our way of life.
    This is yet another example of the zealous efforts of the Republican 
Congress to roll back environmental laws. Those laws serve the American 
people well, and I will fight to maintain them.
