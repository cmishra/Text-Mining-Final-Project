Remarks on Tobacco Marketing to Youth and an Exchange With Reporters
January 15, 1998



    The President. Before I leave for New York, I want to say a few 
words about the disturbing news that a major tobacco company appears to 
have targeted children to encourage them to begin smoking. For 5 years, 
we've done everything in our power to protect our children from the 
dangers of tobacco. I've called for strong bipartisan legislation to 
reduce smoking, especially by young people. The documents that came to 
light today show more than ever why it is absolutely imperative that 
Congress take action now to get tobacco companies out of the business of 
marketing cigarettes to children. Reducing teen smoking has always been 
America's bottom line, and that's this administration's bottom line; 
now, it should become the industry's bottom line.
    I'm confident that every Member of Congress, without regard to 
party, who reviews these documents will resolve to make 1998 the year 
that we actually pass comprehensive legislation to protect our children 
and the public health.
    Thank you.

Secretary of Labor Alexis M. Herman<Herman, Alexis M.<ls-thn-eq>

    Q. Mr. President, did Alexis Herman take money to peddle influence 
in your administration?
    The President. I don't believe that for a minute.

Situation in Iraq

    Q. What are you doing about Iraq to put teeth into the statement?

    The President. On Iraq, let me say that Mr. Butler<Butler, 
Richard<ls-thn-eq> is going back to Iraq with the strong support of the 
United Nations. I am very encouraged that even those who had been more 
sympathetic to Iraq saw through this totally unacceptable action. So now 
we have to see what happens. He ought to be given access. He's going 
back there; he's got the support of the U.N. We're going to watch this a 
day at a time and see what happens.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:20 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House prior to his departure for New York City.
