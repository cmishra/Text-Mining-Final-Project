Statement on the Tentative Settlement of the United Parcel Service 
Strike
August 19, 1997

    We have learned tonight that UPS and the Teamsters have reached a 
tentative settlement in their contract negotiations. I am pleased that 
the parties negotiated in good faith. Today's agreement represents their 
hard work and determination to reconcile their differences for the good 
of the company, its employees, and the customers they serve. The issues 
that were at the heart of their negotiations are important to our 
Nation's economic strength and to all Americans.
    I want to especially thank my Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman, who 
worked tirelessly with both sides to enable them to reach this tentative 
agreement.
