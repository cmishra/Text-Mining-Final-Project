White House Statement on the Posthumous Award of the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom to Arthur Ashe
June 22, 1993

    The President awarded a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
the Nation's highest civilian honor, to tennis great Arthur Ashe at the 
National Sports Awards ceremony at Constitution Hall Sunday night.
    Presenting the medal to Ashe's widow, Jeanne, the President noted 
that Ashe ``battled his way to the top rung of international tennis, and 
he did it with an inner strength and outward dignity that marked his 
game every bit as much as that dazzling crosscourt backhand.''
