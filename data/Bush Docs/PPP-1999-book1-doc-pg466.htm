Statement on a Serbian Proposal To Settle the Situation in Kosovo
March 30, 1999

    I share the view of Chancellor Schroeder<Schroeder, 
Gerhard> that President Milosevic's<Milosevic, 
Slobodan> proposal is unacceptable. President Milosevic began 
this brutal campaign. It is his responsibility to bring it to an 
immediate end and embrace a just peace. There is a strong consensus in 
NATO that we must press forward with our military action.
