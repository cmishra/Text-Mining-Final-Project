Statement on Secretary of Labor Alexis M. Herman<Herman, Alexis 
M.<ls-thn-eq>
May 11, 1998

    Secretary Herman has served me and this administration with 
distinction. She is a person of integrity, a dedicated public servant, 
and an asset to working families all over America. I know her well, and 
I am confident she will not be distracted from the important work she is 
doing. It is unfortunate that, despite no findings of wrongdoing by the 
Secretary, the Independent Counsel Act compels the Attorney 
General<Reno, Janet<ls-thn-eq> to recommend the appointment of an 
independent counsel in these circumstances. I look forward to the speedy 
resolution of this investigation. I am confident that in the end, 
investigators will also conclude that Ms. Herman did nothing wrong.
