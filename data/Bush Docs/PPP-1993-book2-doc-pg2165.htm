Message to President Arpad Goncz of Hungary on the Death of Prime 
Minister Jozsef Antall
December 13, 1993

Dear Mr. President:
    Please accept and convey to the Hungarian people my sincere 
condolences on the sad occasion of Prime Minister Antall's death. The 
Prime Minister's passing is a loss not only for Hungary but also for 
democratic nations around the world.
    As Hungary's first post-Communist Prime Minister, Mr. Antall will be 
remembered for his strong leadership and commitment to freedom during 
these historic times. He was a friend to the United States and an active 
partner in the international effort to deepen and secure democracy, 
stability and economic reform in Central and Eastern Europe. His loss 
will be greatly felt in Europe and here in the United States.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with Prime Minister Antall's family and 
the people of Hungary at this difficult time.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton
