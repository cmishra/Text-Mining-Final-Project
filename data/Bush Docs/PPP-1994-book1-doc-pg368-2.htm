Statement on Presentation of the Presidential Citizens Medal to 
Representative William H. Natcher
March 3, 1994

    Congressman Natcher has served the people of Kentucky and this 
Nation with distinction since 1941. He is revered by friends and 
opponents alike, and I can think of no person who deserves our 
recognition more. He represents the model of leadership to which we 
should all strive.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
that the President presented Representative Natcher with the medal at 
Bethesda Naval Hospital, Bethesda, MD.
