Nomination for Deputy Secretary of Defense
February 3, 1993

    The President today nominated William J. Perry, a highly respected 
expert on military technology, to serve as Deputy Secretary of Defense 
under Secretary Les Aspin.
    ``William Perry is a sound and sophisticated adviser whose expertise 
on military technology and policy is unmatched,'' said President 
Clinton. ``Secretary Aspin and I will rely heavily on his knowledge, 
imagination, and judgment as we work to keep our military the strongest 
in the world in a time of budgetary constraints.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
