Message on the Observance of Ramadan
September 21, 2006

    I send greetings to the many Muslims observing Ramadan in America 
and around the world.
    Ramadan is the holiest time of the Muslim year and an important 
holiday when Muslims take time for prayer, fasting, and personal 
sacrifice. According to Islamic teachings, this month represents when 
God delivered His word to the prophet Muhammad in the form of the 
Qur'an. Ramadan is also an opportunity to gather with friends and family 
and show thanks for God's blessings through works of charity.
    Ramadan and the upcoming holiday seasons are a good time to remember 
the common values that bind us together. Our society is enriched by our 
Muslim citizens whose commitment to faith reminds us of the gift of 
religious freedom in our country.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a 
blessed Ramadan. Ramadan Mubarak.

                                                          George W. Bush
