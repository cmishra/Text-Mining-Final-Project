Statement on the Iraq Donors' Conference
October 24, 2003

    Today's success at the Iraq Donors' Conference marked significant 
progress for freedom in Iraq. I commend the 73 nations and 20 
international organizations that are meeting the challenge of helping 
the Iraqi people recover from decades of oppression and build a better 
future. The contributions will help bring necessary funds, goods, and 
services to the Iraqi people. I especially thank President Aznar<Aznar, 
Jose Maria<ls-thn-eq> and the Government of Spain for having hosted the 
conference and for having contributed so much to supporting the people 
of Iraq.
    The world has a clear interest in a democratic Iraq because free 
nations do not breed the ideologies of terror. A free Iraq will serve as 
an example and an inspiration to advocates of reform and progress 
throughout the Middle East. And a free Iraq will be a source of 
stability and hope for that region. America appreciates the efforts of 
all nations that are committed to this great endeavor.
