Letter to Congressional Leaders on Extending Generalized System of 
Preferences Benefits to the Republic of Georgia
June 29, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Pursuant to section 502(f) of the Trade Act of l974, as amended (the 
``Act''), I am writing to notify you of my intent to add the Republic of 
Georgia to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the 
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-
free access to the U.S. market for a wide range of products from 
beneficiary developing countries.
    I have considered the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502 of 
the Act and have determined that it is appropriate to extend GSP 
benefits to Georgia.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The related proclamation of June 29 is listed in Appendix D at 
the end of this volume.
