Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Colombia
February 8, 2003

    Last night, terrorists attacked a nightclub in Bogota, Colombia. The 
latest reports are that 25 innocent men and women were killed and more 
than 150 wounded.
    On behalf of the United States, I condemn this barbaric act of 
terrorism. I offer our deepest condolences to the Colombian families and 
friends of all who were murdered. We also hope and pray for the quick 
recovery of those that were injured.
    I extend to President Uribe<Uribe, Alvaro> and the people 
of Colombia our deepest sympathy for this horrible tragedy.
    We stand with the Colombian people in their fight against 
narcoterrorists who threaten their democratic way of life.
    We will offer all appropriate assistance to the Colombian Government 
in bringing to justice the murderers responsible for this act.
