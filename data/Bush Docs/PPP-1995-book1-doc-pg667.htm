Russia-United States Joint Statement on Missile Systems
May 10, 1995

    The President of the United States of America and the President of 
the Russian Federation, taking into account the threat posed by 
worldwide proliferation of missiles and missile technology and the 
necessity of counteracting this threat, agreed on the following basic 
principles to serve as a basis for further discussions in order to reach 
agreement in the field of demarcation between ABM systems and theater 
missile defense systems.
    The United States and Russia are each committed to the ABM Treaty, a 
cornerstone of strategic stability.
    Both sides must have the option to establish and to deploy effective 
theater missile defense systems. Such activity must not lead to 
violation or circumvention of the ABM Treaty.
    Theater missile defense systems may be deployed by each side which 
(1) will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force

of the other side and (2) will not be tested to give such systems that 
capability.
    Theater missile defense systems will not be deployed by the sides 
for use against each other.
    The scale of deployment--in number and geographic scope--of theater 
missile defense systems by either side will be consistent with theater 
ballistic missile programs confronting that side.
    In the spirit of partnership, the Presidents undertook to promote 
reciprocal openness in activities of the sides in theater missile 
defense systems and in the exchange of corresponding information.
