Statement on the Death of Grover Washington, Jr.<Washington, Grover, 
Jr.>
December 18, 1999

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Grover 
Washington, Jr., one of America's greatest musicians. I will always be 
grateful for the honor of playing saxophone with Grover back in 1993, 
after a White House jazz concert, and for the wonderful music he 
performed at my Inaugural celebrations and my 50th birthday celebration. 
Grover Washington was as versatile as any jazz musician in America, 
moving with ease and fluency from vintage jazz to funk, and from gospel 
to blues to pop. ``I want to be able to visit any genre,'' he once said, 
``and converse there with my horn.'' Grover Washington did exactly that, 
and beautifully. I will miss both the man and his music. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with his wife, Christine,<Washington, 
Christine> and their two children, Grover III<Washington, 
Grover, III> and Shana.<Washington, Shana>
