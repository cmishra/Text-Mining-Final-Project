Middle East Peace Summit

    Q. Mr. President, are you more optimistic today about the prospects 
for a Middle East peace settlement?
    The President. All I can tell you is that they're still talking, and 
consistent with our rules, I'm still not talking. [Laughter] But I'm 
hopeful.

National Missile Defense System

    Q. Mr. President, are the two of you going to be talking about 
missile defense here today?
    The President. I'm sure we will. We talked about it last month in 
Moscow, and I'm sure we'll talk about it.
