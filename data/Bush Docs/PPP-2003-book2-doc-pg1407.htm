Remarks at the Iftaar Dinner
October 28, 2003

    Good evening. Ramadan Kareem. Welcome to the White House. I'm 
pleased to host all of you, our distinguished guests, during this 
blessed month of Ramadan.

    For Muslims in America and around the world, this holy time is set 
aside for prayer and fasting. It is also a good time for people of all 
faiths to reflect on the values we hold common--love of family, 
gratitude to God, and a commitment to religious freedom. America is a 
land of many faiths, and we honor and welcome and value the Muslim 
faith.
    I appreciate Secretary Powell<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> being here 
today, the great Secretary of State of America. There are members of my 
administration scattered amongst you, and I appreciate them coming. I 
particularly want to thank the Secretary of Energy, Spence 
Abraham,<Abraham, Spencer<ls-thn-eq> for being here as well.
    I appreciate Your Highness Sheik Hamdan bin Zayid,<Nahayyan, Hamdan, 
bin Zayid Al<ls-thn-eq> the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State 
for Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates, for coming. I want to 
thank all the Ambassadors who are here and representatives of the 
members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. We're honored 
you're here tonight. I want to thank the American Muslim leaders who are 
here with us today. I appreciate my friends coming. I particularly want 
to thank Imam Faizul Khan,<Khan, Faizul<ls-thn-eq> who will lead us in 
prayer.
    According to the teachings of Islam, Ramadan commemorates the 
revelation of God's word in the Holy Koran to the Prophet Mohammed. In 
this season, Muslims come together to remember their dependence on God 
and to show charity to their neighbors. Fasting during Ramadan helps 
Muslims focus on God's greatness, to grow in virtue, and cultivate 
compassion toward those who live in poverty and hunger.
    The charity, discipline, and sacrifice practiced during Ramadan in 
America makes America a better, more compassionate country. The family 
gatherings that break the fast at the end of each day enrich our 
communities. And the heartfelt prayers offered at this time of year are 
a blessing in many lives, and they're a blessing to our Nation.
    As we gather during this season, we are mindful of the struggles of 
the men and women around the world who long for the same peace and 
tolerance we enjoy here in America. Brave American and coalition troops 
are laboring every day to defend our liberty and to spread freedom and 
peace, particularly to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan.
    The citizens of those countries have survived decades of tyranny and 
fear. Now, new leaders are emerging. They're emerging in Iraq in the 
form of medical workers and teachers and citizens of all backgrounds who 
are coming together to guide their country's future. They're moving 
toward self-government and practicing their faith as they see fit.
    We will continue to support the people of Iraq and Afghanistan as 
they build a more hopeful future. And we will not allow criminals or 
terrorists to stop the advance of freedom. Terrorists who use religion 
to justify the taking of innocent life have no home in any faith.
    As we defend liberty and justice abroad, we must always honor those 
values here at home. America rejects all forms of ethnic and religious 
bigotry. We welcome the values of every responsible citizen, no matter 
the land of their birth. And we will always protect the most basic human 
freedom, the freedom to worship God without fear.
    Islam is a religion that brings hope and comfort to good people 
across America and around the world. Tonight we honor the contributions 
of Muslims and the tradition of Islam by hosting this Iftaar dinner at 
the White House.
    I wish you all a very blessed Ramadan, and may God bless.

Note: The President spoke at 5:50 p.m. on the State Floor at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Imam Faizul Khan, Islamic Center 
of the Washington Area.
