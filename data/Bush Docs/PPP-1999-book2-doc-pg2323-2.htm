Statement on the Death of C. Vann Woodward<Woodward, C. Vann>
December 19, 1999

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened by the passing of C. Vann 
Woodward, one of the most important and influential historians of our 
time. A native of Arkansas, Woodward not only wrote about history; he 
helped shape it. From living through and witnessing the era of Jim Crow 
to marching on Selma for racial justice, he brought a unique perspective 
to the teaching and analysis of Southern history. While in the eyes of 
most he will best be remembered for his many books, his Pulitzer prize, 
and his long and distinguished teaching career, I believe his greatest 
gift was his tenacious pursuit of the truth and his warm and generous 
spirit. Dr. King once called one of Woodward's books the historical 
bible of the civil rights movement. His work influenced generations of 
Southern historians and social activists and had a major impact

on my own thinking. All Americans should look to the life and work of C. 
Vann Woodward, as we rededicate ourselves to building one America in the 
21st century. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.
