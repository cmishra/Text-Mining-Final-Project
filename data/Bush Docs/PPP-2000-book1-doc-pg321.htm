Statement on the Report of the Interagency Task Force on the
United States Coast Guard Roles and Missions
February 25, 2000

    I am pleased to receive the report of the Interagency Task Force on 
the U.S. Coast Guard Roles and Missions. I extend my sincere 
appreciation to Chairman Mortimer Downey<Downey, Mortimer L.<ls-thn-eq> 
and the 15 other members who provided advice as to the appropriate 
future roles and missions for our Coast Guard. I also would like to 
commend the leadership of Secretary Rodney Slater<Slater, Rodney 
E.<ls-thn-eq> and the Department of Transportation for their vision and 
vigilance in maintaining safety--my administration's highest 
transportation priority.
    As we have witnessed time and again, and most recently with the 
tragic loss of Alaska Air Flight 261, the Coast Guard provides America 
with a maritime military and a multimission presence that is flexible 
and adaptable.
    The Coast Guard will continue to safeguard America's maritime safety 
and security. I look forward to working with the Congress to ensure that 
the world's best Coast Guard remains as its motto proclaims: Semper 
Paratus--Always Ready.
