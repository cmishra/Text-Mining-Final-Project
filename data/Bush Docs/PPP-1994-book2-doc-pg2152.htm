Statement on Webster L. Hubbell
December 6, 1994

    Webb Hubbell is an old friend, and Hillary and I were saddened by 
today's events. We should also remember that Webb is a man who has given 
much to his family, his community, and his country. The matter is in the 
hands of the court, and I don't think it would be appropriate to say 
anything more at this time.

Note: Former Associate Attorney General Webster L. Hubbell pleaded 
guilty to mail fraud and tax evasion charges on December 6.
