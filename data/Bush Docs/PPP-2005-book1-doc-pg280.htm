Joint Statement by President George W. Bush and President Jacques 
Chirac:<Chirac, Jacques<ls-thn-eq> Lebanon
February 21, 2005

    The United States and France join with the European Union and the 
international community in condemning the assassination of former 
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri, and in their support for a free, 
independent, and democratic Lebanon. We support the U.N. investigation 
into this terrorist act and urge the full cooperation of all parties in 
order to identify those responsible for this act.

    We urge full and immediate implementation of UNSCR 1559 in all its 
aspects, including its call for a sovereign, independent, and democratic 
Lebanon as well as for the consolidation of security under the authority 
of a Lebanese government free from foreign domination.
    Lebanon's forthcoming parliamentary elections can mark another 
milestone in Lebanon's return to independence and democracy if they are 
free and fair, conducted without outside interference, and guaranteed by 
international observers. The implementation of UNSCR 1559 is essential 
to the organization and success of these elections. The people of 
Lebanon deserve this opportunity, and we stand with them in their 
aspirations for freedom, sovereignty, and security.
