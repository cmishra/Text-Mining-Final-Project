Statement on Senate Action To Reauthorize PATRIOT Act Reauthorization 
Legislation
December 21, 2005

    I appreciate the Senate for working to keep the existing PATRIOT Act 
in law through next July, despite boasts last week by the Democratic 
leader<Reid, Harry<ls-thn-eq> that he had blocked the act. No one should 
be allowed

to block the PATRIOT Act to score political points, and I am grateful 
the Senate rejected that approach. The terrorists want to attack our 
country again and inflict even greater damage than they did on September 
11, 2001. The PATRIOT Act is a vital tool for America in the war on 
terror. The act has torn down the wall between law enforcement and 
intelligence officials to help us connect the dots and prevent attacks. 
The work of Congress on the PATRIOT Act is not finished. The act will 
expire next summer, but the terrorist threat to America will not expire 
on that schedule. I look forward to continuing to work with Congress to 
reauthorize the PATRIOT Act.
