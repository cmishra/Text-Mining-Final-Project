Exchange With Reporters in Jerusalem
October 28, 1994

Holocaust Memorial

    Q. Mr. President, Voice of Israel, live--a word if I may. What did 
you put in writing in the guestbook, sir? May I bother you to approach 
the mike, sir, please?
    The President. I wrote that today we are one step closer to the time 
when the people of Israel can live together in peace with all of your 
neighbors, the time when people of Israel will never again suffer death 
and destruction--the events that are memorialized here--simply because 
of their race or their faith, and may God let it come to pass.

President's Visit

    Q. Mr. President, how would you summarize your visit in Israel?
    The President. It was a wonderful visit. I was deeply touched by the 
reception of the people, grateful for the opportunity to address the 
Knesset. I leave redoubled in the support of the American people for the 
people of Israel

and redoubled in my determination to continue until we have a 
comprehensive peace.
    Q. What will be your message to your troops in Kuwait, sir?
    The President. I'm very proud of them.

Note: The President spoke at 8:49 a.m. at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust 
Memorial. A tape was not available for verification of the content of
