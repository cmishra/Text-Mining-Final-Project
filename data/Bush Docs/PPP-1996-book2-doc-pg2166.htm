Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on
Budget Deferrals
December 4, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report seven new deferrals of budgetary 
resources, totaling $3.5 billion.
    These deferrals affect programs of the Department of State, the 
Social Security Administration, and International Security Assistance.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on December 5. 
The report detailing the deferrals was published in the Federal Register 
on December 16.
