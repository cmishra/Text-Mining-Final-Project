April 16, 2008

    His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI<Pope Benedict XVI<ls-thn-eq> and 
President George W. Bush met today in the Oval Office of the White 
House.
    President Bush, on behalf of all Americans, welcomed the Holy 
Father,<Pope Benedict XVI<ls-thn-eq> wished him a happy birthday, and 
thanked him for the spiritual and moral guidance, which he offers to the 
whole human family. The President wished the Pope every success in his 
Apostolic Journey and in his address at the United Nations, and 
expressed appreciation for the Pope's upcoming visit to ``Ground Zero'' 
in New York.
    During their meeting, the Holy Father<Pope Benedict XVI<ls-thn-eq> 
and the President discussed a number of topics of common interest to the 
Holy Seeand the United States of America, including moral and religious 
considerations to which both parties are committed: the respect of the 
dignity of the human person; the defense and promotion of life, 
matrimony and the family; the education of future generations; human 
rights and religious freedom; sustainable development and the struggle 
against poverty and pandemics, especially in Africa. In regard to the

financial contributions in this area. The two reaffirmed their total 
rejection of terrorism as well as the manipulation of religion to 
justify immoral and violent acts against innocents. They further touched

the need to confront terrorism with appropriate means that respect the 
human person and his or her rights.
    The Holy Father<Pope Benedict XVI<ls-thn-eq> and the President 
devoted considerable time in their discussions to the Middle East, in 
particular resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict in line with the 
vision of two states living side-by-side in peace and security, their 
mutual support for the sovereignty and independence of Lebanon, and 
their common concern for the situation in Iraq and particularly the 
precarious state of Christian communities there and elsewhere in the 
region. The Holy Father and the President expressed hope for an end to 
violence and for a prompt and comprehensive solution to the crises which 
afflict the region.
    The Holy Father<Pope Benedict XVI<ls-thn-eq> and the President also 
considered the situation in Latin America with reference, among other 
matters, to immigrants, and the need for a coordinated policy regarding 
immigration, especially their humane treatment and the well being of 
their families.
