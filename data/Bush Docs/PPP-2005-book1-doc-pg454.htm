Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Legislation Funding the 
War on Terror
March 16, 2005

    I applaud the House of Representatives for its strong bipartisan 
support for our troops and for our strategy to win the war on terror. 
The people of Iraq and Afghanistan are building new democracies and 
defying the terrorists, and America is standing with them. Both 
countries are assuming greater responsibility for their own security, 
which will help our troops return home as quickly as possible with the 
honor they have earned.

    I thank the House for its quick action and look forward to working 
with the Senate so that all of my top priorities are included in the 
final legislation.
