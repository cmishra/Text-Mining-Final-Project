Memorandum on Assistance to Federal Employees Affected by Hurricane 
Katrina
September 1, 2005

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Assistance to Federal Employees Affected by Hurricane Katrina

    I have directed the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to 
establish an emergency leave transfer program to assist employees 
affected by Hurricane Katrina. The emergency leave transfer program will 
permit employees in an executive agency to donate unused annual leave 
for transfer to employees of the same or other agencies who have been 
adversely affected by Hurricane Katrina and who need additional time off 
from work without having to use their own paid leave.

                                                          George W. Bush
