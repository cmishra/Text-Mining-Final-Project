Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister Tony 
Blair<Blair, Tony<ls-thn-eq> of the United Kingdom at Camp David, 
Maryland
February 23, 2001

    Q. How is it going so far?
    President Bush. Pretty darn good.
    Q. How was lunch? Is it true that Churchill once came to this cabin?
    President Bush. That's exactly right.
    Q. How goes the get-acquainted session?
    President Bush. Good, John [John Roberts, CBS News], thank you. 
``Ambassador'' Johndroe<Johndroe, Gordon<ls-thn-eq> was telling us where 
to go.
    Q. Sir, can you tell us the historical significance of where you're 
standing?
    President Bush. This is where Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the 
first visitor to Camp David, stayed. It's a huge honor for Laura and me 
to welcome the current Prime Minister and his wife.<Blair, 
Cherie<ls-thn-eq> And we're about to have a press availability to answer 
all these difficult questions that you're throwing at us, John. I 
promised the Prime Minister that you in particular would behave well 
during the press conference--and Fournier [Ron Fournier, Associated 
Press].
    All right, we're actually now going to go for a walk of a couple 
miles.
    Q. Mr. Prime Minister, where's your coat?
    Prime Minister Blair. It's around somewhere, but actually it's a lot 
warmer than Canada.
    President Bush. You shouldn't have noticed that.

Note: The exchange began at 3:23 p.m. on the porch of Holly Lodge. In 
his remarks, the President referred to Assistant Press Secretary Gordon 
Johndroe and Prime Minister Blair's wife, Cherie. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of this exchange.
