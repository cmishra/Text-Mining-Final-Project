Statement on Welfare Reform Initiatives in Delaware
May 8, 1995

    Today my administration has approved a bold plan for welfare reform 
in Delaware that promotes work, requires parental responsibility, and 
protects children. Delaware is the 28th State welfare reform experiment 
to be freed from Federal rules and regulations under this 
administration. Under Governor Tom Carper's leadership, Delaware will 
impose a time limit on benefits, provide job training opportunities, 
increase child support enforcement, and require teenage mothers to live 
at home and stay in school.
    In particular, I am pleased that Delaware joins 14 other States in 
requiring welfare recipients to sign personal responsibility agreements, 
which is a contract for work, in order to receive assistance. These 
contracts were an important part of the welfare reform legislation I 
sent Congress last year and are essential to real reform that moves 
people from welfare to work. Per-


[[Page 658]]

sonal responsibility is at the heart of welfare reform, and personal 
responsibility contracts must be part of any national welfare reform 
plan.
    I will continue to work with Congress to enact welfare reform 
legislation that includes real work requirements and the incentives and 
resources for States to move people from welfare to work. Welfare reform 
must be tough on work and on parents who walk away from their 
responsibilities, not tough on children.
