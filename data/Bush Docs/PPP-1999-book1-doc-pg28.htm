Statement on the Decision of Housing and Urban Development Secretary 
Andrew M. Cuomo<Cuomo, Andrew M.> Not To Seek Election to the 
Senate
January 8, 1999

    Earlier today Secretary Cuomo announced that he would not run for 
the United States Senate. I told Secretary Cuomo that I would support 
his decision either way, but on a personal level, I am glad that he is 
staying to build on HUD's new empowerment agenda. New Yorkers should be 
proud of the job he is doing. Andrew believes that his job at HUD is not 
finished. Therefore, he has chosen to continue his public service at the 
Department, and I applaud his decision.
