Memorandum on the Amendment to the United Kingdom-United States Atomic 
Energy Agreement
May 23, 1994

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy

Subject: Proposed Amendment to the United States/United Kingdom 
Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual 
Defense Purposes

    I have reviewed and concur in the positions taken in your joint 
letter to me of May 14, 1994, recommending approval of a proposed 
amendment to the Agreement Between the Government of the United States 
of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual 
Defense Purposes. I note from your joint recommendation and concur with 
your view that the United Kingdom is participating with the United 
States pursuant to an international agreement by substantial and 
material contributions to the mutual defense and security. The proposed 
Amendment will permit cooperation that will further improve our mutual 
defense posture and support our interests under the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. I hereby:
    --approve the proposed Amendment to the 1958 Agreement;
    --determine that performance under the proposed Amendment will 
        promote and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to the 
        common defense and security;
    --approve the program outlined in this Amendment and determine that 
        such program will promote and will not constitute an 
        unreasonable risk to the common defense and security; and
    --authorize the execution of the proposed Amendment for the 
        Government of the United States in a manner specified by the 
        Secretary of State.

                                                      William J. Clinton
