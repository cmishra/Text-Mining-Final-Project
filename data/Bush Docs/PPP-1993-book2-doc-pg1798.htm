Message to the Senate Transmitting the Slovak Republic-United States 
Taxation Convention
October 21, 1993

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the United States of America and the Slovak 
Republic for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of 
Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, signed at 
Bratislava on October 8, 1993. Also transmitted for the information of 
the Senate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the 
Convention.
    The Convention will be the first income tax convention between the 
two countries. It is intended it reduce the distortions (double taxation 
or excessive taxation) that can arise when two countries tax the same 
income. It will modernize tax relations between the two countries and 
will facilitate greater private sector U.S. investment in the Slovak 
Republic.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
October 21, 1993.
