Statement on the Death of Margaret Truman Daniel<Daniel, Margaret 
Truman<ls-thn-eq>
January 29, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by the death of 
Margaret Truman Daniel. The only child of our 33d President, she 
supported her father as he confronted the difficult challenges of his 
Presidency, witnessing firsthand the leadership of Harry Truman in both 
war and peace. An accomplished author and singer, her life was one of 
tremendous personal achievement. Our thoughts and prayers are with 
Margaret Truman Daniel's<Daniel, Clifton Truman<ls-thn-eq> sons<Daniel, 
Harrison Gates<ls-thn-eq> and<Daniel, Thomas Washington<ls-thn-eq> the 
rest of the Truman family.

Note: The statement referred to Clifton T. Daniel, Harrison G. Daniel, 
and Thomas W. Daniel, sons of Mrs. Daniel.
