Exchange With Reporters in Santa Fe, New Mexico
May 11, 2003

President's Golf Game/President's Schedule

    Q. How's the game?
    The President. I need a lot of work.
    Q. Better than yesterday?
    The President. Equally as feeble--equally as feeble.
    It's been a fabulous weekend here in Santa Fe. I'm now ready to get 
back to work. Got some travel to do tomorrow; be talking to the country 
about the need for an economic stimulus package. And then we're going to 
go see, Tuesday afternoon, we're going to go to see some of the tornado 
sites. And it will give me a chance to tell the people who've suffered 
great loss how much a lot of the Nation prays for them and how we're 
concerned about them. But it's been a fabulous experience here in a 
wonderful part of the world. The hospitality by the people here has been 
just great. I really appreciate it.
    Happy Mother's Day, everybody.

Note: The exchange began at 5:45 p.m. at the golf course at Las 
Campanas.
