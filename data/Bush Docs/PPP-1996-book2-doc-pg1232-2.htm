Letter to Members of Congress on Proposed Safe Drinking Water 
Legislation
July 30, 1996

Dear __________:
    I urge the Congress to pass strong legislation that protects our 
nation's drinking water. Although the conferees have made considerable 
progress, it is imperative that I sign this legislation into law by 
August 1. If the House and Senate fail to act, $725 million in federal 
funding will cease to be available for this important health and safety 
initiative.
    All Americans have the right to know that their drinking water is 
safe. This legislation should solidify that right by strengthening 
health and safety standards in addition to protecting the public from 
significant threats to our drinking water. It is critical that the 
Congress approve legislation that provides both a reasonable framework 
to improve our nation's water supply in addition to the funding and 
flexibility necessary for communities to make these improvements a 
reality.
    A compromise bill containing these priorities is clearly within 
reach. I hope that we seize this opportunity and pass this important 
piece of legislation.
    Sincerely,

                                                                    Bill

Note: Identical letters were sent to congressional conferees meeting to 
consider S. 1316.
