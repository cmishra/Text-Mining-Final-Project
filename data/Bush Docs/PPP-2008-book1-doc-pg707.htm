Remarks on the Earthquake in China
May 20, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I have come to the Chinese Embassy. 
Mr. Ambassador,<Zhou Wenzhong<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much. Madam,<Xie 
Shumin<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much. We've come to express our 
country's condolences for those who mourn for the loved ones.
    We stand ready to help in any way that the Chinese Government would 
like. We know there's great courage being displayed, Mr. 
Ambassador,<Zhou Wenzhong<ls-thn-eq> as rescue workers search for those 
who may still be living.
    This natural disaster is very hard on many of your people, and we 
understand that. And we extend our deepest sympathies and pray for 
recovery and pray for the strength of those who are--whose lives have 
been torn apart during this terrible tragedy.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:13 a.m. at the Embassy of China. In his 
remarks, he referred to China's Ambassador to the U.S. Zhou Wenzhong and 
his wife Xie Shumin.
