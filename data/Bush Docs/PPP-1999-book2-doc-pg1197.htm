Statement on the Surrender of the <Maturino Resendiz, Angel (Rafael 
Resendez-Ramirez)>Suspected ``Railway<Resendez-Ramirez, Rafael 
(Angel Maturino Resendiz)> Killer''
July 13, 1999

    I want to thank all of the State, local, and Federal law enforcement 
officials whose hard work led to the surrender of the suspected 
``railway killer'' earlier today. As a result of their determined 
efforts and the cooperation of Mexican authorities, the suspect is now 
in custody in the United States. All Americans can rest easier knowing 
that law enforcement authorities will bring the full force of the law to 
bear in this case.
