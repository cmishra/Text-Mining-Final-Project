Message to the Congress Reporting Budget Rescissions
February 6, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report 23 rescission proposals of budgetary 
resources, totaling $1.1 billion. These rescissions, when combined with 
other discretionary savings proposals contained in the FY 1996 Budget, 
will reduce FY 1995 budgetary resources by $2.4 billion.
    The proposed rescissions affect the Departments of Agriculture, 
Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban 
Development, Labor, and Transportation; the Environmental Protection 
Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the Small 
Business Administration; the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation 
Board; and the National Science Foundation.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 6, 1995.

Note: The report detailing the proposed rescissions was published in the 
Federal Register on February 15.
