Exchange With Reporters in Waco, Texas
August 23, 2001

President's Schedule

    The President. Good morning. I'll see you all at the school.
    Q. Uh-oh, what does that mean?
    The President. In Crawford.
    Q. For what?
    Q. You're going to drop by?
    The President. I'm going to drop by the school after, so we'll have 
a little chance to visit then, to thank them for letting you all stay at 
the elementary school. Obviously, nobody told you.
    Q. Thanks for the heads up.
    The President. We're going to have an impromptu stop. I will decide 
on my way home to stop by the school. [Laughter]
    Roland Betts,<Betts, Roland> my good friend from New York 
City.
    Let's go. Hit them up.
    And we'll--we can have a little visit there, if you like. That way, 
it won't ruin my golf game. [Laughter]
    Q. Looking forward to your game?
    The President. Yes, I'm looking forward to getting out here.
    Had a nice visit with Mitch Daniels<Daniels, Mitchell, 
Jr.> this morning.
    Q. He down here?
    The President. No, I called him.
    Q. Is that a Masters souvenir, your glove?
    The President. I think somebody must have sent me that. I haven't 
been there in a while. Beautiful course.
    All right, excuse me.

[At this point, the President played a round of golf.]

President's Round of Golf

    The President. So, I won't be a professional golfer.
    Q. I'm going to go find that ball. I'm going to find that one.
    The President. The first one? If you can find that first one, you're 
a pretty good bird-dog. [Laughter]
    Is everybody enjoying themselves here?
    Q. I only just got here, so----
    The President. Yes, I know. Where have you been?

    Q. Sucking up the salt air on the west coast.
    The President. Brie and cheese?
    Q. No, tennis.
    The President. Okay.
