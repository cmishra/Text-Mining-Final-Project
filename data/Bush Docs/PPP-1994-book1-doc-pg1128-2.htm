Statement on Assistance to California
June 23, 1994

    As earthquake recovery efforts have continued, the President's 
contingency fund has enabled our administration to respond to unforeseen 
problems. Most of the funds I am releasing today will help small 
business people in southern California who have had difficulty obtaining 
assistance until now.

Note: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary 
announcing additional assistance to California.
