    Thank you all for coming. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are 
really honored to be back in Mississippi with the Governor<Barbour, 
Haley<ls-thn-eq> and the first lady.<Barbour, Marsha<ls-thn-eq> And most 
of all, we're pleased to be with those who are helping to educate the 
young here on the gulf coast.

part of the country rebuild. Part of rebuilding the community is to make 
sure that the schools are able to function well and teach children how 
to read and write and add and subtract. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and 
I are committed to making sure no child is left behind anywhere in the 
United States of America.
    Particularly want to thank the superintendent,<Rodolfich, Wayne 
V.<ls-thn-eq> the principal,<Ros, Suzanne<ls-thn-eq> and the teachers 
for helping this important part of the country recover from devastating 
storm.

make an announcement.
