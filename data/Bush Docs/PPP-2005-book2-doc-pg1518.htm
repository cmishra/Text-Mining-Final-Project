Message on the Observance of Ramadan
October 4, 2005

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send warm greetings to Muslims in 
the United States and throughout the world as they begin the observance 
of Ramadan.
    The month of Ramadan, which commemorates the revelation of the 
Qur'an to the prophet Muhammed, is the holiest month of the Muslim year. 
It is a special time of reflection, fasting, and charity. It is also a 
time of spiritual growth and prayer and an occasion to remember the less 
fortunate by sharing God's gifts with those in need.
    Throughout our history, America has been blessed by the 
contributions of people of many different faiths. Our Muslim citizens 
have helped make our Nation a stronger and more hopeful place through 
their faith, generosity, and compassion.
    May this be a blessed Ramadan for Muslims in the United States and 
around the world. Ramadan mubarak.

                                                          George W. Bush
