Remarks on the Return of the Space Shuttle Endeavour Astronauts in 
Houston
January 20, 1996

    Ladies and gentlemen, I am so glad that I happened to be in Houston 
and at the airport at the right time. I just want to take a minute--I 
know you came to see this fine crew and their families and to celebrate 
with them--but I just want to say on behalf of the people of the United 
States, we are very proud of this mission, proud of this crew. We were 
thrilled

by its success, and we're glad to have them home.
    And let me just make one plug to--I know that I'm preaching to the 
saved here, but I want to make one plug for the space program. You see 
all of our friends and allies from Japan here celebrating their 
participation in the person--where is he?--of Mr. Wakata. We thank him.
    Our space program is an important part of our partnership for world 
peace. It is an important part of how we relate to and work with the 
Japanese, the Russians, and others in building a more cooperative, safer 
world for the 21st century. Our space program is also an important part 
of research we do in trying to solve medical mysteries and environmental 
mysteries. NASA has been a major, major force in helping us to figure 
out ways to save our planet Earth as we accommodate more population 
growth and more economic growth. So I ask all of you, remain steadfast 
in your support for America's investment in space and in our future 
together with our friends and allies throughout the world.
    Thank you. God bless you.
    Welcome home, gentlemen. Job well done.

Note: The President spoke at 1:20 p.m. at Ellington Field. In his 
remarks, he referred to Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of these remarks.
