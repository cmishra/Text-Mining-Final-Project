Message to the Senate Transmitting the Philippines-United States 
Extradition Treaty
September 5, 1995

To the Senate of the United States:

    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Republic of the Philippines, signed at Manila on November 13, 1994.

    In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.

    Together with the Treaty Between the Government of the United States 
of America and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines on 
Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, also signed November 13, 
1994, this Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation 
between the law enforcement communities of both countries. It will 
thereby make a significant contribution to international law enforcement 
efforts.

    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.

    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

September 5, 1995.
