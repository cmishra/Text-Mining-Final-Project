Statement on the Death of Bob Stump<Stump, Bob> 
June 24, 2003

    Congressman Bob Stump lived a distinguished life of service as a 
World War II veteran, an Arizona State legislator, and a United States 
Congressman. He was a gifted leader who remained true to his principles 
and made an indelible mark on those who were fortunate enough to know 
him. As one of the few Members of Congress who served as chairman of 
both the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Armed Services 
Committee, he was admired for his tireless efforts on behalf of the men 
and women in uniform. Laura<Bush, Laura> joins me in sending 
our thoughts and prayers to Nancy<Stump, Nancy> and the entire 
Stump family during this difficult time.
