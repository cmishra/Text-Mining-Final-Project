Statement on the Death of King Birenda<King Birenda<ls-thn-eq> of Nepal
June 2, 2001

    I am deeply saddened and shocked at King Birenda's untimely death. I 
also mourn the loss of Queen Aiswarya<Queen Aiswarya<ls-thn-eq> and 
other family members and extend my deepest sympathies to the King's 
extended family. I send my condolences to the Nepalese people during 
this difficult period. Our prayers are with the Government and people of 
Nepal.
