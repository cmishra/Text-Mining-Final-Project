Remarks During a Tour of the Border and an Exchange With Reporters in 
Yuma, Arizona
April 9, 2007

    The President. You know, it's interesting, this is the spot I came 
to in May of 2006. Colburn<Colburn, Ronald S.<ls-thn-eq> told me then 
that we were in the process of developing a modernization strategy. None 
of this existed prior to my arrival in May. And they told me they were 
developing a strategy that would prevent people from charging across to 
try to get to the neighborhood over here, and that strategy has been 
implemented.
    It is a combination of roads, lighting, and fencing, all aiming at 
making sure that we have a border that's protected. And it's amazing the 
progress that's been made. And we have come back to this spot because 
it's where I was the last time. And I was most impressed by your 
strategy, even more impressed by the fact that it's now being 
implemented. And the men have reported that the number of arrests are 
down, which is an indication that fewer people are trying to cross the 
border at this part of--along the border. And so we're making some 
pretty good progress.
    And the reason we've come here is to show the American people that 
the plan that we've announced is now being implemented. And there is 
still more work to be done, but nevertheless, a lot of progress is being 
made. I'm going to talk a little bit later about making sure that we 
complete the strategy by having a comprehensive immigration bill. I will 
save my words until then. But in the meantime, I wanted

you to see the progress--see firsthand the progress that we're making 
here on the border.
    Anyway, thank you for your time.

    Q. What most impresses you, Mr. President?
    The President. The hard work being done.

Patrol. In his remarks, he referred to Ronald S. Colburn, chief patrol

Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of these remarks.
