Message to the Congress on Trade With Belarus and Uzbekistan
August 17, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:
    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Belarus and 
Uzbekistan to the list of beneficiary developing countries under the 
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP program offers duty-
free access to the U.S. market and is authorized by the Trade Act of 
1974.
    I have carefully considered the criteria identified in sections 501 
and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974. In light of these criteria, and 
particularly the level of development and initiation of economic reforms 
in Belarus and Uzbekistan, I have determined that it is appropriate to 
extend GSP benefits to these two countries.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(1) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
August 17, 1994.

Note: The related proclamation is listed in Appendix D at the end of 
this volume.
