Statement on Proposed Legislation To Provide Protections Against Genetic 
Discrimination
March 6, 2002

    I applaud Senators Snowe, Frist, and Jeffords<Snowe, Olympia 
J.> for<Frist, Bill> introducing<Jeffords, James 
M.> their bill today to prohibit discrimination in health 
insurance and employment based solely on an individual's genetic 
predisposition to a future disease. The bill provides strong protections 
against genetic discrimination that are fair, reasonable, and consistent 
with existing laws. I look forward to working with Congress in a 
bipartisan manner to pass legislation to assure Americans the privacy of 
their genetic information will be protected and never used to deny 
health coverage or jobs.

Note: The statement referred to S. 1995, the proposed ``Genetic 
Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2002.''
