Memorandum on Excused Absence for Federal Employees in Disaster Areas
July 28, 1993

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Excused Absence for Employees Affected by the Flooding of the 
Mississippi River and Its Tributaries

    I am saddened by the devastating losses caused by the flooding of 
the Mississippi River and its tributaries and the impact on the well-
being and livelihood of our fellow Americans. Many parts of the Federal 
Government have been mobilized to respond to this disaster and to begin 
a massive effort to recover from the ravages of this flooding.
    As part of this effort, I request heads of executive departments and 
agencies who have Federal civilian employees in the areas designated as 
disaster areas because of the flooding to use their discretion to excuse 
from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who 
is faced with a personal emergency because of the flooding and who can 
be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This policy should 
also be applied to any employee who is needed for emergency law 
enforcement, relief, or clean-up efforts authorized by Federal, State or 
local officials having jurisdiction.

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on July 29.
