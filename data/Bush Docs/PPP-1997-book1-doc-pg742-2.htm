Statement on the Murder of Policemen in Northern Ireland
June 16, 1997

    I am outraged by the callous murder by the IRA of two policemen in 
Northern Ireland. I condemn this brutal act of terrorism in the 
strongest possible terms. There can be no reason, no excuse for these 
vicious crimes. I extend my deepest sympathy to the families of the two 
slain officers.
    There is nothing patriotic or heroic about these cowardly killings. 
The overwhelming majority of the people of Ireland, North and South, 
join me in repudiating violence and murder. They know that a just and 
lasting peace is only possible through painstaking dialog and 
negotiation. Further violence can only play into the hands of those 
responsible for the vicious murders of the two policemen. The true 
heroes and patriots are the many people of both communities who work 
tirelessly and peacefully for reconciliation and understanding. I will 
continue to do all I can to support their efforts and the efforts of the 
political leaders participating in the Belfast peace talks.
