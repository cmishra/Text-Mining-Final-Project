Remarks in Kennebunkport, Maine, on the Bombings in the Middle East
August 4, 2002

    Good morning. I'm distressed to hear about the latest suicide 
bombers in Israel. For those who yearn for peace in the Middle East, for 
those in the Arab lands, for those in Europe, for those all around the 
world who yearn for peace, we must do everything we possibly can to stop 
the terror.
    There are a few killers who want to stop the peace process that we 
have started, and we must not let them. For the sake of humanity, for 
the sake of the Palestinians who suffer, for the sake of the Israelis 
who are under attack, we must stop the terror.
    I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these 
terrorist killers.
    Thank you.
    Now watch this drive.

Note: The President spoke at 6:15 a.m. at the Cape Arundel Golf Club, 
prior to a round of golf. A tape was not available for verification of 
the content of these remarks.
