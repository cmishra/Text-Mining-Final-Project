Statement on the Minimum Wage
May 22, 1996

    An increase in the minimum wage would honor our values: work, 
family, responsibility, and opportunity. You cannot raise a family on 
$4.25 an hour. Over the years, both parties have worked together to 
ensure that the minimum wage keeps up with the cost of living. To 
continue that commitment to working families, I have challenged Congress 
to raise the minimum wage by 90 cents. It is clear that a bipartisan 
majority of the House of Representatives stands ready to pass this 
increase.
    But the House leadership is today proposing a giant fraud on the 
American people. Their legislation will eliminate the minimum wage for 
all workers hired by fully two-thirds of American businesses. I hope 
Senator Dole will join me in opposing this extreme measure. We must not 
tolerate sweatshops and a repeal of wage protections for millions of 
Americans as a condition of assuring a living wage for some workers.
    Let me be clear: Eliminating the minimum wage is no way to raise it. 
If Congress sends me a bill to eliminate the minimum wage and wage 
protection for millions of workers, I will veto it. Speaker Gingrich and 
Majority Leader Dole should allow an honest up-or-down vote on the 
minimum wage.
