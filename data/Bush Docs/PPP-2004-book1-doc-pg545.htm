Statement on the Fighting in the Darfur Region of Sudan
April 7, 2004

    New fighting in the Darfur region of Sudan has opened a new chapter 
of tragedy in Sudan's troubled history. The Sudanese Government must 
immediately stop local militias from committing atrocities against the 
local population and must provide unrestricted access to humanitarian 
aid agencies. I condemn these atrocities, which are displacing hundreds 
of thousands of civilians, and I have expressed my views directly to 
President Bashir<al-Bashir, Umar Hassan Ahmad<ls-thn-eq> of Sudan.
    For more than 2\1/2\ years, the United States has been working 
closely with the Government of Sudan and the Sudanese People's 
Liberation Movement (SPLM) to bring peace to Sudan. This civil war is 
one of the worst humanitarian tragedies of our time, responsible for the 
deaths of two million people over two decades. Achieving peace and 
reaching a just and comprehensive agreement must be an urgent priority 
for both sides.
    The United States will move toward normal relations with the 
Government of Sudan only when there is a just and comprehensive peace 
agreement between the Government and the SPLM. All parties must also 
ensure that there is unrestricted access for humanitarian relief 
throughout Sudan, including Darfur, and the Government of Sudan must 
cooperate fully in the war against terrorism.
    I continue to hope for peace for the people of Sudan and for 
normalization of relations between Sudan and the United States. However, 
the Government of Sudan must not remain complicit in the brutalization 
of Darfur. I renew my call to Khartoum to bring the peace process with 
the SPLM to a just conclusion and to bring peace and justice to Darfur.
