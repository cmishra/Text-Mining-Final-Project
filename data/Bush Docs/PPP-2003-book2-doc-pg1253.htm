Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Haifa, Israel
October 4, 2003

    I condemn unequivocally the vicious act of terrorism committed today 
in Haifa, Israel.
    This murderous action, aimed at families gathered to enjoy a Sabbath 
lunch, killed and injured dozens of men, women, and children.
    This despicable attack underscores once again the responsibility of 
Palestinian authorities to fight terror, which remains the foremost 
obstacle to achieving the vision of two states living side by side in 
peace and security. The new Palestinian Cabinet must dedicate itself to 
dismantling the infrastructure of terror and preventing the kind of 
murderous actions that we witnessed today.
    The American people join me in expressing condolences to Prime 
Minister Sharon<Sharon, Ariel<ls-thn-eq> and all the people of Israel 
and in reiterating our common dedication to the cause of fighting 
terrorism.
