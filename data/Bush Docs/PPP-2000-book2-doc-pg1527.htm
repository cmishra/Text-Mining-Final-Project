Statement on the Gun Buyback Initiative
July 30, 2000

    I am pleased that Secretary Cuomo<Cuomo, Andrew M.> and 
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are moving forward 
with their successful gun buyback initiative. By teaming up

[[Page 1528]]

law enforcement, local authorities, and citizens in the fight to reduce 
gun violence, the HUD gun buyback program has already helped remove over 
17,000 guns from our communities. Today's announcement that BuyBack 
America will continue will ensure the removal of thousands more guns, 
preventing an untold number of gun accidents, suicides, and crimes. 
Despite HUD's clear authority to carry out this important program, the 
gun lobby and other opponents of commonsense gun safety measures 
continue to challenge this initiative. We remain committed to carrying 
out BuyBack America, and I call on HUD to continue to offer this vital 
assistance to communities seeking our support in addressing their local 
gun violence problems.
    HUD's gun buybacks are an important part of my administration's 
comprehensive strategy to reduce gun violence in America. While we are 
making progress in this fight, gun violence remains far too high. 
Congress can do its part by finally passing the stalled commonsense gun 
safety legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and 
children and fully funding my $280 million gun enforcement initiative to 
crack down on gun criminals. Congress should put the public safety 
interests of American families above those of the gun lobby and support 
these efforts instead of working to undermine them. If we work together, 
we can continue to bring down gun crime, reduce gun violence, and save 
lives.
