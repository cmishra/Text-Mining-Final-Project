Statement on Signing the Executive Order on Federal Acquisition, 
Recycling, and Waste Prevention
October 20, 1993

    Families, businesses, and communities all across America know that 
recycling makes sense. It saves money and it protects the environment. 
It's time for the Government to set an example and provide real 
leadership that will help create jobs and protect the environment, 
encouraging new markets for recycled products and new technologies.

Note: The President's statement was included in a White House 
announcement on the signing of the Executive order, which is listed in 
Appendix D at the end of this volume.
