Statement on Congressional Action on Amber Alert System Legislation
April 10, 2003

    I applaud the House and Senate for passing bipartisan legislation 
that provides us with additional tools to prevent, investigate, and 
prosecute violent crimes against our children. This legislation builds 
upon the steps my administration took last year to expand, enhance, and 
coordinate the successful Amber Alert system across the Nation. The bill 
also strengthens child pornography laws.
    The safety and well-being of our children is a shared priority for 
all Americans and Federal, State, and local authorities. We must use 
every available resource to find and safely return missing children to 
their families and their homes, and we must use every available tool to 
vigorously prosecute and severely punish those who would do our children 
harm. I look forward to signing this important legislation into law as 
soon as possible.
