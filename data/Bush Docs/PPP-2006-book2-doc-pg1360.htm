Statement on a Report of the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba
July 10, 2006

    Today I approved the second report of the Commission for Assistance 
to a Free Cuba. I also approved a Compact with the People of Cuba, which 
outlines how the United States will support the Cuban people as they 
transition from the repressive control of the Castro<Castro Ruz, 
Fidel<ls-thn-eq> regime to freedom and a genuine democracy. The report 
demonstrates that we are actively working for change in Cuba, not simply 
waiting for change. I call on all our democratic friends and allies 
around the world to join us in supporting freedom for the Cuban people. 
I applaud the work of the Commission, cochaired by Secretary Rice<Rice, 
Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> and Secretary Gutierrez.<Gutierrez, Carlos 
M.<ls-thn-eq>

Note: The statement referred to President Fidel Castro Ruz of Cuba. The 
Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
transcript of this statement.
