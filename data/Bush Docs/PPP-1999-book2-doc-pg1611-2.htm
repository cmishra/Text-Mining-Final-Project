Statement on Postponing Deportation of Certain Liberians from the United 
States
September 27, 1999

    Today I directed the Attorney General<Reno, Janet> and the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service to defer for one year from 
September 29 the deportation of certain Liberians who are present in the 
United States on that date. This action is aimed at promoting stability 
in Liberia and west Africa. In particular, I am concerned that a 
decision by our Government to deport Liberians who have enjoyed the 
protection of our country for many years could cause governments in west 
Africa to deport many thousands of Liberians in their own countries. 
This would severely burden Liberia and threaten the fragile peace that 
has been recently achieved in west Africa. Furthermore, this action 
preserves the status quo for these Liberians while the Congress actively 
considers legislative relief for them.
