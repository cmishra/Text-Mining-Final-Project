Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa 2003
December 19, 2003

    I send greetings to those observing Kwanzaa.
    Celebrated by millions across the world, Kwanzaa honors the history 
and heritage of Africa. This seven-day observance is an opportunity for 
individuals of African descent to remember the sacrifices of their 
ancestors and reflect on the Nguzo Saba. Kwanzaa's seven social and 
spiritual principles offer strength and guidance to meet the challenges 
of each new day.
    During this joyous time of year, Americans renew our commitment to 
hope, understanding, and the great promise of our Nation. In honoring 
the traditions of Africa, Kwanzaa strengthens the ties that bind 
individuals in communities across our country and around the world.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a joyous Kwanzaa.

                                                          George W. Bush
