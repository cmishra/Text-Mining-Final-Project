Statement on the Death of Edward Teller<Teller, Edward<ls-thn-eq>
September 10, 2003

    Edward Teller was a tireless patriot and great American who devoted 
much of his life to making Americans more secure. During his life, Dr. 
Teller received honors including the National Medal of Science and, in 
July, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His notable contributions to 
the security of our Nation will not be forgotten. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending condolences to his family.
