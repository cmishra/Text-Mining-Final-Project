Statement on the Normalization Agreement Between Greece and the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
September 13, 1995

    I welcome the agreement signed by the Foreign Ministers of Greece 
and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in New York today 
normalizing their relations. The agreement is very much in the interest 
of both nations and will significantly strengthen regional stability 
while aiding our efforts to negotiate a wider peace in the Balkans.
    Both Prime Minister Papandreou and President Gligorov deserve 
congratulations for demonstrating the courage and determination needed 
to reach an agreement that was fair to both sides. I hope both 
governments will now proceed to establish friendly and enduring 
bilateral relations while taking steps to resolve their remaining 
differences, including over the name issue.
    I also wish to thank U.N. Special Representative Cyrus Vance and 
U.S. Special Envoy Matthew Nimetz for their tireless efforts in helping 
to mediate the dispute.
    In view of the significant progress represented by this agreement, I 
wrote to President Gligorov earlier in the week inviting his government 
to establish diplomatic relations with the United States. I am pleased 
to announce that I have received his positive response and can confirm 
that diplomatic relations now exist between our two countries.
    I look forward to meeting with the negotiators and representatives 
of the two countries tomorrow to congratulate them personally on this 
important achievement.
