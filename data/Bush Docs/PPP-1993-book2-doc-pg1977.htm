Appointment for the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board
November 12, 1993

    The President appointed four members today to the J. William 
Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board, which selects students, scholars, 
teachers, and trainees to participate in educational exchanges as 
Fulbright scholars. It also finances educational activities for 
Americans abroad and for foreign citizens in the United States and 
promotes American studies in foreign countries and foreign language 
training and area training in the United States. The Board is comprised 
of 12 members, appointed by the President. The new members appointed 
today are Victoria Murphy of Maine, Hoyt Purvis of Arkansas, Robert Rose 
of Connecticut, and Lee Williams of Arkansas.
    ``Like many Arkansans, I have long regarded Senator William 
Fulbright as both a role model and a mentor,'' said the President. ``The 
Fulbright scholarships are his most lasting achievement. I trust that 
these four Board members, two of whom served on his staff, will work to 
preserve his legacy.''

Note: Biographies of the appointees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary. The Office of the Press Secretary also issued a 
clarification which stated that the appointment of Hoyt Purvis would 
take effect on January 1, 1994, while the other appointments were 
effective immediately.
