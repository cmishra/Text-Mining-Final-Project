Remarks to Reporters in Rome, Italy
June 4, 2004

National Economy

    Today's job report shows that the American economy is strong and 
it's getting stronger. Two hundred forty eight thousand jobs for last 
month is good for the American workers. It shows that our economy is 
vital and growing. We've added 900,000 jobs over the last 3 months and 
1.4 million jobs since last August. The policies in place are working. 
The entrepreneurial spirit is strong. The small-business sector of our 
economy is vibrant. And I'm pleased the American worker is doing their 
job.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 6:36 p.m. at the U.S. Ambassador's 
residence. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
these remarks.
