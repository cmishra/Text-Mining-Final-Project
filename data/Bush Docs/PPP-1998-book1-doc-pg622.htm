Statement on Drug Use By Prison Inmates
April 26, 1998

    The report on jail inmates released today by the Justice Department 
confirms the urgent need for Government at all levels to pursue a policy 
of coerced abstinence for drug offenders. The report shows that more 
than half of these criminals used drugs in the month prior to their 
arrest. We have an obligation to install a tough system of testing, 
treatment, and punishment for drug offenders to prevent them from 
returning to the streets with dangerous drug habits intact. Congress can 
take the lead by adopting my administration's proposals to promote 
coerced abstinence throughout the criminal justice system.

Note: This statement was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on April 25 but was embargoed for release until 4:30 p.m. on 
April 26.
