Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Israel
January 5, 2003

    Today terrorists struck again in Israel, murdering and injuring 
scores of civilians in Tel Aviv. I condemn this attack in the strongest 
possible terms. It is a despicable act of murder, and I express my 
condolences to the Government and people of Israel and especially to the 
families of the victims. Secretary Powell<Powell, Colin L.> 
has already spoken to Prime Minister Sharon<Sharon, Ariel> to 
convey the condolences of the American people. The United States remains 
determined to continue our efforts toward peace in the Middle East, a 
goal that the terrorists seek to destroy. All who genuinely seek peace 
in the region must join in the effort to stop terror. The United States 
is determined to continue the global fight against terrorism and against 
the terrorist organizations that conduct operations such as the murders 
in Israel today.
