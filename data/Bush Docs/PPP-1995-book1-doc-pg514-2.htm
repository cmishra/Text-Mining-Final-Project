Message on the Observance of Easter, 1995
April 10, 1995

    Warmest greetings to everyone observing Easter Sunday.
    On this day of great hope and promise, Christians the world over 
celebrate God's redemptive grace as manifested in the life and teachings 
of Jesus of Nazareth. This day symbolizes the victory of good over evil, 
hope over despair, and life over death. Rejoicing in the miracle of 
Easter, we pledge anew to hold in our hearts Christ's message of peace 
and joy.

    As springtime returns to our corner of the earth, we are reminded of 
the beauty of new beginnings. Our faith in God lifts our spirits, and 
many Americans step back from the concerns of daily life to reflect on 
the power of our religious traditions and on the values they teach us. 
During this time of renewal, let us all thank God for the countless 
wonders of creation and rededicate ourselves to the common ideals that 
have made ours a land of infinite blessings.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a joyous Easter 
celebration.

                                                            Bill Clinton
