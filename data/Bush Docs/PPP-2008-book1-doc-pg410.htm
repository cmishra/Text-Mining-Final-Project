Statement on the Presidential Election in Taiwan
March 22, 2008

    I congratulate the people of Taiwan on the successful conclusion of 
their March 22 Presidential election. Once again, Taiwan has 
demonstrated the strength and vitality of its democracy. I also 
congratulate Mr. Ma Ying-jeou<Ma Ying-jeou<ls-thn-eq> on his victory.
    Taiwan is a beacon of democracy to Asia and the world. I am 
confident that the election and the democratic process it represents 
will advance Taiwan as a prosperous, secure, and well-governed society.
    It falls to Taiwan and Beijing to build the essential foundations 
for peace and stability by pursuing dialogue through all available means 
and refraining from unilateral steps that would alter the cross-strait 
situation. I believe the election provides a fresh opportunity for both 
sides to reach out and engage one another in peacefully resolving their 
differences.
    The maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the 
welfare of the people on Taiwan remain of profound importance to the 
United States. We will continue to maintain close unofficial ties with 
the people on Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan, in 
accordance with our longstanding ``one China'' policy, our three joint 
communiques with the People's Republic of China, and the Taiwan 
Relations Act.
