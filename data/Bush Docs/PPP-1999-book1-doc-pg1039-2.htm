Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting
June 29, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:

    In accordance with the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as amended 
(47 U.S.C. 396(i)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1998 and the 
Inventory of the Federal Funds Distributed to Public Telecommunications 
Entities by Federal Departments and Agencies for that same year.

    Among its many outstanding projects over the past year, CPB has put 
considerable time and effort into strengthening the teaching and 
development of America's literary tradition. Working with educators, 
writers, and experts from all across the country, CPB has launched a 
companion website filled with exceptional teaching materials and 
continues to make possible the broadcast of some of the Nation's finest 
literature over our public airwaves. In addition, CPB is also expanding 
the availability of teacher professional development in the social 
sciences, humanities, and literature.

    As we move into the digital age, I am confident that the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting will continue to act as a guiding force. As the 
projects above illustrate, CPB not only

inspires us, it educates and enriches our national culture.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

June 29, 1999.
