Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Boris 
Yeltsin of Russia in Helsinki
March 21, 1997

Russia and NATO

    Q. President Yeltsin, do you consider NATO a threat to Russia, or 
are you convinced otherwise by now?
    President Yeltsin. Well, I'm not convinced otherwise.
    President Clinton. We'll have a press conference later, guys.
    Q. You guys always give us a surprise when you meet, Mr. President. 
Do you expect any surprises today?
    President Yeltsin. Perhaps through the course of the discussions we 
may have some surprises. We won't have any surprises at the end of the 
discussions.

Note: The exchange began at 9:43 a.m. at Mantyniemi, the residence of 
President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. President Yeltsin spoke in 
Russian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter. A tape was 
not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
