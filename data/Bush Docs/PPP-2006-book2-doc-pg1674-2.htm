Statement on Senate Confirmation of Alice S. Fisher<Fisher, Alice 
S.<ls-thn-eq> as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at 
the Department of Justice
September 19, 2006

    I am pleased that the Senate acted today to confirm Alice S. Fisher 
as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at the 
Department of Justice.
    Alice is a talented and effective public servant. As Acting 
Assistant Attorney General, she has led hundreds of DOJ attorneys and 
other staff in their efforts to combat terrorism, gang violence, drug 
trafficking, corruption, fraud, and crimes against children. I am 
confident she will continue to dedicate herself to keeping Americans 
safe from crime and bringing those who violate our laws to justice.
    I continue to encourage the Senate to provide all of my nominees a 
prompt up-or-down vote.
