Statement on the Assassination of Minister of Industry Pierre 
Gemayel<Gemayel, Pierre<ls-thn-eq> of Lebanon
November 21, 2006

    Today's assassination of Lebanese Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel 
shows yet again the viciousness of those who are trying to destabilize 
that country.
    The United States remains fully committed to supporting Lebanon's 
independence and democracy in the face of attempts by Syria, Iran, and 
their allies within Lebanon to foment instability and violence. Syria's 
refusal to cease and desist from its continuing efforts to destabilize 
Lebanon's democratically elected Government is a repeated violation of 
United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701. The United 
States will continue its efforts with allied nations and democratic 
forces in Lebanon to resist these efforts and protect Lebanon's 
sovereignty and democratic institutions.
    We urge the U.N. Security Council and the Secretary-General<Annan, 
Kofi<ls-thn-eq> today to take the remaining steps needed to establish 
the special tribunal for Lebanon that will try those accused of 
involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Hariri, and to 
ensure that that tribunal can also bring to justice those responsible 
for related assassinations, assassination attempts, and other terrorist 
attacks. We also demand that Syria treat Lebanon as a genuinely 
sovereign neighbor, establishing full diplomatic relations with Lebanon, 
and delineating its border with that country including, in particular, 
in the Shab'a Farms area, through a bilateral agreement.
