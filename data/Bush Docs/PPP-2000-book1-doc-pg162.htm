Message to the Senate Transmitting the France-United States Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty With Documentation
January 31, 2000

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of 
the United States of America and the Government of France on Mutual 
Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Paris on December 10, 
1998. I transmit also, for the Senate's information, an explanatory note 
agreed between the Parties regarding the application of certain 
provisions. The report of the Department of State with respect to the 
Treaty is enclosed.
    The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance 
treaties being negotiated by the United States in order to counter 
criminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective 
tool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of crimes, including 
terrorism and drug trafficking offenses. The Treaty is self-executing.
    The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal 
matters. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: 
obtaining the testimony or statements of persons; providing documents, 
records, and items of evidence; locating or identifying persons or 
items; serving documents; transferring persons in custody for testimony 
or other purposes; executing requests for searches and seizures; 
assisting in proceedings related to immobilization and forfeiture of 
assets, restitution, and collection of fines; and rendering any other 
form of assistance not prohibited by the laws of the Requested State.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

January 31, 2000.
