Exchange With Reporters
January 22, 1997

16th Street Explosion

    Q. [Inaudible]--the explosion near the abortion clinic this 
morning--any thoughts on that?
    The President. Let me say that we do not yet have all the facts 
involving the incidents this morning. But Federal officials are working 
with the local law enforcement officials to get to the bottom of this. I 
want to emphasize again, as I had to do just a few days ago, that acts 
of violence against people who are trying to exercise their 
constitutional rights are acts of terror. They are illegal. They are 
wrong. And we will do our very best to investigate them, to catch who is 
doing it, and to make sure they're punished. But as to the incidents 
this morning, we are still investigating them. The facts are unfolding. 
Whatever happened, there is never an excuse for an act of violence 
against someone exercising a constitutional right.
    Q. [Inaudible]--at the Mayflower, Mr. President?
    The President. We're on top of the situation, I believe. We're doing 
our very best. And obviously I'm concerned about the safety of anybody 
involved that might be subject to that sort of thing. But the 
investigators are there, and we're working hard on it.

Note: The exchange began at 9:14 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House, prior to the President's departure for Chicago, IL.
