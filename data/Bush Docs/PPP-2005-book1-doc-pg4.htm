Remarks After Signing the Book of Condolence at the Indonesian Embassy
January 3, 2005

    It's our honor to come today to pay our respects for those in 
Indonesia who suffered under this tremendous disaster. I appreciate the 
former<Clinton, William J.<ls-thn-eq> Presidents<Bush, George 
H.W.<ls-thn-eq> joining me. I'm proud Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> is 
here too as we sign the condolence book.
    We're also committed to helping the Indonesian Government and the 
people of Indonesia. Presidents Clinton<Clinton, William J.<ls-thn-eq> 
and Bush<Bush, George H.W.<ls-thn-eq> have agreed to help tap into the 
great generosity of the American people by serving as cochairmen of what 
will be a massive private relief effort. Of course, I will continue to 
make sure our Government provides relief as well. I look forward to 
working with the Indonesian Government to help those who need food and 
medicine and water and shelter to get their lives back in order so that 
the great country of Indonesia can rise up from this disaster and 
provide the hope necessary for the people of that important country.
    It's our honor to be here with our friend and ally. Mr. 
Ambassador,<Soemadi, Brotodiningrat<ls-thn-eq> thank you for having us. 
May God bless the people of Indonesia.

Note: The President spoke at 10:40 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Indonesia's Ambassador to the U.S. Soemadi Brotodiningrat.
