Statement Announcing the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe
October 4, 1993

    I am pleased to announce that I have nominated and NATO has 
appointed Gen. George A. Joulwan, U.S. Army, to succeed Gen. John 
Shalikashvili as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe. I also intend to send 
forward to Congress General Joulwan's nomination to serve as commander 
in chief, U.S. European Command.
    General Joulwan has had a long and highly distinguished career 
spanning more than three decades, with Europe as the centerpiece of his 
service. He has served for 14 years in Europe, beginning as a platoon 
commander and rising to Commanding General of the V Corps, U.S. Army 
Europe and 7th Army. In these postings, as well as in his current role 
as commander in chief of the U.S. Southern Command, Panama, he has 
demonstrated both the military expertise and political acumen needed to 
fill one of our most sensitive security postings. He has also displayed 
superb talents as a manager of resources and personnel and is known 
throughout the military as a ``soldier's soldier.''
    General Joulwan assumes the post of Supreme Allied Commander at an 
important time of change for Europe and for NATO as we seek to adapt the 
role of NATO to the needs of post-cold-war mutual security. I will look 
to General Joulwan to continue the outstanding work of General 
Shalikashvili as SACEUR faces up to the challenge of helping guide NATO 
through this important period of transition. I have the utmost trust and 
confidence in his ability to do so.
