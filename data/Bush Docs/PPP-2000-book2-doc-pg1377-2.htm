Statement on the Election of Vicente Fox<Fox, Vicente> as 
President of Mexico
July 3, 2000

    I called President-elect Vicente Fox today to offer my 
congratulations and those of the American people on his historic victory 
in Mexico's national elections yesterday. I also spoke to President 
Zedillo<Zedillo, Ernesto> to express my admiration for his 
extraordinary contributions to Mexico, including his efforts in working 
with other Mexican leaders to strengthen and deepen democracy. Mexicans 
should be proud of the extraordinary steps they have taken during the 
last 6 years to strengthen and consolidate democratic institutions and 
set Mexico on a course of economic growth and prosperity.
    Mexico is our neighbor and friend. Mexico's national elections, the 
freest and fairest in the nation's history, stand as a vivid testimony 
to the depth of the democratic commitment of the Mexican people. I 
reiterated both to President-elect Fox and President Zedillo<Zedillo, 
Ernesto> that the United States stands ready to work to 
enhance the close cooperation that characterizes our bilateral 
relationship.
