Statement on the Cease-Fire in Northern Ireland
October 13, 1994

    I welcome today's announcement by the Combined Loyalist Military 
Command in Northern Ireland declaring an end to its campaign of 
violence. The cease-fire announcement by the IRA on August 31 and 
today's announcement by Loyalist paramilitaries present the best hope 
for peace in a generation in Northern Ireland. The parties must now 
build on this historic step forward and enter into negotiations for a 
lasting settlement.
    Prime Minister John Major of the United Kingdom and Prime Minister 
Albert Reynolds of Ireland deserve great credit for their leadership and 
persistence in pressing for progress. The principles put forward in 
their Downing Street Declaration provide an important foundation for a 
just and lasting peace. I look forward to the next steps in the process, 
including the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation proposed by Prime 
Minister Reynolds and the roundtable talks convened by the Irish and 
British Governments with all involved parties.
    I am pleased that the United States has been able to contribute to 
the peace process in Northern Ireland. We continue to stand ready to 
assist in achieving a negotiated, democratic settlement supported by 
both communities in Northern Ireland.
