Statement on Congressional Action on the Budget Resolution
April 11, 2003

    I commend House and Senate negotiators for their hard work and 
success in ensuring that the Congress has a budget resolution in place 
that reflects my priorities of winning the war against terrorism, 
protecting Americans at home, and strengthening economic growth. I 
particularly congratulate Chairmen Nickles<Nickles, Don> and 
Nussle<Nussle, Jim> for their leadership, not only in 
accomplishing agreement but in doing so ahead of schedule. The 
compromise budget resolution funds our priorities, restrains spending, 
and provides opportunity for passage of a robust jobs-and-growth 
package. I commend the House for passing this measure and look forward 
to prompt passage in the Senate.
