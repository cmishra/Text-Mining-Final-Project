Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Request for Fiscal Year 2009 Supplemental Appropriations for Ongoing 
Military and Intelligence Operations and Selected Other International 
Activities
May 2, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2009 
Budget that provide the necessary resources for ongoing military and 
intelligence operations, as well as foreign assistance activities in 
support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. They 
also provide the necessary resources for selected other international 
activities that advance our national security, including food assistance 
to address the global food crisis.
    These amendments distribute by account $70 billion of discretionary 
budget authority included as an allowance in my FY 2009 Budget for the 
Global War on Terror. This amount is already factored into the FY 2009 
Budget projections and would not increase the deficit.
    I hereby designate the specific proposals in the amounts requested 
herein as emergency requirements. This request represents urgent and 
essential requirements. The details of the request are set forth in the 
enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
