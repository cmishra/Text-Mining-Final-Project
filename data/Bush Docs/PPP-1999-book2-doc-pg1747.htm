Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Naval Petroleum 
Reserves
October 8, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 201(3) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves 
Production Act of 1976 (10 U.S.C. 7422)(c)(2), I am informing you of my 
decision to extend the period of production of the naval petroleum 
reserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, 2000, the expiration date 
of the currently authorized period of production.
    Attached is a copy of the report investigating the necessity of 
continued production of the reserves as required by 10 U.S.C. 
7422(c)(2)(B). In light of the findings contained in that report, I 
certify that continued production from the naval petroleum reserves is 
in the national interest.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

October 8, 1999.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
October 12.
