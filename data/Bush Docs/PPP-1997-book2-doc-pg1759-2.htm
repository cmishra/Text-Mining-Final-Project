Statement on the International Financial Services Agreement
December 12, 1997

    Since I took office, I have been committed to tearing down barriers 
to American goods and services exports. Today's agreement by over 70 
countries to liberalize trade in financial services will ensure market 
access in sectors where we lead the world: banking, securities, and 
insurance. In the wake of recent financial instability, it is 
particularly encouraging that so many countries have chosen to move 
forward rather than backwards. I want to congratulate Secretary Rubin, 
Ambassador Barshefsky, Deputy Secretary Summers, Deputy U.S. Trade 
Representative Lang, and Assistant Secretary Geithner for their hard 
work in bringing these negotiations to a successful conclusion.
