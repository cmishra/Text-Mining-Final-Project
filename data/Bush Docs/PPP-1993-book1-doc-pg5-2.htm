Letter on Withdrawal of the Nomination of Zoe Baird To Be Attorney 
General
January 22, 1993

Dear Zoe:
    I have received your letter asking that I withdraw your nomination 
as Attorney General of the United States from further consideration by 
the Senate. With sadness, I accept your request that the nomination be 
withdrawn.
    You are an exceptionally gifted attorney, and a person of great 
decency and integrity. You have responded to the call of public service 
with energy and a firm dedication to the mission of the Justice 
Department. I realize that it was your candid disclosure of the child 
care matter that led to the circumstances we face today. I believe that 
the concerns raised about your child care situation were unique to the 
position of Attorney General.
    You are highly qualified to be Attorney General. Your stated goals 
for a nonpartisan, independent and strongly managed Department of 
Justice were fully in accord with my own. I believe you would have been 
a fine Attorney General.
    Hillary and I value your and Paul's friendship. We look forward to 
seeing you often. I hope that you will be available for other 
assignments for your country in my Administration.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: The White House also made available Ms. Baird's letter requesting 
that her nomination to be Attorney General be withdrawn.
