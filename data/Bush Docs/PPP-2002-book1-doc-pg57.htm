Remarks on Departure for East Moline, Illinois, and an Exchange With 
Reporters
January 14, 2002

President's Health

    The President. My mother always said when you're eating pretzels, 
chew before you swallow. Listen to your mother. I feel great--looking 
forward to a good trip.
    Q. What happened?
    The President. I hit the deck and woke up, and there was Barney and 
Spot showing a lot of concern. I didn't realize what happened until I 
looked in the mirror and my glasses cut my side of my face.
    I feel great. I had good blood pressure last night, good blood 
pressure this morning.
    Q. [Inaudible]
    The President. Yes, yes. Anyway, going to have a great trip. Good to 
see you all.

Note: The President spoke at 8:05 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House.
