Memorandum on Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research
January 22, 1993

Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services

Subject: Federal Funding of Fetal Tissue Transplantation Research

    On March 22, 1988, the Assistant Secretary for Health of Health and 
Human Services (``HHS'') imposed a temporary moratorium on Federal 
funding of research involving transplantation of fetal tissue from 
induced abortions. Contrary to the recommendations of a National 
Institutes of Health advisory panel, on November 2, 1989, the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services extended the moratorium indefinitely. This 
moratorium has significantly hampered the development of possible 
treatments for individuals afflicted with serious diseases and 
disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, 
and leukemia. Accordingly, I hereby direct that you immediately lift the 
moratorium.
    You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in 
the Federal Register.

                                                      William J. Clinton

[Filed with the Office of the Federal Register, 1:17 p.m., February 3, 
1993]
