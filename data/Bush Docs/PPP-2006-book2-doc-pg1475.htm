Remarks at a White House Tee-Ball Game
July 30, 2006

    Thank you very much. You know, as we listen to our national anthem, 
it reminds us how blessed we are to live in a land where our boys and 
girls can grow up in a peaceful world. And on today our hopes for peace 
for boys and girls everywhere extends across the world, especially in 
the Middle East. Today's actions in the Middle East remind us that the 
United States and friends and allies must work for a sustainable peace, 
particularly for the sake of children.
    And so I want to welcome you here to the White House. What an honor 
to be with the commissioner, Willie Mays.<Mays, Willie H.<ls-thn-eq> 
See, when I was growing up, I wanted to be the Willie Mays of my 
generation, but I couldn't hit a curve ball. So instead, I ended up 
being President.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I welcome you here, along with the 
commissioner.<Mays, Willie H.<ls-thn-eq> It's a proud day for us to 
welcome--a little hot for baseball, but I know these teams are up for 
it. First, I want to welcome the Civitan Club of Frederick Challengers 
from Thurmont, Maryland. We're glad you all are here. We also want to 
welcome the mayor, Mayor Marty Burns<Burns, Martin A.<ls-thn-eq> of 
Thurmont. Welcome, Mr. Mayor. Thanks for coming. There he is. Marty used 
to work at Camp David, by the way.
    I also want to welcome the Challenger Braves from Shady Spring, West 
Virginia.
    We welcome both teams, the coaches, the helpers, and the families. 
We're glad you're here. We're lucky today to have not only one Major 
Leaguer but three Major Leaguers with us--coaching first base, the 
lefty, Al Leiter;<Leiter, Al<ls-thn-eq> welcome, Al--at third base, Dan 
Wilson.<Wilson, Dan<ls-thn-eq> Glad you're here, Dan. Thanks for coming. 
Proud you're here.
    We welcome Steve Keener,<Keener, Stephen D.<ls-thn-eq> who is the 
president and CEO of Little League International. We want to thank the 
Girl Scout Council of the Nation's Capital who carried the colors. I 
want to thank Nichola Kouzes,<Kouzes, Nichola<ls-thn-eq> who sang the 
national anthem. Nichola, you did a fabulous job here on the South Lawn. 
Thank you. She did a good job, didn't she? Not only a good job but a 
great job.
    We're lucky today to have an old hand at calling this game, the 
former announcer of the Washington Senators, Charlie Brotman.<Brotman, 
Charlie<ls-thn-eq> Welcome, Charlie. Glad you're here. Thanks for 
coming. Glad you're here.

    And finally, we have a tradition here, and that is, we actually 
don't throw out the first ball; we actually put the first ball on the 
tee. And joining me today is Kevin Turley.<Turley, Kevin<ls-thn-eq> He's 
a Special Olympics gold medalist. Kevin, thanks for coming. Thank you 
for being a part of this.
    You ready? Everybody ready? And right before we play ball, we'll 
give the Little League Pledge. Ready for the pledge?

[At this point, the pledge was recited.]

    Play ball.

Note: The President spoke at 2:45 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to White House Tee-Ball Commissioner 
Willie Mays. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on July 31.
