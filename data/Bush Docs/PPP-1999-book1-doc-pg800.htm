Statement on the Election of Ehud Barak<Barak, Ehud> as Prime 
Minister of Israel
May 17, 1999

    On behalf of the American people, I want to extend my warmest 
congratulations to Ehud Barak upon his election as Israel's new Prime 
Minister. The people of Israel have given the new Prime Minister a 
strong mandate.
    I have just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu<Netanyahu, 
Binyamin> to thank him for his dedicated service to Israel. I 
also spoke with Prime Minister-elect Barak to congratulate him and 
reaffirm our Nation's steadfast support for Israel and its people. I 
will continue to work energetically for a just, lasting, and 
comprehensive peace that strengthens Israel's security. I look forward 
to working closely with Ehud Barak and his new government as they strive 
to reach that goal with their Palestinian and Arab partners.
