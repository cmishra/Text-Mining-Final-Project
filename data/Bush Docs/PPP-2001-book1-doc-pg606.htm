Statement on the Terrorist Bombing in Tel Aviv, Israel
June 1, 2001

    I condemn in the strongest terms the heinous terrorist attack in Tel 
Aviv this Sabbath evening. There is no justification for senseless 
attacks against innocent civilians. This illustrates the urgent need for 
an immediate, unconditional cessation of violence. I call upon Chairman 
Arafat<Arafat, Yasser<ls-thn-eq> to condemn this act and to call for an 
immediate cease fire. My deepest condolences and those of the American 
people go out to the victims and their families.

Note: The statement referred to Chairman Yasser Arafat of the 
Palestinian Authority.
