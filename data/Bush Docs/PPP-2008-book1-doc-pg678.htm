Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony in Tel Aviv, Israel
May 14, 2008

    Mr. President<Peres, Shimon<ls-thn-eq> and Mr. Prime 
Minister,<Olmert, Ehud<ls-thn-eq> Mrs. Olmert,<Olmert, Aliza<ls-thn-eq> 
thank you very much for your warm welcome. It's good to be back again. 
We're proud to reaffirm the friendship of our peoples, and we're 
delighted to join you in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the State 
of Israel.
    Our two nations both faced great challenges when they were founded, 
and our two nations have both relied on the same principles to help us 
succeed. We've built strong democracies to protect the freedoms given to 
us by an Almighty God. We've welcomed immigrants who've helped us 
thrive. We've built prosperous economies by rewarding innovation and 
risk-taking and trade. And we've built an enduring alliance to confront 
terrorists and tyrants.
    Americans and Israelis can be proud of our past, and the best way to 
honor our founders is to continue the work they started. Tomorrow I'm 
going to address the members of the Knesset and the people of Israel. I 
look forward to discussing how I believe our two nations can continue to 
advance our ideals and approach our next 60 years of partnership with 
confidence and with hope.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I appreciate your invitation, your 
kind invitation to share these days of celebration with you. We consider 
the Holy Land a very special place, and we consider the Israeli people 
our close friends.
    Shalom.

Note: The President spoke at 11:32 a.m. at Ben Gurion International 
Airport. In his remarks, he referred to President Shimon Peres and Prime 
Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel; and Aliza Olmert, wife of Prime Minister 
Olmert. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
also included the remarks of President Peres and Prime Minister Olmert.
