Statement on House of Representatives Action on Debt-Relief Legislation
July 13, 2000

    While the bill passed today underfunds vital international 
priorities and should not become law, the Waters amendment passed by the 
House of Representatives increasing funding to the Heavily Indebted 
Poorest Countries (HIPC) initiative is an enormously encouraging step. 
Relieving the world's poorest nations of crushing debt obligations will 
help free up crucial funds for education, health care, and basic human 
needs. Unsustainable debt continues to help keep too many poor countries 
and poor people in poverty. I urge Congress to pass the full amount that 
I have requested for debt relief this year. As it stands, this bill 
still falls far short of what is necessary to fully implement this 
initiative.
