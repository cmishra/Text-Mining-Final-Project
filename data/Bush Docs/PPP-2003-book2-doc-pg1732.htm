Statement on Senator John Breaux's<Breaux, John<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not 
To Seek Reelection
December 15, 2003

    John Breaux is a distinguished public servant. His tenure in the 
Senate has been marked by bipartisan statesmanship, results for the 
people of Louisiana, and dedicated service for America.
    During more than 30 years in the Congress, John Breaux has put party 
politics aside to get things done for the American people. His 
leadership in getting the 2001 tax cut passed helped spur economic 
growth and job creation, and his vision and tenacity on Medicare reform 
have now helped provide senior citizens with long-awaited prescription 
drug benefits and more choices in health care. He also has been a leader 
in the effort to pass comprehensive energy legislation, among many other 
legislative achievements.
    It is with deep respect that Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
extend our gratitude and best wishes to John, his wife, Lois,<Breaux, 
Lois<ls-thn-eq> and their children.
