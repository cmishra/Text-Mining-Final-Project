Message on the Observance of Cinco de Mayo, 2007
May 4, 2007

    I send greetings to those celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
    The story of Cinco de Mayo represents the triumph of liberty over 
tyranny and a joyful moment in Mexican history. In 1862, Mexican General 
Ignacio Zaragoza and his militia defended their independence and won an 
important victory for freedom. Because of their courage, Mexican 
citizens would come to know the full blessings of liberty, and their 
triumph at the Battle of Puebla remains an inspiration to all who thirst 
for freedom.
    Cinco de Mayo is also an opportunity to celebrate the warm ties 
between Mexico and the United States. Geography has made us neighbors, 
but our friendship is based on shared values of family, democracy, and 
faith. Our country is grateful for the countless contributions of 
Mexican Americans whose hard work and strong character have strengthened 
our country. On Cinco de Mayo and throughout the year, may we remember 
that together we can build a better life and a future of hope for both 
our peoples.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a 
festive Cinco de Mayo.

                                                          George W. Bush
