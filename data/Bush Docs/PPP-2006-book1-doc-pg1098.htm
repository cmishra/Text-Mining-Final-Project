Statement on Senate Passage of Marriage Protection Legislation
June 7, 2006

    Today's Senate vote on the marriage protection amendment marks the 
start of a new chapter in this important national debate. I thank the 
Senators who supported this amendment, but I am disappointed the Senate 
did not achieve the necessary number of votes to move the amendment 
process forward. Our Nation's founders set a high bar for amending our 
Constitution, and history has shown us that it can take several tries 
before an amendment builds the two-thirds support it needs in both 
houses of Congress. My position on this issue is clear: Marriage is the 
most fundamental institution of our society, and it should not be 
redefined by activist judges. The people must be heard on this issue. 
And as this debate continues, each American deserves to be treated with 
tolerance, respect, and dignity.

Note: The statement referred to S.J. Res. 1.
