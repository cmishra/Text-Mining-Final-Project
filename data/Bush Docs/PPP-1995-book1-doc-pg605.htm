Statement on the Death of Naomi Nover
April 25, 1995

    Hillary and I were so saddened to learn of the death of Naomi Nover. 
Naomi's years of dedication to her craft and her efforts to cover events 
here at the White House up until just a few months before her death were 
a lesson to us all in hard work and the persistence of the human spirit. 
She will be missed greatly, and our thoughts are with her sisters and 
the rest of her family at this difficult time.
