Remarks at a Dinner Hosted by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice<Rice, 
Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> for Annapolis Conference Participants
November 26, 2007

    Madam Secretary, thank you for your hospitality. I was wondering 
where my place is. [Laughter] I appreciate very much your hosting this 
important dinner.
    Prime Minister Olmert,<Olmert, Ehud<ls-thn-eq> welcome. President 
Abbas,<Abbas, Mahmoud ``Abu Mazen''<ls-thn-eq> Secretary-General 
Ban,<Ban Ki-moon<ls-thn-eq> former Prime Minister Tony Blair,<Blair, 
Tony<ls-thn-eq> and all those who have gathered here in the cause of 
peace, welcome to the United States. We're glad you're here.
    We've come together this week because we share a common goal: two 
democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace 
and security.

[[Page 1496]]

    Achieving this goal requires difficult compromises, and the Israelis 
and Palestinians have elected leaders committed to making them. 
Achieving this goal requires neighbors committed to peace between Israel 
and a new Palestinian state, and I'm encouraged by the presence of so 
many here. Achieving this goal requires the commitment of the 
international community, including the United States. Tonight I restate 
my personal commitment on behalf of the United States to all those in 
the Middle East who wish to live in freedom and peace. We stand with you 
at the Annapolis Conference and beyond.
    The extremists and terrorists want our efforts to fail. They're 
working actively to undermine every effort as we try to achieve peace 
and reconciliation. We offer a more hopeful vision of a Middle East 
growing in freedom and dignity and prosperity. We are here to renew our 
efforts to achieve this vision. And tonight I offer a toast to all of 
our honored guests and to the future of peace that we can build 
together.

Note: The President spoke at 7:10 p.m. at the Department of State. In 
his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel; 
President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority; Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations; and former Prime Minister Tony Blair 
of the United Kingdom, Quartet Representative in the Middle East.
