Statement on the Death of Timothy J. Russert<Russert, Tim<ls-thn-eq>
June 13, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the sudden 
passing of Tim Russert. Those of us who knew and worked with Tim, his 
many friends, and the millions of Americans who loyally followed his 
career on the air will all miss him.
    As the longest serving host of the longest running program in the 
history of television, he was an institution in both news and politics 
for more than two decades. Tim was a tough and hard-working newsman. He 
was always well informed and thorough in his interviews, and he was as 
gregarious off the set as he was prepared on it.
    Most important, Tim was a proud son and father, and Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I offer our deepest sympathies to his wife 
Maureen,<Orth, Maureen<ls-thn-eq> his son Luke,<Russert, Luke<ls-thn-eq> 
and the entire Russert family. We will keep them in our prayers.
