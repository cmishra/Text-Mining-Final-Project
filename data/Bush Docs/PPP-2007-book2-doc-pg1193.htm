Message on the Observance of Ramadan
September 7, 2007

    I send greetings to Muslims observing Ramadan in America and around 
the world.
    Ramadan, the holiest days of the Islamic faith, begins with the 
first light of dawn and commemorates the revelation of the Qur'an to the 
prophet Muhammad. During the days of fasting, prayer, and worship, 
Muslims reflect and remember their dependence on God. Ramadan is also an 
occasion for Muslims to strengthen family and community ties and share 
God's gifts with those in need.
    America is a land of many faiths, and our society is enriched by our 
Muslim citizens. May the holy days of Ramadan remind us all to seek a 
culture of compassion and serve others in charity.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes. Ramadan 
Mubarak.

                                                          George W. Bush
