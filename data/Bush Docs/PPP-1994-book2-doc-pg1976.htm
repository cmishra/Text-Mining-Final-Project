Statement on the Flood and Fire Disaster in Durunka, Egypt
November 3, 1994

    I am deeply saddened to learn of the disaster in the Egyptian town 
of Durunka, as well as storm damage in other parts of the country. Mrs. 
Clinton and I join all Americans in extending our condolences to the 
families of the victims of this tragedy.
    We are grateful for the warm welcome offered to us by the Egyptian 
people during our recent visit. I have instructed the U.S. Agency for 
International Development to offer cooperation and assistance to 
Egyptian relief operations. The people of Egypt can be sure that their 
American friends will stand by them in coping with the aftermath of this 
terrible event.
