Statement on the Report on Substance Abuse and Women
June 5, 1996

    The report by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse 
at Columbia University (CASA) on ``Substance Abuse and the American 
Woman'' reveals the distinctive characteristics of alcohol, tobacco, and 
drug abuse by women. The report, based on a 2-year study, provides 
valuable new insights into this pressing problem and documents long-term 
trends that show young women closing the gender gap with young men in 
substance abuse.
    The report also points out a unique consequence of substance abuse 
among women, the effect of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use on newborn 
children. My administration is determined to do all we can to curb 
alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse by young Americans, and this report 
will contribute to that effort. I congratulate Joe Califano, the 
president of CASA, and the center for their fine work in combating 
substance abuse. I especially salute Betty Ford for her courage and 
commitment in devoting her life to helping America deal with drug and 
alcohol abuse and addiction.
