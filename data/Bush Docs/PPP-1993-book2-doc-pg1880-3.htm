Nomination for Under Secretary of Energy
November 1, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Charles B. 
Curtis to be the Under Secretary of Energy. After he is confirmed, he 
will assume management responsibility for science and technology 
programs, weapons and waste cleanup programs, and energy policy matters 
assigned by the Secretary.
    ``There are few Americans who can match Charles Curtis' governmental 
experience or his knowledge of energy policy,'' said the President. ``He 
will be an outstanding addition to Secretary O'Leary's team at the 
Energy Department.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
