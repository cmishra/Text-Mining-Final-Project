Statement on the Death of Sister M. Isolina Ferre<Ferre, M. 
Isolina>
August 3, 2000

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Sister Isolina 
Ferre. Her passionate fight, for more than 60 years, against poverty, 
violence, and despair earned her many awards and countless tributes from 
all around the world. Armed only with her faith, she taught gangs in New 
York City to solve their differences without violence. In Puerto Rico, 
her community service centers, the Centros Isolina Ferre, transformed 
ravaged neighborhoods by operating clinics and helping residents to 
empower themselves.
    Almost a year ago today, I was honored to welcome Sister Isolina to 
the White House and present her with the Medal of Freedom. At that 
ceremony, I said, ``Sister Isolina taught people to see the best in 
themselves and in their communities and made sure they had the tools to 
make the most of the gifts God has given them.''
    Her lifetime of selfless commitment to others will remain her 
greatest legacy. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and many 
friends.
