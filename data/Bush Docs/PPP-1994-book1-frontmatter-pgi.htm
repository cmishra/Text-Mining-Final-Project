                                Foreword

    During the first half of 1994, America moved forward to enhance 
security at home and abroad--creating opportunity, shrinking 
bureaucracy, and giving our people the means to realize the American 
Dream. By June 1994, our Administration's economic plan had helped 
create close to 4 million new jobs. Fifteen million working families 
with children and countless small businesses enjoyed a tax cut.

    In our efforts to keep our country strong and secure, our government 
became a better partner with the American people. During a time of great 
change, our Administration invested in education and training to help 
all Americans earn the tools they need to compete and win in the global 
economy. I signed ``Goals 2000'' into law, setting world-class standards 
for our schools and giving local communities the flexibility to achieve 
excellence. I signed the ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act,'' bringing 
teachers and businesses together to help non-college bound students move 
directly from school to work. Across the country, AmeriCorps members 
earned money for college while serving our country--tutoring young 
people, cleaning up neighborhoods, and making communities safer for all 
of us. Thanks to our reforms of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
we were able to come to the aid of families from northern California to 
southern Florida.

    Security at home requires even more of us. To help restore safety in 
our homes and neighborhoods, we fought for passage in Congress of a 
tough, smart crime bill, that included provisions for putting 100,000 
new police officers on our streets. At our urging, the House of 
Representatives passed a ban on 19 deadly assault weapons. In an effort 
central to the strength of our families, our economy, and our future, 
Americans took up the challenge of health care reform. Together, we 
engaged in an important debate in Congress and across the country and 
worked toward bringing health care security to every American.

    We worked to keep America strong abroad, as well. As it has been for 
half a century, our Nation remained the world's greatest force for 
freedom and democracy. Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the D-Day 
invasion at Normandy, I had the privilege to join with our allies in 
remembering a generation who helped preserve the blessings of liberty 
for us all. This year, Americans and people around the world realized 
anew the rewards of our leadership. We opened markets from Latin America 
to Asia to American goods. We supported democracy in Russia, which I 
visited, and in South Africa, where Vice President Al Gore and the First 
Lady witnessed the triumph of free and fair elections. And we advanced 
the cause of peace around the globe.

    This volume reflects America's ongoing commitment to rewarding those 
who work and study and dream of building a better life. Our citizens can 
take great pride in their progress. Their accomplishments assure us that 
America's best days are still to come.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period January 1-July 31, 1994. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush are 
also available.
