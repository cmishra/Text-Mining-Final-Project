Remarks at the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association Dinner
March 28, 2007

    Thank you, Brian.<Wilson, Brian<ls-thn-eq> Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are happy to be here. I'd like to thank the Radio 
and TV Correspondents' Association for providing dinner tonight. And I'd 
like to thank Senator Webb for providing security. [Laughter]
    I'm glad to see everybody here is enjoying themselves. Don't think I 
haven't noticed all the drinking that's been going on. [Laughter] In my 
State of the Union Address, I said we needed to increase the use of 
ethanol. [Laughter]
    Well, where should I start? A year ago, my approval rating was in 
the thirties; my nominee<Miers, Harriet E.<ls-thn-eq> for the Supreme 
Court had just withdrawn; and my Vice President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> 
had shot someone. [Laughter] Ah, those were the good old days. 
[Laughter] Sorry the Vice President couldn't be here. [Laughter] He's 
had a rough few weeks. To be honest, his feelings are kind of hurt. He 
said he was going on vacation to Afghanistan, where people like him. 
[Laughter]
    You in the press certainly have had a lot to report lately. Take the 
current controversy. I have to admit, we really blew the way we let 
those attorneys go. You know you've botched it when people sympathize 
with lawyers. [Laughter]
    Speaking of subpoenas, it's good to see Speaker Pelosi<Pelosi, 
Nancy<ls-thn-eq> tonight. [Laughter] You know, some have wondered how 
the two of us would get along. Some say she's bossy; she's opinionated; 
she's not to be crossed--hey, I get along with my mother.<Bush, 
Barbara<ls-thn-eq> [Laughter]
    But between the Congress and the press, there is a lot of scrutiny 
in this job. Not a day goes by that I don't get scrutineered one way or 
the other. [Laughter] The press is a lot tougher the second term. It's 
reached the point I sometimes call on Helen Thomas<Thomas, 
Helen<ls-thn-eq> just to hear a friendly voice. [Laughter]
    No matter how tough it gets, however, I have no intention of 
becoming a lameduck President, unless, of course, Cheney<Cheney, 
Dick<ls-thn-eq> accidentally shoots me in the leg. [Laughter] Hey, I 
have 664 days left in the White House, so technically, I'm a temporary 
guest-worker. [Laughter]
    I'm considering what's next. President Clinton,<Clinton, William 
J.<ls-thn-eq> of course, wrote a very successful Presidential memoirs, 
with 10,000 pages or something. [Laughter] I'm thinking of something 
really fun and creative for mine--you know, maybe a popup book. 
[Laughter] I'm considering a number of titles--which do you like: ``How 
W Got His Groove Back''--[laughter]--``Who Moved My Presidency?'' or 
``Tuesdays With Cheney''?<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> [Laughter]
    By the way, I'm not sure whether or not Senator Obama<Obama, 
Barack<ls-thn-eq> is here. The last I heard, he was not coming to the 
Radio and TV Correspondents' dinner--not enough press. [Laughter] People 
Magazine recently had a photo of the Senator there on the beach in 
Hawaii--his sleek, hairless pecs glistening in the surf. [Laughter] It 
shows how biased the press is. Have you ever seen a shot like that of 
Denny Hastert?<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> [Laughter]
    Before I do sit down, I do want to say a couple of things. I'm very 
happy one person who could not be here last year is here tonight, and 
that's Bob Woodruff.<Woodruff, Bob<ls-thn-eq>

[[Page 357]]

Bob, we know it hasn't been easy. We admire you all the more for what 
you've overcome and what you're still overcoming.
    And, Ava<Bloom, Ava<ls-thn-eq> and Christine<Bloom, 
Christine<ls-thn-eq> and Nicole Bloom,<Bloom, Nicole<ls-thn-eq> many of 
us knew your dad. And I know life is hard without him. He was such a 
fine guy. But one thing we've all seen this evening is that he has fine 
daughters, and I know he would be really proud of you.
    Someone who is not here tonight is Tony Snow.<Snow, Tony<ls-thn-eq> 
When Tony called me and told me the outcome of his surgery, my heart 
just sank. But I know Tony is a fighter. And, Tony, we're all looking 
forward to the day when you come back to the White House.
    Last week, we all heard the news about Elizabeth Edwards,<Edwards, 
Elizabeth<ls-thn-eq> and, again, your heart just sinks for what she and 
her family faces. And so to Bob Woodruff,<Woodruff, Bob<ls-thn-eq> 
the<Bloom, Ava<ls-thn-eq> Bloom<Bloom, Christine<ls-thn-eq> 
girls,<Bloom, Nicole<ls-thn-eq> Elizabeth Edwards,<Edwards, 
Elizabeth<ls-thn-eq> Tony Snow<Snow, Tony<ls-thn-eq> and, of course, our 
men and women in uniform, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I and 
millions of other Americans are praying for you and your families.
    May God bless you, and thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 9:40 p.m. at the Washington 
Hilton Hotel. In his remarks, he referred to Brian Wilson, vice 
president and bureau chief for Washington, DC, FOX News; Helen Thomas, 
syndicated columnist, Hearst Newspapers, and member, White House press 
corps; ABC News reporter Bob Woodruff, who was injured in Iraq on 
January 29, 2006; Ava, Christine, and Nicole Bloom, daughters of former 
NBC reporter David Bloom, who died in 2003 while reporting in Iraq; and 
Elizabeth A. Edwards, wife of 2008 Presidential candidate John R. 
Edwards.
