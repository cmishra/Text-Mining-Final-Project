Statement on the Death of Gordon B. Hinckley<Hinckley, Gordon 
B.<ls-thn-eq>
January 28, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of our friend Gordon B. Hinckley. While serving for over seven decades 
in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Gordon demonstrated 
the heart of a servant and the wisdom of a leader. He was a tireless 
worker and a talented communicator who was respected in his community 
and beloved by his congregation. As president of his church, he traveled 
to more than 60 countries to spread a message of love and optimism to 
the millions of people around the world who shared his faith.
    A Mayflower descendent and the grandson of Mormon pioneers, Gordon 
was a deeply patriotic man. His leadership and service strengthened the 
board of trustees of Brigham Young University, the Boy Scouts of 
America, and the 2002 Winter Olympic games in Salt Lake City. In 2004, I 
was honored to present him with the Medal of Freedom, our Nation's 
highest civil award, in recognition of his lifelong public service.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I will miss Gordon's friendship and 
wisdom. Our thoughts and prayers are with his<Barnes, Kathleen 
H.<ls-thn-eq> five<Pearce, Virginia H.<ls-thn-eq> children<Hinckley, 
Clark B.<ls-thn-eq> and<Dudley, Jane H.<ls-thn-eq> the rest of the 
Hinckley family.

Note: The statement referred to Kathleen Barnes Walker, Virginia Pearce, 
Jane Dudley, Richard Hinckley, and Clark Hinckley, children of Mr. 
Hinckley.
