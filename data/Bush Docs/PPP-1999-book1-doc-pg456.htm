Statement on Congressional Action on the Republican Budget Proposal
March 25, 1999

    The budget that congressional Republicans passed today is a series 
of missed opportunities. It fails to lock in debt reduction, fails to 
extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, and fails to 
protect key investments for the American people--from Head Start to 
clean water and law enforcement. While this budget marks a reversal from 
last year's failed effort by Republicans to drain the entire surplus for 
a tax cut, it still does not do enough to pay down the debt and 
strengthen Social Security and Medicare.
    This year we have a unique opportunity to build on our success by 
passing a fiscally disciplined budget that pays down the debt, 
strengthens Social Security, shores up Medicare, and protects key 
investments in our children, the environment, and law enforcement. I am 
committed to accomplishing these goals to give the American people a 
budget that prepares for the future.
