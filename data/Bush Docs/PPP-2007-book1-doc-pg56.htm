Remarks Prior to a Meeting With the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Combatant 
Commanders
January 24, 2007

    It's my pleasure to welcome Secretary Gates,<Gates, Robert 
M.<ls-thn-eq> the Joint Chiefs, and the combatant commanders to the 
White House. First of all, it's an honor to be in the presence of such 
fine citizens, men who are doing their duty to protect this country. And 
we have no more solemn duty than to protect America in this war against 
extremists and radicals.
    I'm looking forward to our discussion about the theaters in which 
you are representing America. I'm looking forward to discussion about 
the new way forward in Iraq. I thank you for your service.

    I also call upon the Senate to move quickly to confirm Lieutenant 
General Petraeus<Petraeus, David H.<ls-thn-eq> as the commander of the 
Multi-National Forces--Iraq, Admiral Fallon<Fallon, William 
J.<ls-thn-eq> as the commander of Central Command, and General 
Casey<Casey, George W., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> as the Army Chief of Staff. It is 
important to get these three fine individuals in their posts as soon as 
possible so that we have continuity as we do our duty to protect the 
American people.
    We'll have a good, wide-ranging discussion here, and then 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I have the high privilege of welcoming 
you and your spouses to dinner tonight. Welcome, and thank you for 
coming.

Note: The President spoke at 5:06 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Secretary of Defense Robert M. 
Gates; Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, USA, commanding general, U.S. Army 
Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth; and Gen. George W. Casey,
