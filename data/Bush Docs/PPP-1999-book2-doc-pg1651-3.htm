Statement on Proposed Legislation on Nuclear Waste
October 1, 1999

    Yesterday's nuclear accident in Japan is a tragic reminder that we 
must do everything in our power to ensure safe, responsible handling of 
radioactive materials. Upon reviewing Senate bill 1287, regarding 
potential nuclear waste disposal at Yucca Mountain, I have determined 
that it would not adequately ensure the protection of public health and 
safety. If this bill is presented to me in its current form, I will veto 
it.
    I am encouraged that this latest Senate bill, the ``Nuclear Waste 
Policy Amendments Act of 1999,'' does not seek to authorize interim 
storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain before a thorough scientific 
analysis of the site has been completed. That would be an unconscionable 
mistake, and I have consistently opposed such proposals in the past. 
However, the bill would take away the existing authority of the 
Environmental Protection Agency to protect public

health and safety. It is vital that this authority be preserved.
    I urge the Congress to join with me in opposing this legislation and 
ensuring that we fulfill our responsibility to protect this and future 
generations.
