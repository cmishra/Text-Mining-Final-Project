Statement on the Attempted Bombing of a Family Planning Clinic in 
Asheville, North Carolina
March 13, 1999

    I was deeply disturbed to learn of the attempted bombing of a family 
planning clinic in Asheville, North Carolina. We can all be grateful 
that no one was harmed and that the clinic suffered only minor damage. 
But whether or not a terrorist's bomb achieves its deadly purpose, such 
cowardly and criminal acts strike at the heart of the constitutional 
freedoms and individual liberties all Americans hold dear. I strongly 
condemn this act of senseless violence. Federal agents are already in 
Asheville to assist local law enforcement officials. I am confident that 
the perpetrators of this terrible act will be brought to justice.
