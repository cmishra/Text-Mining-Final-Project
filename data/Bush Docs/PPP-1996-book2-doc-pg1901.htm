Statement on Signing War Crimes Document Disclosure Legislation
October 22, 1996

    I have signed into law H.R. 1281, the ``War Crimes Disclosure Act.'' 
This Act, sponsored by Representative Maloney of New York, urges United 
States Government agencies to make public any records concerning 
individuals alleged to have committed Nazi war crimes.
    My Administration is committed to ensuring the widest possible 
disclosure of government documents. On April 17, 1995, I signed 
Executive Order 12958, which will make available certain previously 
classified national security documents while safeguarding information 
critical to our Nation's security. Additionally, my Administration 
worked closely with the Congress on the recent passage of the Electronic 
Freedom of Information Act. I believe that our democratic principles 
require that the American people be informed of the activities of their 
government.
    Over half a century has passed since the conclusion of World War II 
and the end of the Holocaust, one of the most horrifying periods of 
genocide in world history. I strongly believe in the central finding of 
this Act, that it is important to learn all we can about this terrible 
era so that we can prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again. 
To that end, the Act calls for more comprehensive disclosure of 
documents specific to Nazi war crimes. It is clearly in our public 
interest to learn any remaining secrets about the Holocaust.
    I'm pleased that the Act recognizes the need not to disclose 
material that is still important to U.S. national security and law 
enforcement interests. I am hopeful that the Congress and the executive 
branch will continue to work together to balance the public interests of 
disclosing government records with the national interests of keeping 
certain documents protected.
    Ensuring a full accounting of United States records on Nazi war 
criminals is an important step in preserving the memory of those who 
died and honoring the sacrifices of those who survived. I was pleased to 
sign this bill into law.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

October 22, 1996.

Note: H.R. 1281, approved October 19, was assigned Public Law No. 104-
309.
