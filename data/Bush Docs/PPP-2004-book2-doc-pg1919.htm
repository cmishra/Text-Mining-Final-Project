Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Supplemental Budget Request To Support Comprehensive Response and 
Recovery Efforts After Hurricane Charley
September 6, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    On August 27th, I announced that I would submit a supplemental 
request to the Congress of approximately $2 billion to pay for 
comprehensive response and recovery efforts after Hurricane Charley. 
This was in addition to response and recovery efforts being undertaken 
by federal government agencies using existing resources and programs.
    Because of the severity and timing of Hurricane Frances, I ask the 
Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed request, totaling $2.0 
billion, for an emergency FY 2004 supplemental appropriation for the 
Department of Homeland Security.
    I hereby designate this proposal in the amount requested herein as 
an emergency requirement. This request responds to urgent needs 
associated with Hurricanes Charley and Frances in Florida and other 
affected areas, and will enable the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
to respond to additional disasters should they occur.
    The enclosed request requires immediate action by the Congress to 
ensure that the immediate response efforts to these recent disasters 
continue uninterrupted. I anticipate making a further request in the 
coming days that will provide for a comprehensive response and recovery 
effort addressing the impact of both of these hurricanes. In addition, 
federal government agencies will continue their response and recovery 
efforts using existing resources and programs.
    The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
