Statement on the Shootings at the Capitol
July 24, 1998

    Hillary and I were deeply disturbed to hear of the shootings this 
afternoon at the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, we extend 
our thoughts and prayers to the families of the slain officers, Jacob 
Chestnut and John Gibson, as well as to the injured victim and her 
family. The Capitol is the people's house, a place where visitors and 
workers should not have to fear violence. Every American appreciates the 
bravery of the Capitol Police who prevented further injury through their 
courageous actions.

Note: The statement referred to Angela Dickerson, who was injured during 
the incident.
