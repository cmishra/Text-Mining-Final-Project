Nomination for the Rehabilitation Services Administration
April 20, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Fredric K. 
Schroeder as Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration 
at the Department of Education.
    ``As one who gradually became blind as a teenager, Dr. Schroeder 
knows all too well the challenges facing people with disabilities,'' the 
President said. ``He has devoted his life to empowering disabled people, 
and I'm confident he will continue in his new assignment to help 
disabled Americans achieve their goals.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
