Dear _____ <ratio>
    Consistent with section 306(c)(2) of the Cuban Liberty and 
Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-114) (the 
``Act''), I hereby determine and report to the Congress that suspension 
for 6 months beyond August 1, 2006, of the right to bring an action 
under title III of the Act is necessary to the national interests of the 
United States and will expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Relations; Thad Cochran, chairman, and Robert C. Byrd, ranking member,
