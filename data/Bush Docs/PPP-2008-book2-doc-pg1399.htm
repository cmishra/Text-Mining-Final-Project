Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Mumbai, India
November 28, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened that at least 
two Americans were killed and others injured in Wednesday's horrific 
attack in Mumbai. We also mourn the great loss of life suffered by so 
many people from several other countries, and we have the wounded in our 
thoughts and prayers.
    My administration has been working with the Indian Government and 
the international community as Indian authorities work to ensure the 
safety of those still under threat. We will continue to cooperate 
against these extremists who offer nothing but violence and 
hopelessness.
