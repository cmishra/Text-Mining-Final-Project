Statement on the United Nations Security Council Resolution on Iraq
October 16, 2003

    I welcome today's unanimous passage of United Nations Security 
Council Resolution 1511. The world has an opportunity--and a 
responsibility--to help the Iraqi people build a nation that is stable, 
secure, and free. This resolution will help marshal even more 
international support for the development of a new, democratic Iraq. I 
look forward to continuing to work with the United Nations to aid the 
transition in Iraq to self-government and help the Iraqi people rebuild 
their nation.
