Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of Export Control 
Regulations
August 15, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    On August 19, 1994, in light of the expiration of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.) I 
issued Executive Order No. 12924, declaring a national emergency and 
continuing the system of export regulation under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). Under section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), the national 
emergency terminates on the anniversary date of its declaration unless 
the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmit to the 
Congress a notice of its continuation.
    I am hereby advising the Congress that I have extended the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12924. Attached is a copy of 
the notice of extension.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on August 16. 
The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
