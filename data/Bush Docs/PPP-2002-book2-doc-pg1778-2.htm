Remarks on House of Representatives Action on the Resolution Authorizing 
the Use of Military Force Against Iraq
October 10, 2002

    I would like to thank the Members of the House of Representatives, 
just as I thanked Speaker Hastert<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> and 
Leader Gephardt<Gephardt, Richard A.<ls-thn-eq> a few minutes ago, for 
the very strong bipartisan vote authorizing the use of force in Iraq if 
it becomes necessary.
    The House debate was conducted in the best traditions of the United 
States Congress. It was spirited; it was civil; and it was informed. 
This is a debate and a decision that all Americans can be proud of.
    I'm also pleased with the progress being made in the Senate, and I 
look forward to a final vote soon.
    The House of Representatives has spoken clearly to the world and to 
the United Nations Security Council: The gathering threat of Iraq must 
be confronted fully and finally. Today's vote also sends a clear message 
to the Iraqi regime: It must disarm and comply with all existing U.N. 
resolutions, or it will be forced to comply. There are no other options 
for the Iraqi regime. There can be no negotiations. The days of Iraq 
acting as an outlaw state are coming to an end.
    The United States is committed to helping make the world more 
peaceful and more just. We are committed to freedom for all. We're also 
committed to protecting human dignity, and today's vote is an important 
step toward fulfilling those great American commitments.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 4 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White 
House.
