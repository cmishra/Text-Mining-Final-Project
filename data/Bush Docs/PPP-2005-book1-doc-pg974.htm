Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Reallocation of 
the Emergency Response Fund
June 10, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I am notifying the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds 
previously transferred from the Emergency Response Fund (ERF).
    At this time, $1.074 million of ERF funds will be reallocated within 
the Department of the Treasury to strengthen the physical protection of 
the main Treasury building.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
June 13.
