Memorandum on Absence of Federal Employees in the Aftermath of Hurricane 
Opal
October 6, 1995

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Excused Absence for Employees Affected by Hurricane Opal and 
Its Aftermath

    I am deeply concerned about the devastating losses caused by 
Hurricane Opal and the impact on the well-being and livelihood of our 
fellow Americans who have been affected by this disaster. Elements of 
the Federal Government have been mobilized to respond to this disaster.
    As part of this effort, I request the heads of executive departments 
and agencies who have Federal civilian employees in the areas des-

ignated as disaster areas because of the effects of Hurricane Opal and 
its aftermath to use their discretion to excuse from duty, without 
charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who is faced with a 
personal emergency because of this storm and who can be spared from his 
or her usual responsibilities. This policy should also be applied to any 
employee who is needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or clean-
up efforts authorized by Federal, State, or local officials having 
jurisdiction.

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on October 7.
