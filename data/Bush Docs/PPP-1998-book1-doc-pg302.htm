Letter to the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission on 
Campaign Finance Reform
February 27, 1998

Dear Chairman Kennard:<Kennard, William E.<ls-thn-eq>
    Yesterday's defeat of comprehensive campaign finance reform 
legislation in the Senate makes it even more imperative that the Federal 
Communications Commission act to provide free and reduced rate airtime 
to candidates and take any other steps that would reform political 
debate over the public airwaves.
    I applaud your previous decision to take the next steps toward 
providing such free and reduced rate time. The issues surrounding such a 
proposal are complex; there are a variety of ways to proceed, and the 
views of all interested parties should be considered. But I continue to 
believe that providing such airtime is the critical next step to 
strengthen our democracy, improve our political system, and give voters 
the loudest voice.
    I strongly oppose any effort in the Congress to block your ability 
to take the next important steps for reform. Yesterday's defeat means 
that it will be virtually impossible for the Congress to move forward on 
campaign finance reform. The Congress should not make matters worse by 
actively blocking your progress.
    The most realistic next steps for reform will come from the actions 
of regulatory agencies, acting within their legal authority, to renew 
our democracy. I thank you for your leadership and pledge to work with 
you as you move forward.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton
