Statement on the Situation in Georgia
August 25, 2008

    I am deeply concerned by today's appeal to President 
Medvedev<Medvedev, Dmitry A.<ls-thn-eq> by Russia's Federation Council 
and Duma, the upper and lower houses of Russia's parliament, to 
recognize the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as 
independent countries. I call on Russia's leadership to meet its 
commitments and not recognize these separatist regions.
    Georgia's territorial integrity and borders must command the same 
respect as every other nation's, including Russia's. Russia agreed, when 
President Medvedev<Medvedev, Dmitry A.<ls-thn-eq> signed the French-
brokered cease-fire agreement, to the opening of international 
discussions on security and stability modalities in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia. This represents an internationally endorsed approach to these 
issues, which recognition would undercut. Recognition would also be 
inconsistent with unanimously approved United Nations Security 
resolutions that Russia has consistently voted for in the past.

    The United States will continue to stand with the people of Georgia 
and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial 
integrity.

Note: The statement referred to President Dmitry A. Medvedev of Russia.
