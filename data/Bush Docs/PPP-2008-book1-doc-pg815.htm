The President's Radio Address
June 14, 2008

    Good morning. This week, I'm traveling in Europe. In the past few 
days, I have visited Slovenia, Germany, Italy, and the Vatican. I'm 
spending this Saturday in France, and I will conclude my trip in the 
United Kingdom.
    In my meetings, I've discussed our shared efforts to advance peace 
and prosperity around the world. America has strong partners in leaders 
like Italy's Silvio Berlusconi,<Berlusconi, Silvio<ls-thn-eq> Germany's 
Angela Merkel,<Merkel, Angela<ls-thn-eq> France's Nicolas 
Sarkozy,<Sarkozy, Nicolas<ls-thn-eq> and Britain's Gordon Brown.<Brown, 
Gordon<ls-thn-eq> And together we're pursuing an agenda that is broad 
and far reaching.
    America and Europe are cooperating to open new opportunities for 
trade and investment. We're working to tear down regulatory barriers 
that hurt our businesses and consumers. We're striving to make this the 
year that the world completes an ambitious Doha trade agreement, which 
will open up new markets for American goods and services and help 
alleviate poverty around the world.
    America and Europe are cooperating to address the twin challenges of 
energy security and climate change, while keeping our economies strong. 
We're working to diversify our energy supplies by developing and 
financing new clean energy technologies. And we're working toward an 
international agreement that commits every major economy to slow, stop, 
and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases.
    America and Europe are cooperating to widen the circle of 
development and prosperity. We're leading the world in providing food 
aid, improving education for boys and girls, and fighting disease. 
Through the historic commitments of the United States and other G-8 
countries, we're working to turn the tide against HIV/AIDS and malaria 
in Africa. And to achieve this noble goal, all nations must keep their 
promises to deliver this urgent aid.
    America and Europe are cooperating on our most solemn duty: 
protecting our citizens. Our nations are applying the tools of 
intelligence, finance, law enforcement, diplomacy, and when necessary, 
military power to break up terror networks and deny them safe havens. 
And to protect against the prospect of ballistic missile attacks 
emanating from the Middle East, we're developing a shared system of 
missile defense.
    We're also working together to ensure that Iran is not allowed to 
acquire a nuclear weapon. This week, America and our European allies 
sent a clear and unmistakable message to the regime in Tehran: It must 
verifiably suspend its enrichment activities or face further isolation 
and additional sanctions. Together, America and Europe are pursuing 
strong diplomacy with Iran, so that future generations can look back and 
say that we came together to stop this threat to our people.
    In the long run, the most important way we can protect our people is 
to defeat the terrorists' hateful ideology by spreading the hope of 
freedom. So America and Europe are working together to advance the 
vision of two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by 
side in security and peace. We're working together to protect the 
sovereignty of Lebanon's young democracy. And we're working together to 
strengthen the democratically elected Governments in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.
    In all of these areas, the United States and Europe have agreed that 
we must take action and that we must go forward together. The level and 
breadth of the cooperation between America and our European allies today 
is unprecedented. And together we're making the world a safer and more 
hopeful place.
    Thank you for listening.
