Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting on the Deployment of United 
States Forces for Stabilization of Areas of the Former Yugoslavia
January 25, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In my report to the Congress of July 19, 1999, I provided further 
information on the deployment of combat-equipped U.S. Armed Forces to 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and other states in the region in order to 
participate in and support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO)-led Stabilization Force (SFOR), which began its mission and 
assumed authority from the NATO-led Implementation Force on December 20, 
1996. I am providing this supplemental report, consistent with the War 
Powers Resolution, to help ensure that the Congress is kept fully 
informed on continued U.S. contributions in support of peacekeeping 
efforts in the former Yugoslavia.
    The U.N. Security Council authorized member states to continue SFOR 
for a period of 12 months in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1247 of 
June 18, 1999. The mission of SFOR is to provide a continued military 
presence in order to deter hostilities, stabilize and consolidate the 
peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, contribute to a secure environment, and 
provide, within its means and capabilities, selective support to key 
areas and key civil implementation organizations.
    The U.S. force contribution to SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina is in 
the process of being

reduced from approximately 6,200 to 4,600 personnel. In the second half 
of 1999, all NATO nations and 19 others, including Russia and Ukraine, 
have provided military personnel or other support to SFOR. Most U.S. 
forces are assigned to Multinational Division, North, centered around 
the city of Tuzla. In addition, approximately 1,500 U.S. military 
personnel are deployed to Hungary, Croatia, and Italy in order to 
provide logistical and other support to SFOR. The U.S. forces continue 
to support SFOR in efforts to apprehend persons indicted for war crimes. 
In the last 6 months, U.S. forces have sustained no combat-related 
fatalities.
    I have directed the participation of U.S. Armed Forces in these 
operations pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. 
foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, and in 
accordance with various statutory authorities.
    I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the 
Congress fully informed about developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
other states in the region. I will continue to consult closely with the 
Congress regarding our efforts to foster peace and stability in the 
former Yugoslavia.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Strom Thurmond, President pro tempore of 
the Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on January 27.
