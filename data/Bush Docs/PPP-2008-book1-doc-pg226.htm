Remarks at a State Dinner Hosted by President Jakaya Mrisho 
Kikwete<Kikwete, Jakaya Mrisho<ls-thn-eq> of Tanzania in Dar es Salaam
February 17, 2008

    President Bush. Mr. President, thank you very much, sir, for your 
gracious and warm hospitality. Madam,<Kikwete, Salma<ls-thn-eq> thank 
you very much. Mr. President, thank you for coming back from Germany 
today. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are touched. This has been a 
spectacular trip. It's not over, because tomorrow we're going to tour 
more of your country.
    President Kikwete. You'll be----
    President Bush. I'll be--[laughter]. But I must say that our trip 
here has exceeded my expectations. I knew you were an accomplished 
Government. After all, you've dramatically reduced malaria; you're in 
the process of dramatically reducing HIV/AIDS. My country has awarded 
you the largest Millennium Challenge grant ever in the history of our 
Nation, all because your Government is committed to honest, decent 
government for the people.
    I have been extremely touched, as has Laura,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
by the outpouring of support by the great people of Tanzania. And so, 
Mr. President, I too would like to propose a toast: To you and your 
family, to the people of Tanzania, and to our friendship, may it be long 
lasting.

Note: The President spoke at 6:58 p.m. at the State House. In his 
remarks, he referred to Mama Salma Kikwete, wife of President Kikwete. 
The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also 
included the remarks of President Kikwete. A tape was not available for 
the verification of the content of these remarks.
