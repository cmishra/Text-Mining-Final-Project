Statement on the Death of Les Aspin
May 21, 1995

    I speak for millions of Americans when mourning the death today of 
Les Aspin and join many others in saying that he was my friend.
    As a Member of the House of Representatives for 22 years, chairman 
of the House Armed Services Committee for 8, Secretary of Defense, and 
Chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, Les 
rendered our Nation extraordinary, selfless service.
    Les Aspin accomplished greatly because he cared greatly. He brought 
the same commitment to his most recent assignment that he brought to 
Washington as a young congressional aide, staff assistant at the Council 
of Economic Advisers, and Defense Department official in the 1960's.
    No one knew better than he how Washington works, but he never 
thought of it as a game for its own sake. He was here to make a 
difference. And he did. He probed and helped

shape a generation of American defense policies and budgets, culminating 
in the decisive bottom-up review of our military strategy, which he 
conducted as Secretary of Defense.
    Les Aspin was unique. He brought the light of his joy in living and 
the heat of his intellect to every occasion. He never met a person who 
didn't like him. And we all will miss him.
