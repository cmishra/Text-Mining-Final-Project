Statement on Funding To Hire Highly Qualified Teachers
June 30, 2000

    Today Secretary Riley<Riley, Richard W.> announced the 
award of $1.3 billion to continue on the path to hiring 100,000 new, 
highly qualified teachers as part of my class size reduction program. 
These funds will allow States to place more high-quality teachers in 
smaller classes in the early grades, so that approximately 1.7 million 
children can receive the personal and academic support they need. The 
Vice President and I have a longstanding commitment to ensure that all 
children have access to a first-class education, and these grants 
provide support to State and local communities to work toward this goal 
by investing in what works. Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress are 
rejecting this proven strategy of investing in what works and insisting 
on accountability for results, in favor of unfocused block grants with 
little or no accountability. I urge Congress to reverse its recent 
actions and enact full funding to reduce class sizes in the early 
grades, strengthen accountability and turn around failing schools, 
expand before-school and after-school opportunities, assist low-income 
students in preparing for college, help bridge the digital divide, 
improve teacher quality, and expand English language/civics education 
programs for adults.
