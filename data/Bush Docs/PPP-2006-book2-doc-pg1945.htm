Joint Statement by President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Nuri al-
Maliki<Maliki, Nuri al-<ls-thn-eq> of Iraq
October 28, 2006

    We were pleased to continue our consultations today. Via secure 
video, we discussed a range of issues of great importance to our common 
mission in Iraq, including the development of Iraqi security forces, 
efforts to promote reconciliation among all Iraqis, and the 
International Compact for Iraq and the economic reforms associated with 
it. As leaders of two great countries, we are committed to the security 
and prosperity of a democratic Iraq and the global fight against 
terrorism which affects all our citizens.
    We have three common goals: accelerating the pace of training the 
Iraqi Security Force, Iraqi assumption of command and control over Iraqi 
forces, and transferring responsibility for security to the Government 
of Iraq. We have formed a high-level working group including the Iraqi 
National Security Advisor,<Rubaie, Mouwafak al-<ls-thn-eq> Minister of 
Defense,<Mufriji, Abd al-Qadir al-<ls-thn-eq> Minister of 
Interior,<Bulani, Jawad al-<ls-thn-eq> General Casey,<Casey, George W., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and Ambassador Khalilzad<Khalilzad, Zalmay<ls-thn-eq> to 
make recommendations on how these goals can be best achieved. This 
working group will supplement existing mechanisms to better define our 
security partnership and enhance our coordination.
    We are committed to the partnership our two countries and two 
governments have

formed and will work in every way possible for a stable, democratic Iraq 
and for victory in the war on terror.
