Nomination for Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human 
Services
April 1, 1993

    The President announced today that he will nominate June Gibbs 
Brown, a former Inspector General at the Department of Defense, NASA, 
and the Department of the Interior, to be Inspector General of the 
Department of Health and Human Services.
    ``HHS is the biggest civilian Agency of the Federal Government,'' 
said the President, ``and it is imperative that it be managed as 
efficiently as possible. That is one of the central tasks that Secretary 
Shalala has taken on, and I am very pleased to be nominating someone of 
June Gibbs Brown's stature as Inspector General.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
