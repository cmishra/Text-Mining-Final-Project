Statement on the National Economy
April 30, 1999

    Today we received more good news for America's working families 
about our economy. In the first quarter of this year, the U.S. economy 
expanded at a robust 4.5 percent annual rate. Driven by high investment 
and vigorous consumer demand, America's expansion continues to grow 
steady and strong.
    Strong growth, high investment, low inflation, and low unemployment 
are a winning combination and more evidence that we should stick with an 
economic strategy that has helped usher in a new era of prosperity for 
the American people.
