Remarks Following a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
September 7, 2001

    Thank you all for coming. Today, visiting with the Speaker and the 
Leader, it's the end of a long week of discussing how to make sure our 
economy begins to grow again.
    I want to appreciate Denny<Hastert, J. Dennis> and 
Trent<Lott, Trent> for coming down again. They've been 
visiting with their Members, and I've been visiting with them and their 
Members. I also had a good discussion today with Minority Leader 
Gephardt<Gephardt, Richard A.> and, of course, Senate Majority 
Leader Daschle<Daschle, Thomas A.> the other day, as well, 
about how we can kind of get away from all the distractions that tend to 
dominate Washington and focus on a pro-growth agenda for this fall.
    The unemployment numbers today are evidence that I've seen firsthand 
as I travel the country, and that is, too many people are losing their 
jobs as a result of a slowdown that began when Dick<Cheney, 
Dick> and I were campaigning across our country last summer. 
This slowdown is real, and it's affecting too many lives, and we're 
concerned about it.
    Any American out of work is too many Americans out of work. And 
that's why it's absolutely essential that we work together to put a 
growth plan in place to create jobs for hard-working Americans. It 
starts with having a responsible budget that meets our Nation's 
obligations without affecting Social Security or dipping into Social 
Security.
    We made a great step toward economic growth when we worked together 
to pass tax relief. One-half of the checks have gone out; more relief is 
on the way this fall, which should help our economy. Beginning in 
January 1st, Americans will see lower tax rates, lower withholding from 
their paychecks, and a larger tax credit.
    Tax relief is just now making its way in the economy, and there are 
some, it seems like, who are beginning to say, ``Maybe we ought to raise 
taxes.'' But I can assure you, the four of us on this stage are not 
going to let anybody pick the pockets of the American taxpayer.
    To help get our economy moving again, Congress needs to enact an 
energy plan which will lower energy costs and create jobs. To get the 
economy moving again, Congress needs to enact trade promotion authority, 
so we can open up new markets for American products.
    We've got a plan to get our economy moving so Americans can find 
work. And today I want to thank the leadership of the Congress from the 
Republican side that came and strategized with the Vice 
President<Cheney, Dick> and me as how to get this plan moving. 
I want the American people to know we're deeply concerned about the 
unemployment rates, and we intend to do something about it.
    Thank you all very much.

Note: The exchange began at 3:07 p.m. on the South Grounds of the White 
House.
