Statement on the Bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, Iraq
February 22, 2006

    On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest condolences to 
the people of Iraq for the brutal bombing of the Golden Mosque in 
Samarra, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam. The terrorists in Iraq 
have again proven that they are enemies of all faiths and of all 
humanity. The world must stand united against them and steadfast behind 
the people of Iraq. This senseless crime is an affront to people of 
faith throughout the world. The United States condemns this cowardly act 
in the strongest possible terms.
    I ask all Iraqis to exercise restraint in the wake of this tragedy 
and to pursue justice in accordance with the laws and Constitution of 
Iraq. Violence will only contribute to what the terrorists sought to 
achieve by this act.
    The United States stands ready to do all in its power to assist the 
Government of Iraq to identify and bring to justice those responsible 
for this terrible act. And the American people pledge to work with the 
people of Iraq to rebuild and restore the Golden Mosque of Samarra to 
its former glory.
