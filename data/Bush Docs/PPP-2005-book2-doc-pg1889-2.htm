Statement on the Inauguration of the Afghan National Assembly
December 19, 2005

    I congratulate the Afghan people on the inauguration of the new 
Afghan national assembly. Today is another milestone in Afghanistan's 
historic transition to a stable and democratic state governed by the 
rule of law. A freely and fairly elected legislature plays a vital role 
in the life of a representative democracy. I applaud the members of the 
national assembly on their service to their country and support their 
efforts, with President Karzai<Karzai, Hamid<ls-thn-eq> and his 
Government, to improve the lives of the Afghan people.
