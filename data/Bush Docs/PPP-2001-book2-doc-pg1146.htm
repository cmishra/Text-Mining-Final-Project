Statement on Signing the Air Transportation Safety and System 
Stabilization Act
September 22, 2001

    Today I signed the Airline Transportation and Systems Stabilization 
Act, which will provide urgently needed tools to assure the safety and 
immediate stability of our Nation's commercial airline system. This 
important legislation also establishes a process for compensating 
victims of the terrorist attacks.
    The terrorists who attacked our country on September 11th will not 
shut down our vital businesses or thwart our way of life. I commend the 
Congress for their cooperation and quick action in passing responsible 
legislation that will improve passenger safety, help the victims and 
their loved ones, and keep America's airplanes flying while the airlines 
develop long-term viability plans.

Note: H.R. 2926, approved September 22, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
42.
