Statement on the Earth Observation Summit
July 31, 2003

    The United States is pleased to host more than 30 nations at the 
Earth Observation Summit. The Summit participants will discuss plans for 
achieving the goal of building a better integrated Earth observation 
system in the next 10 years, an objective established by the G-8 heads 
of state in Evian, France, in June 2003. An integrated Earth observation 
system will benefit people around the world, particularly those in the 
Southern Hemisphere. Working together, our nations will develop and link 
observation technologies for tracking weather and climate changes in 
every corner of the world, which will allow us to make more informed 
decisions affecting our environment and economies. Our cooperation will 
enable us to develop the capability to predict droughts, prepare for 
weather emergencies, plan and protect crops, manage coastal areas and 
fisheries, and monitor air quality.
