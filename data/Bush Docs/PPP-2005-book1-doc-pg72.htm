Statement on the Death of Johnny Carson<Carson, John W. 
``Johnny''<ls-thn-eq>
January 23, 2005

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by the death of 
Johnny Carson. Born in Iowa and raised in Nebraska, Johnny Carson was a 
steady and reassuring presence in homes across America for three 
decades. His wit and insight made Americans laugh and think and had a 
profound influence on American life and entertainment. He was a patriot 
who served in the United States Navy during World War II and always 
remembered his roots in the heartland of America. We send our prayers 
and condolences to the entire Carson family.
