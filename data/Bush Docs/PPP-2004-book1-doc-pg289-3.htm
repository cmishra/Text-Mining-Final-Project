Message to the Congress on Extending Generalized System of Preferences 
Benefits to Algeria and Terminating Benefits of Certain Other Countries
March 1, 2004

To the Congress of the United States:
    Consistent with section 502(f) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
(the ``Act''), I am writing to inform you of my intent to designate 
Algeria as a beneficiary developing country and to terminate the 
designation of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahrain, the Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia as 
beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP).

    I have considered the criteria set forth in sections 501 and 502 of 
the Act. In light of these criteria, I have determined that it is 
appropriate to extend GSP benefits to Algeria. I have also determined 
that Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, and Bahrain have become ``high 
income'' countries, and I therefore terminate their designation as 
beneficiary developing countries effective January 1, 2006. Furthermore, 
consistent with the Act's prohibition on designation of European Union 
member states as beneficiary developing countries, I am terminating such 
designation for the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Poland, and Slovakia when they become European Union member states.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 March 1, 2004.

Note: The related proclamation of March 1 is listed in Appendix D at the 
end of this volume.
