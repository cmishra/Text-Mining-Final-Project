Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on the Georgia Congressional 
Redistricting Case
June 29, 1995

    I am disappointed by the Supreme Court decision in the Georgia 
congressional redistricting case. The decision is a setback in the 
struggle to ensure that all Americans participate fully in the electoral 
process, and it threatens to undermine the promise of the Voting Rights 
Act.
    My administration remains firmly committed to full enforcement of 
the Voting Rights Act. We will continue working to ensure that minority 
citizens in racially polarized areas have an effective remedy against 
the unlawful dilution of their votes and against impairment of their 
ability to participate in the electoral process. Congress, on a 
bipartisan basis, passed the Voting Rights Act to fulfill the 
constitutional guarantees of full political rights for all citizens, 
regardless of race. The Justice Department will continue its vigorous 
enforcement of the law.
    We have traveled a long road to fulfill the promise of political 
rights for all citizens. Today is a difficult day on that journey, but 
the road does not end here. While the ruling in the Georgia case is 
unfortunate, I am gratified that the Court's statements and actions make 
clear that race properly may be considered in the drawing of legislative 
districts.
    Despite today's setback, we will not let this decision turn back the 
clock. We will not abandon those citizens who look to the Voting Rights 
Act to protect their constitutional rights.
