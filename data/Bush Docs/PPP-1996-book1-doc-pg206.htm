Message to the Congress Transmitting the Poland-United States
Fisheries Agreement Extension
February 9, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement 
between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Republic of Poland Extending the Agreement of August 
1, 1985, as amended, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United 
States (``the 1985 Agreement''). The Agreement, which was effected by an 
exchange of notes at Warsaw on December 15 and 20, 1995, extends the 
1985 Agreement to December 31, 1997.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Poland, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 9, 1996.
