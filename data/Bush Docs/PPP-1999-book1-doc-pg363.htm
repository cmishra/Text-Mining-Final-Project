Statement on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as 
Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
March 12, 1999

    I welcome the accession today of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech 
Republic as NATO's newest members. The people of these three nations 
know what it means to lose their freedom. For years they struggled with 
dignity and courage to regain their freedom. And now they will help us 
defend it for many years to come. Their membership will make America 
safer. It will make NATO stronger. And it will help us realize our 
common vision of a Europe that is for the first time undivided, 
democratic, and at peace.
    For 3 days, beginning on April 23, NATO's 19 members will meet in 
Washington for the 50th anniversary summit of our alliance, joined by 
our partners from across the new Europe. We will honor NATO's 
achievements in protecting peace and security. We will also prepare our 
alliance to meet the challenges ahead, strengthen our partnership with 
Europe's newly democratic nations, and reaffirm our commitment that 
NATO's newest members will not be the last.
