Statement on the Death of Lady Bird Johnson<Johnson, Claudia A. ``Lady 
Bird''<ls-thn-eq>
July 11, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I mourn the passing of our good 
friend and a warm and gracious woman, Lady Bird Johnson. Those who were 
blessed to know her remember Mrs. Johnson's lively and charming 
personality, and our Nation will always remember her with affection. 
Mrs. Johnson became First Lady on a fateful day in November 1963 and was 
a steady, gentle presence for a mourning nation in the days that 
followed.
    In the White House, Mrs. Johnson shared her love of the environment 
and nature with our entire country. The native wildflowers that bloom 
along roadsides today are part of her lasting legacy. She joined 
President Johnson in the struggle for civil rights, inspiring millions 
of Americans. Her commitment to early education gave many children a 
head start in life.
    President Johnson once called her a woman of ``ideals, principles, 
intelligence, and refinement.'' She remained so throughout their life 
together and in the many years given to her afterward. She was

much-loved in our home State of Texas, and the Bush family is fortunate 
to have known her.
    Lady Bird Johnson leaves behind her devoted daughters, Lynda<Robb, 
Lynda Bird Johnson<ls-thn-eq> and Luci,<Turpin, Luci Baines 
Johnson<ls-thn-eq> their fine families, and a nation that joins them in 
honoring a good life of kindness and service.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement. The Death of Lady Bird Johnson proclamation 
is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
