Message on the Observance of the 25th Anniversary of the Pontificate of 
His Holiness John Paul II<Pope John Paul II<ls-thn-eq>
October 16, 2003

    I send greetings to those gathered to celebrate the 25th Anniversary 
of the Pontificate of His Holiness John Paul II.
    As a priest, chaplain, professor, Auxiliary Bishop, Archbishop, 
Cardinal, and Pope, His Holiness has spent a lifetime sharing God's 
teachings and ministering to those in need. He has put hope in people's 
hearts and inspired acts of goodness and compassion. For the past 25 
years, His Holiness has led worldwide efforts to develop a new culture 
of life that values and protects the lives of innocent children waiting 
to be born. He has also brought the love of the Almighty to people of 
all ages, particularly those who suffer or live in poverty, or who are 
weak and vulnerable. Pope John Paul II has shown the world not only the 
splendor of truth, but also the power of truth to overcome evil and to 
redirect the course of history.

    The United States and the world are better because of his dedication 
to sharing his wisdom, guidance, and faith. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
joins me in sending our best wishes on this special occasion.

                                                          George W. Bush
