Statement on Proposed Tobacco Legislation
September 11, 2000

    Today researchers are releasing two important studies that remind us 
why we must act quickly to protect young people from the dangers of 
tobacco.
    According to an NIH-funded study in the September issue of Tobacco 
Control, children become addicted to nicotine more readily than 
researchers previously suspected. The study shows that kids do not need 
to smoke every day before they become dependent on nicotine--even 
adolescents who smoke as little as once a month experience symptoms of 
addiction. And because we already know that at least one third of the 
children who get hooked will have their lives cut short as a result, the 
national consequences are devastating. Another study released today in 
the September issue of Preventive Medicine underscores the effectiveness 
of price increases as part of any comprehensive effort, especially among 
young people--up to 2.3 million lives could be saved over the next 40 
years by a $1.00 per pack inflation-adjusted price increase alone.
    These studies today show why Congress must join Vice President Gore 
and me in making the health of our children a priority. Today I renew my 
call to Congress to affirm the FDA's authority to limit tobacco 
marketing and sales to youth and fund the Clinton-Gore administration's 
tobacco-related budget proposals. I also urge Congress to reject special 
interest protections for big tobacco by letting the American taxpayers, 
who have spent billions in tobacco-related Federal health costs, finally 
have their day in court. By working together, we can improve our 
Nation's health and save children's lives.

Note: This statement was embargoed for release until 7 p.m.
