Memorandum on Federal Support for the AbilityOne Program
February 11, 2008

 Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Federal Support for the AbilityOne Program

    Americans with disabilities make valuable contributions to our 
country's workforce that help keep our Nation the world's economic 
leader. Expanding employment opportunities for these individuals will 
help ensure that our economy is drawing on the talents and creativity of 
all its citizens and that America remains a place of opportunity for 
all. Supporting the AbilityOne Program is one good way to achieve this 
goal.
    The AbilityOne Program (formerly the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program) is 
a Federal initiative that works with public and private organizations to 
generate employment opportunities for Americans who are blind or have 
other disabilities. Nearly 43,000 individuals work in more than 600 
community-based nonprofit agencies that serve people with a wide range 
of disabilities and sell products and services to the Federal Government 
through the AbilityOne Program.
    The AbilityOne Program has taken steps to embrace successful 
business practices, including e-commerce and performance-based 
contracting. Strong support from Federal customers is critical to 
fulfilling this important program's employment mission. Therefore, I 
encourage you to ensure that your agency's procurement officials acquire 
products and services provided by the AbilityOne Program, consistent 
with existing law.
    Additional information about the AbilityOne Program may be obtained 
by contacting the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled or by visiting www.AbilityOne.gov.

                                                          George W. Bush
