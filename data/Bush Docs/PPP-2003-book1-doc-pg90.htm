Message on the Observance of the Lunar New Year
January 22, 2003

    I send greetings to those celebrating the Lunar New Year, the Year 
of the Goat.
    The Lunar New Year has traditionally celebrated the rejuvenation of 
the earth and the start of the new farm season. Today, for many Asian 
Americans it represents a period of new beginnings and renewed hope. 
During this time, individuals around the world reaffirm the value of 
friendship, celebrate family, and look forward to a hopeful future.
    As our Nation continues to welcome new opportunities and face new 
challenges, the Lunar New Year reflects our country's ongoing dedication 
to affirming the vitality of our traditions, strengthening our 
relationships with our neighbors, and building a peaceful, more 
prosperous future for all.
    Laura<Bush, Laura> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
peace, health, and happiness in the New Year.

                                                          George W. Bush
