Statement on National Science Policy
August 3, 1994

    The return from our public investment in fundamental science has 
been enormous. The principal sponsors and beneficiaries are the American 
people. Our scientific investments are an important national resource 
which we must sustain and build on for the future.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the release of the national science policy report, ``Science in the 
National Interest.''
