Message to the Senate Transmitting a Protocol to the Canada-United 
States Taxation Convention
September 23, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of 
America and Canada with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Signed 
at Washington on September 26, 1980 as Amended by the Protocols Signed 
on June 14, 1983, March 28, 1984 and March 17, 1995, signed at Ottawa on 
July 29, 1997. This Protocol modified the taxation of social security 
benefits and the taxation of gains from the sale of shares of foreign 
real-property holding companies.

    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
