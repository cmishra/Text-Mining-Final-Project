Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
July 30, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period April 1 to May 31, 1998. The 
previous submission covered events during February and March 1998.
    My Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus, Ambassador Richard C. 
Holbrooke, accompanied by Special Cyprus Coordinator Ambassador Thomas 
J. Miller, traveled to Cyprus in early April and held a series of 
intensive talks with the leaders of both communities. In early May, they 
returned to the island at the request of both leaders and encouraged 
them to begin

serious negotiations toward a bizonal, bicommunal federation. 
Unfortunately, the Turkish side took the position that talks could not 
begin unless certain preconditions were satisfied, including recognition 
of the ``Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus'' and the withdrawal of 
Cyprus' application to the European Union.
    Although progress was not possible during Ambassador Holbrooke's May 
visit, he assured both parties that the United States would remain 
engaged in the search for a solution.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
