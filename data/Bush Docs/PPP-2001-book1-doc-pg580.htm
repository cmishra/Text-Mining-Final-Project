Statement on Congressional Action on Tax Relief Legislation
May 25, 2001

    As a result of this landmark tax relief agreement, the American 
taxpayers will have more money in their pockets to save and invest, and 
the economy will receive a much-needed shot in the arm. I commend the 
Members of the House and Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, who made 
this happen. Tax relief is a centerpiece of our American agenda, and I 
look forward to signing it into law.
