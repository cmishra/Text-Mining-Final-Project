                               Foreword

 This volume collects my speeches and papers from the first 6 months
of 2005. This was the start of my second term as President. It was
also a time of peril and promise across the world.

 As the year began, America continued to aid millions reeling from
the historic tsunami that struck countries on the coast of the Indian
Ocean on December 26, 2004. United States military assets-including
the hospital ship USNS Mercy-moved to the region to aid in the
recovery and rebuilding. The American people once again showed the
good and compassionate heart of our Nation by contributing generously
to relief efforts.

 On January 20, I placed my hand on the Bible and took the Oath of
Office for the second time. In my Inaugural Address, I set America
toward a goal worthy of a great Nation: ``to seek and support the
growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and
culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.'' I
said that the only force of history that can break the reign of
hatred and resentment is the force of human freedom. I further
stated: ``The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on
the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our
world is the expansion of freedom in all the world''
 
 That same month, millions of Iraqis defied threats of violence to
exercise their newly won right to vote in elections for the Iraqi
National Assembly. The new Iraqi Assembly elected an interim prime
minister and president, moving the country closer to the goal of
becoming a stable democracy. Our men and women in uniform continued
to help the people of Iraq-and Afghanistan as well-performing their
duties with courage and honor. In April, it was my privilege to award
the first Medal of Honor in the Global War on Terror to Sergeant
First Class Paul R. Smith, U.S. Army-a brave soldier from Tampa,
Florida, who saved the life of his men by giving his own.
 
 As we confronted challenges abroad, we also worked to address
concerns here at home. In my State of the Union Message, I challenged
the Congress to bolster America's economic growth by making the tax
cuts we passed permanent. I outlined my vision for immigration reform
and border security, and I urged members of both parties to put
political considerations aside to reform and strengthen the Social
Security system. I said, ``Social Security was a great moral success
of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new
century. The system, however, on its current path, is headed toward
bankruptcy. And so we must join together to strengthen and save
Social Security.'' In the ensuing months, I traveled across our
country to make the case for steps to protect Social Security for our
seniors and


[[Page vi]]

for future generations. Unfortunately, the Congress did not heed this
call, and I hope that a future Congress finds the courage to enact
meaningful reform.

 This was also a time when our Nation stregthened its relationships
with our friends across the world. I met with two of our closest
allies in the Western hemisphere-the leaders of Canada and Mexico-to
discuss trade, immigration, and security. I welcomed leaders from
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority to
discuss efforts to establish a lasting Middle East peace. I traveled
to Rome to attend the funeral of one of the great world leaders of
our age, a humble servant of God-Pope John Paul II. In June, I hosted
a summit between the United States and our partners in the European
Union, pledging to stop the proliferation of the world�s most
dangerous weapons and to work together to stop the advance of
terrorism and extremism.

 As the first 6 months of the year drew to a close, I was preparing
for the G-8 summit in Scotland and outlining abmitious plans to
combat malaria in Africa and provide better educational opportunities
for African children; the United States and other nations were
working with Afghans and Iraqis to continue the difficulty work of
transition to full and stable democracies; and our country remained
vigilant against further attacks on our homeland.

                              Preface

 This book contains the papers and speeches of the 43d President of
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press
Secretary during the period January 1-June 30, 2005. The material has
been compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register,
National Archives and Records Administration.

 The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates shown
in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been
made to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape
recording, and signed documents are checked against the original.
Textnotes and cross references have been provided by the editors for
purposes of identification or clarity. At the request of the Office
of the Press Secretary, the Bush property known as Prairie Chapel
Ranch in Crawford, Texas, is referred to simply as the Bush Ranch.
Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, unless indicated. The
times noted are local times. All materials that are printed full-text
in the book have been indexed in the subject and name indexes, and
listed in the document categories list.

 The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D.
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896
and 1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued,
but there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional
Record or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential
papers could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House
releases or as reported in the press. The Commission therefore
recommended the establishment of an official series in which
Presidential writings, addresses, and remarks of a public nature
could be made available.

 The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

  A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to
meet the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the
administration of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its
coverage to include additional material as printed in the Weekly
Compilation. That coverage provides a listing of the President's
daily schedule and meetings, when announced, and other items of
general interest issued by the Office of


[[Page viii]]

the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the President�s
nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by the Office
of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the book, and
proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential documents
released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in the
Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the
end of the book.

  Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Herbert Hoover,
Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B.
Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan,
George Bush, and William J. Clinton are also included in the Public
Papers series.
 
  The Public Papers of the Presidents publication program is under the
direction of Frances D. McDonald, Managing Editor, Office of the
Federal Register. The series is produced by the Presidential and
Legislative Publications Unit, Gwendolyn J. Henderson, Chief. The
Chief Editor of this book was Stacey A. Mulligan, assisted by
William K. Banks, Loretta F. Cochran, Kathleen M. Fargey, Stephen J.
Frattini, Michael J. Forcina, Allison M. Gavin, Diane Hiltabidle,
Alfred Jones, Heather McDaniel, Ashley Merusi, Jennifer Partridge,
Matthew Regan, Michael J. Sullivan, and Brian Swidal.
 
  The frontispiece and photographs used in the portfolio were supplied
by the White House Photo Office. The typography and design of the
book were developed by the Government Printing Office under the
direction of Robert C. Tapella, Public Printer.
