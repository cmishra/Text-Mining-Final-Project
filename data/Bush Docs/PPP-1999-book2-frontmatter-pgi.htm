                                Foreword

    In the second half of 1999, the Nation's attention turned to meeting 
the challenges of a new millennium--and seizing the opportunities 
presented by our strong and growing economy.

    Our economic expansion continued to set records as the longest in 
America's peacetime history. The number of new jobs created since 1993 
passed the 20 million mark, as unemployment reached its lowest level in 
20 years, and unemployment among African-Americans and Hispanics fell to 
record lows. At the same time, America experienced the fastest and 
longest growth of real wages in two decades--and inflation fell to its 
lowest level since the 1960s. We achieved our first back-to-back budget 
surpluses in 42 years.

    With support from Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, I 
launched a New Markets Initiative, to reach those parts of America that 
economic growth has passed by. We began with the principle that, just as 
we give companies incentives to invest in developing markets overseas, 
we should give them incentives to invest in inner cities, poor rural 
areas, and Native American reservations right here in America. As I 
traveled from Watts to the Mississippi Delta to the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation, I met a stream of talented people, eager for opportunity 
and ready to work. With investment incentives, loan programs, and 
support for business development, our New Markets Initiative is helping 
put them to work--and helping to keep our economy growing.

    Working with the Congress, we made a bipartisan commitment to put 
100,000 new teachers in our schools and 50,000 more police on our 
streets. We doubled funds for after-school programs. We provided, for 
the very first time ever, funds to help school districts turn around 
failing schools or shut them down. We funded 60,000 housing vouchers to 
help people move from welfare to work. Working with Senators Jeffords 
and Kennedy, we passed a bill allowing people with disabilities to move 
into the workplace and keep their government-funded health care.

    We also reaffirmed our commitment to global leadership for peace and 
freedom in the century ahead by reaching an agreement with the Congress 
to pay our arrears to the United Nations. We reached a ground-breaking 
agreement to allow China to enter the World Trade Organization in 
exchange for China's opening its markets to U.S. goods. We continued our 
efforts to promote peace in the Middle East, working to assist 
negotiations between both Israel and Syria and Israel and the 
Palestinians. We concluded the adapted Conventional Armed Forces in 
Europe Treaty, which will help ensure military stability and 
predictability in Europe; and Russia committed to withdraw its forces 
from Georgia and Moldova. We helped conclude a Caspian pipeline 
agreement to further ensure our energy security and reinforce the 
independence of the new nations of Central Asia. In our own hemisphere, 
we honored America's commitment to entrust the Panama Canal to the 
government and people of Panama. We also gave strong support to the 
democratic transitions in Nigeria and Indonesia, and we led the way in 
negotiating an historic debt relief initiative for the poorest countries 
of the developing world.

    We recommitted ourselves, as well, to meeting the challenges we face 
at the dawn of a new millennium, abroad and at home: the need to keep 
Social Security and Medicare safe and sound for future generations; the 
need to make sure the trade that keeps us prosperous becomes not just 
freer, but fairer; the need to bridge the digital divide between those 
who have and can use a computer, and those who do not or cannot; the 
need to manage the implications of new technology, new science, new ways 
of doing business. And perhaps the most important challenge of all: the 
imperative not to give in to complacency, but to use our prosperity for 
good--and for a better future.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period July 1-December 31, 1999. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush are 
also included in the Public Papers series.
