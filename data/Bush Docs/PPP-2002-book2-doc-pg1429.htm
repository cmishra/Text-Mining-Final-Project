    The United States is a leader in creating more effective ways to 
combat poverty and raise standards of living, recognizing that progress 
begins with sound domestic policies that promote good governance, 
investment in people, and economic freedom. The U.S. delegation will 
come to Johannesburg with concrete and practical proposals for strong 
and lasting partnerships to advance some of the world's key development 
priorities--clean water, modern energy, good health, and productive 
agriculture--that can lead us to a world without poverty. Poverty 
remains a huge and urgent global problem that demands action by the 
entire world community. We will stand together in Johannesburg to bring 
our full support to this important battle.
