Remarks Honoring the Super Bowl XXXV Champion Baltimore Ravens
June 7, 2001

    Thank you. Please be seated. It seems like we drew quite a crowd 
here today. It's been a big day here at the White House. I got to sign 
the most significant tax relief in a generation. [Applause] Recycling a 
few tax families here. [Laughter] Then, of course, I get the high honor 
of welcoming the Super Bowl champs, the Baltimore Ravens.
    First, I do want to thank the Members of the United States Congress 
from the State of Maryland who are here. It seems like they have got a 
particular interest in this event. Thank you all for coming. 
Cardinal,<Keeler, William Cardinal<ls-thn-eq> thank you for being here, 
as well. With you on the side of the Ravens, I can now understand why 
teams like the Cowboys didn't do very well.
    Art,<Modell, Art<ls-thn-eq> welcome, and congratulations. Some of 
you may know, or don't know, I used to be an owner in the professional 
leagues. It happened to be in baseball. I never had the thrill of 
receiving a trophy like you and your family have done. It's a great 
tribute to good ownership, to win a trophy such as this, and I 
congratulate you for being here. And I congratulate you for putting 
together a fine organization. Big Ozzie,<Newsome, Ozzie<ls-thn-eq> 
congratulations, sir. I'm your age. [Laughter] You look younger. 
[Laughter] Anyway--I also want to congratulate the coach. 
Brian,<Billick, Brian<ls-thn-eq> it's good to see you again. I think the 
players know this, that you can't win a championship without a good 
coach, without a good leader. And it's pretty hard to inspire a group of 
strong-headed, great athletes--[laughter]--but you did. I congratulate 
you.
    I want to congratulate all the players who are here. And I want to 
congratulate your families, too. It's sometimes not easy to be the wife 
of a football player or a baseball player. There's a lot of time away 
from the home. And while the players, of course, deserve the great 
credit for winning on the field, the wives deserve a lot of credit, too, 
by standing behind the players. So congratulate to the family members.
    This is a team that is blessed by five native--having five native 
Texans on the team. [Laughter] Very wise of you. [Laughter] So to my 
fellow Texans, welcome to the White House. It's good to see you. 
[Laughter]
    A couple of points I want to make. First, I realize it's been 30 
years since the Lombardi Trophy rested in Baltimore, Maryland. It's 
clear by bringing it back home, Art, that you have indelibly etched your 
team and your style and the team's culture in the hearts of the people 
of Baltimore.
    I also want to use this opportunity--as you know, I'm going over to 
Europe, and one of the discussions there in Europe will be about 
defense--[laughter]--Senator Sarbanes.<Sarbanes, Paul S.<ls-thn-eq> 
[Laughter] I think our Allies need to look at the Baltimore Ravens. 
[Laughter] They'll realize good defense wins. A good defense is one 
which adjusts to the times. A good defense is modern. A good defense is 
clear. And if Secretary Rumsfeld<Rumsfeld, Donald H.<ls-thn-eq> gets 
tired of his job, ``Secretary Marvin Lewis''<Lewis, Marvin<ls-thn-eq> 
sounds pretty good--[laughter]--Secretary of Defense. [Laughter]
    At any rate, congratulations for winning. I also want to 
congratulate Michael McCrary.<McCrary, Michael<ls-thn-eq> I do because 
he recently received the NFL Players Association highest honor of 
humanitary achievement. That's important. It's important to be a champ 
on the field, and it's important to be a champ off the field. And 
Michael, I want to thank you for your work with the Special Olympics.
    I don't know if any of you have ever had a chance to go to see the 
Special Olympics, but if you do, and somebody offers you a chance to be 
a hugger--which means you're standing on the other side

of the finish line to hug somebody who comes running across--do it. It 
touches your heart. And Michael,<McCrary, Michael<ls-thn-eq> thank you 
for that. And thank you for setting a good example.
    Thank you all for coming to the White House. Thanks for being 
champs. And on behalf of the American people, I congratulate you.

Note: The President spoke at 2:25 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to His Eminence William Cardinal 
Keeler, Archbishop of Baltimore; and owner Art Modell, vice president of 
player personnel Ozzie Newsome, head coach Brian Billick, defensive 
coordinator Marvin Lewis, and player Michael McCrary, Baltimore Ravens.
