Nomination for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
May 3, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Mary L. 
Schapiro as Chair and Commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission (CFTC). CFTC is the Federal agency charged with regulation of 
the Nation's futures markets. The President also announced his intention 
to nominate Sheila C. Bair to continue in her role as a CFTC 
Commissioner.
    ``In her years as a Commissioner with the SEC, Mary Schapiro has 
contributed an intelligent and experienced voice to the matters that 
have come before this important board. I look forward to her taking on 
this new challenge as CFTC Chairman,'' the President said.

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
