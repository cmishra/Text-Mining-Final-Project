The President's Radio Address
June 17, 2006

    Good morning. Earlier this week, I traveled to Baghdad to visit the 
capital of a free and democratic Iraq. It was an incredible feeling to 
stand in the cockpit of Air Force One and watch the pilot steer us in 
toward Baghdad.
    After we landed, I had the pleasure of meeting with our dedicated 
Embassy staff and intelligence officers serving far from home under 
dangerous circumstances. And I was honored to meet with some of our 
troops, including those responsible for bringing justice to the 
terrorist Zarqawi. It was a privilege to shake their hands, look them in 
the eye, and tell them how much the American people appreciate their 
daily courage and how much we appreciate the sacrifices that they and 
their families are making.
    On my trip, I also met with the new Iraqi Prime Minister 
Maliki,<Maliki, Nuri al-<ls-thn-eq> and I was able to see firsthand his 
strong character and

his determination to succeed. We held a joint meeting of our two 
Cabinets, with members of my Cabinet participating by video 
teleconference from Camp David. The Prime Minister briefed us on his 
plan to take immediate steps in three key areas: improving security; 
building up Iraq's economy so Iraqis can see real progress in their 
lives; and reaching out to the international community to secure support 
for Iraq's new Government. Then we discussed how my administration can 
help the Prime Minister accomplish these vital objectives.
    His top priority is securing Baghdad, so coalition and Iraqi forces 
have launched Operation Together Forward, a joint effort to restore 
security and the rule of law to high-risk areas of the city. To help the 
Prime Minister<Maliki, Nuri al-<ls-thn-eq> improve security, we will 
continue embedding coalition transition teams in Iraqi Army and police 
units, and we will help the new Iraqi Ministers of Defense<Mufriji, Abd 
al-Qadir al-<ls-thn-eq> and Interior<Bulani, Jawad al-<ls-thn-eq> 
improve their command and control, root out corruption, and investigate 
and punish human rights violations. We will also support the Prime 
Minister as he works to rein in illegal militias, build a judicial 
system that will provide equal justice to all, and promote 
reconciliation among the Iraqi people.
    To aid the Prime Minister<Maliki, Nuri al-<ls-thn-eq> in 
revitalizing Iraq's economy, we will send additional experts to help the 
Iraqi Government develop an economic framework that will promote job 
creation and opportunity for all Iraqis. We will also help the Prime 
Minister increase oil and electricity production by working together on 
ways to protect key infrastructure from attacks and to quickly restore 
oil and electricity production when attacks do occur.
    Finally, America will help the Prime Minister<Maliki, Nuri al-
<ls-thn-eq> engage the international community in Iraq's success. We 
will encourage other nations to fulfill the monetary pledges they have 
already made to help the new Iraqi Government succeed. We will also 
support the Prime Minister's efforts to forge a new international 
compact. Under this compact, Iraq will take a series of steps in the 
political, economic, and security areas, and in return, the 
international community will provide Iraq with more robust political and 
economic support.
    During my trip, I was impressed with the Prime Minister,<Maliki, 
Nuri al-<ls-thn-eq> the team he has assembled, and the plan he has set 
for his Government. I appreciate his determination and the determination 
of his Cabinet to make his agenda work. I told them that the future of 
Iraq is in their hands. And I told them that America is a nation that 
keeps its word, and America will stand with them as we work toward our 
shared goal: a free Iraq that can govern itself, sustain itself, and 
defend itself. By seizing this moment of opportunity, we will defeat our 
common enemies and build a lasting democracy in the heart of the Middle 
East, and that will make Americans, Iraqis, and the world more secure.
    I traveled to Baghdad to personally show our Nation's commitment to 
a free Iraq, because it is vital for the Iraqi people to know with 
certainty that America will not abandon them after we have come this 
far. The challenges that remain in Iraq are serious. We face determined 
enemies who remain intent on killing the innocent, and defeating these 
enemies will require more sacrifice and the continued patience of our 
country. But our efforts in Iraq are well worth it. The mission is 
necessary for the security of our country, and we will succeed.
    Thank you for listening.
