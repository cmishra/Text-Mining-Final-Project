Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Colombia
August 8, 2002

    On behalf of the people of the United States, I offer sympathy and 
condolences to the families of those murdered and to those injured by 
the terrorists in Colombia. I condemn these heinous acts. The terrorists 
in Colombia have made their goals clear: to kill the aspirations of the 
Colombian people for a free, prosperous, and democratic state. Through 
violence against innocents, the terrorists seek the destruction of the 
democratically elected Government of Colombia. The United States stands 
with the people of Colombia in their struggle against terror, and we 
support President Uribe's<Uribe, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> efforts to bring the 
murderers to justice.
