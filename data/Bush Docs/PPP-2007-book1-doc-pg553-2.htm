Remarks Following a Tour of Tornado Damage in Greensburg, Kansas
May 9, 2007

    I bring the prayers and concerns of the people of this country to 
this town of Greensburg, Kansas. A lot of us have seen the pictures 
about what happened here, and the pictures don't do it justice. There is 
a lot of destruction. Fortunately, a lot of folks have basements here in 
this part of the world and lived to see another day. Unfortunately, too 
many died, and we offer our prayers and condolences to those who died.
    I am struck by the strength of the character of the people who live 
here in the Plains--people who refuse to be--who refuse to have their 
spirit affected by this storm, as a matter of fact, who are willing to 
do what it takes to rebuild in a better way. America is blessed to have 
such people. And the people here will be--will find they're blessed to 
have neighbors who care, a total stranger who will come and help them.
    Our role as government officials is to work with the State and local 
folks to get whatever help is appropriate here, whatever help is in the 
law to be here as quickly as possible. My mission is to--today, though, 
is to lift people's spirits as best

as I possibly can; is to, hopefully, touch somebody's soul by 
representing our country and to let people know that while there was a 
dark day in the past, there's brighter days ahead.
    And so I want to thank the Governor<Sebelius, Kathleen<ls-thn-eq> 
and I want to thank the Senators for being here. Most importantly, I 
want to thank the people of Greensburg and their neighbors for helping 
them out. God bless the people here. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:05 p.m. on Bay Street. In his remarks, 
he referred to Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas.
