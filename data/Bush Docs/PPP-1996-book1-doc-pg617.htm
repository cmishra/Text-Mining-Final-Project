Russia-U.S. Joint Statement on the Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement: 
Transparency Measures
April 21, 1996

    The United States and Russia have agreed on transparency measures 
that provide assurances that the sides are fulfilling the obligations 
undertaken under the HEU Agreement to transform ``megatons into 
megawatts.''
    The transparency measures that have been developed are the 
culmination of two years of negotiations between official U.S. and 
Russian delegations and are evidence that irreversible nuclear 
disarmament is achievable if we work together. By blending-down HEU 
derived from nuclear weapons to low-enriched uranium that can only be 
used as fuel in commercial nuclear power reactors, we ensure that this 
material can never again be used in nuclear weapons.
