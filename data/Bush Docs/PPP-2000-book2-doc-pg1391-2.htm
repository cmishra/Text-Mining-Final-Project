Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Generalized System of Preferences
July 6, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    I hereby transmit a Proclamation in which I have determined that it 
is appropriate to suspend preferential treatment for Belarus as a 
beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) because Belarus has not taken and is not taking steps 
to afford workers in Belarus internationally recognized worker rights. 
The Proclamation also determines that Malta, French Polynesia, New 
Caledonia, and Slovenia meet the definition of a ``high income'' country 
as defined by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
and that therefore they will be graduated from the GSP, effective 
January 1, 2002.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
The proclamation of July 6 amending the Generalized System of 
Preferences is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
