Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Amendments
September 3, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for FY 2003 
budget amendments for the Departments of Health and Human Services and 
Transportation, and for International Assistance Programs.
    These amendments continue my commitment to provide necessary 
resources to enhance transportation security, to assist Israel and the 
people of the West Bank and Gaza, and to fight the growing pandemic of 
HIV/AIDS among developing countries.
    The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I 
concur with her comments and observations.
        Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
September 4. An original was not available for verification of the 
content of this letter.
