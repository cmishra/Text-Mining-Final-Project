Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
April 22, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration 
on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering 
the period February 1, 2003, through March 31, 2003. The previous 
submission covered events from December 1, 2002, through January 31, 
2003.
    As in the past, U.S. officials including Secretary of State Colin 
Powell,<Powell, Colin L.> Under Secretary of State Marc 
Grossman,<Grossman, Marc> Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. 
Weston,<Weston, Thomas G.> and Ambassador to Cyprus Michael 
Klosson<Klosson, Michael> joined me in providing intensive 
diplomatic support to the efforts of United Nations Secretary General 
Kofi Annan<Annan, Kofi> to foster a settlement to the 
longstanding division of the island. We hoped that the Secretary 
General's meetings with the two Cypriot<Papadopoulos, Tassos> 
leaders<Denktash, Rauf> in The Hague on March 10-11, 2003, 
would lead to a breakthrough on the basis of the Secretary General's 
fair and balanced settlement plan. Unfortunately, that meeting did not 
result in an agreement. Despite this setback, the United States remains 
committed to finding a just and lasting settlement for Cyprus.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard G. Lugar, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations.
