Statement on the National Medal of the Arts and National Humanities 
Medal Recipients
September 21, 1999

    This year's recipients of the 1999 National Medal of the Arts and 
National Humanities Medal stand at the pinnacle of American artistic and 
academic achievement. Through their ideas, their scholarship, and their 
works of art, they have opened all our eyes to the richness and the 
miracle of the human experience. All Americans owe them a tremendous 
debt of gratitude.
