To the Congress of the United States:

national emergency by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade

immediate threat of further attacks on the United States. A copy of my 
proclamation is attached.
    Further, I have authorized, pursuant to section 12302 of title 10, 
United States Code, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of 
Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating 
as a service within the Department of the Navy, to order to active duty 
units and individual members not assigned to units of the Ready Reserve 
to perform such missions the Secretary of Defense may determine 
necessary. The deployment of United

of my Executive Order implementing this action is attached.
