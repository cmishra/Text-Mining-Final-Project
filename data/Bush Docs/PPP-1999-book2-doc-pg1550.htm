Statement on Robert E. <Rubin, Robert E.>Rubin's Decision To 
Accept the Position as Local Initiatives Support Corporation Chairman of 
the Board
September 16, 1999

    I am pleased that Bob Rubin has accepted the job as chairman of the 
board of LISC. This service is consistent with his longstanding 
commitment to bring economic opportunities to America's most underserved 
communities. His selection is not only a tremendous boost for LISC but 
also for those who advocate community economic development to ensure 
that all Americans share in our economic prosperity.
