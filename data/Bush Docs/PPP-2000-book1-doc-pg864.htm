Message to the Congress Transmitting the District of Columbia Courts 
Budget Request
May 8, 2000

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the District of Columbia Code, as amended, I am 
transmitting the FY 2001 Budget Request of the District of Columbia 
Courts.
    The District of Columbia Courts have submitted a FY 2001 budget 
request for $104.5 million for operating expenses, $18.3 million for 
capital improvements to courthouse facilities, and $41.8 for Defender 
Services in the District of Columbia Courts. My FY 2001 budget includes 
recommended funding levels of $98.0 million for operations, $5.0 million 
for capital improvements, and $38.4 million for Defender Services. My 
transmittal of the District of Columbia Courts' budget request does not 
represent an endorsement of its contents.
    This transmittal also includes information on grants and 
reimbursements forwarded by the Courts in response to the request in 
Conference Report H. Rept. 106-479.
    I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the FY 2001 
appropriation process.

                                                      William J. Clinton

 The White House,

 May 8, 2000.
