Statement on Senate Action on Legislation on Sanctions Against India and 
Pakistan
July 9, 1998

    I am pleased that the Senate has passed legislation today that is 
consistent with my view that U.S. food exports should not become an 
unintended victim of an important nonproliferation law. Food should not 
be used as a weapon, and I will resist any action that would lead to a 
de facto grain embargo.
    I look forward to working with Congress to make sure this 
legislation or separate legislation gives us the broadest possible 
flexibility to further our nonproliferation policy without putting 
American businesses and farmers at an unfair disadvantage.
