Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the District of Columbia's 
Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Request
September 2, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Pursuant to my constitutional authority and as contemplated by 
section 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental 
Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of 
Columbia's 2009 Budget Request Act. This transmittal does not represent 
an endorsement of the contents of the D.C. government's requests.
    The proposed 2009 Budget Request Act reflects the major programmatic 
objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. For 
2009, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of $10.1 
billion.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate.
