Remarks at a Military Reenlistment Ceremony
May 23, 2001

    I don't know if the Commander in Chief is allowed to say this, but 
I'm going to anyway: At ease. [Laughter]
    Mr. Secretary,<Rumsfeld, Donald H.<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much 
for your service to the country. It's fitting that he is here today, 
because a few months ago, Secretary Rumsfeld re-upped himself. 
[Laughter] And the Nation is better off for it. General 
Shelton,<Shelton, Henry H.<ls-thn-eq> thank you for being here. Joint 
Chiefs, thank you all for coming; family and friends.
    Before I begin my remarks, I want to take note of a major event that 
took place today in the United States Senate. Just a little over an hour 
ago, the United States Senate, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, 
voted to give the tax relief to the American people. The House of 
Representatives has already voted in favor of tax relief. So I'm pleased 
to report today that tax relief is on the way.
    I want to congratulate the 62 Senators who voted for this important 
measure. Senator Lott<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> and Senator 
Grassley,<Grassley, Charles E.<ls-thn-eq> Senator Baucus,<Baucus, 
Max<ls-thn-eq> Senator Miller,<Miller, Zell<ls-thn-eq> and Senator 
Breaux<Breaux, John B.<ls-thn-eq> led the way in giving this victory to 
the American people. And they deserve our country's thanks and praise.
    The economy needs a shot in the arm, so I call on the House and the 
Senate to reach an agreement on the final tax relief package this week. 
The sooner the Congress completes its work, the sooner the American 
people will have their own money in their own pockets to save and invest 
as they see fit. Our economy cannot afford any further delays.
    And now to the task at hand. I am so appreciative that General 
Shelton<Shelton, Henry H.<ls-thn-eq> and the other leaders of the 
military are here. The men and women now know how proud you are of their 
decision to take another tour of duty. And I'm proud, too. And I welcome 
you all to the White House.
    For two centuries this house has been the final point of decision in 
the chain of command. Here President Wilson decided that American 
soldiers would have to go to Europe to fight in World War I. Here 
Franklin Roosevelt first learned of the attack at Pearl Harbor, and 
within days, America began a 4-year war in two theaters. Here four 
modern Presidents dealt with the struggle in Vietnam, from beginning to 
end.
    Every major military operation of the last 200 years was set in 
motion at the White House. The circumstances have varied greatly, but no 
President has ever had reason to doubt the ability and commitment of the 
American Armed Forces. You have shown that commitment today. Like many 
thousands of others who will reenlist this year, you've done yourselves 
credit, and you've paid your country a high tribute. The choice was 
yours to make, and you volunteered again, and your country is very 
grateful.
    Our military depends on reenlistment. This is especially true now, 
as military technology and equipment grow more complex and more 
demanding. Perhaps more than ever, the success of our all-volunteer 
force requires that we keep the best people, the most experienced 
technicians, and mature leaders of the highest caliber. That is what 
America gains with each one of you who stays.
    In return, America owes you every ounce of support you need to carry 
out your daily mission. When reenlistment declines, that's usually a 
sign that such support is missing. I have promised never to let that 
support waver, never to take you for granted. As long as I live under 
this roof, our country and our military will be prepared to meet any 
challenge the future may bring.
    For many of you, the decision to reenlist wasn't made alone. You all 
know the saying:

Soldiers enlist, but families reenlist. [Laughter] And we have many 
family members here. You're not taking an oath, but you're making an 
important commitment. And along the way, all of you have made your share 
of sacrifices. And I appreciate the chance to thank you for it. When I 
speak of supporting the military, that means family members as well, the 
bases you call home, and the schools where you send your children.
    For those who are about to take the oath, congratulations. You 
repeat some familiar words. You will do so with self-assurance that you 
might not have had the first time, that comes with hard work and 
discipline and service to our country. I want each of you to return to 
your posts with the knowledge that you have my gratitude and full 
confidence. Thank you again.
    And now it is my honor to turn over the proceedings to General 
Shelton,<Shelton, Henry H.<ls-thn-eq> who will administer the oath of 
office.

Note: The President spoke at 4:30 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House.
