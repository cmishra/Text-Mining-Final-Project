Statement on the Supreme Court Decision Not To Review New Jersey's 
``Megan's Law''
February 21, 1998

    This morning the Supreme Court declined to review a challenge to the 
community notification provision of New Jersey's ``Megan's Law,'' thus 
leaving intact a crucial tool to protect children from known sexual 
predators. Because of the importance of this law to families and 
communities, my administration has defended its constitutionality, 
enacted a similar Federal Megan's Law, and worked with States to 
establish a national sex offender registry. We will continue to do 
everything we can to make sure that community notification and sex 
offender registration laws are enforced and upheld throughout the 
country.
