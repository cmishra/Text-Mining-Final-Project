Statement on Russian Ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention
November 5, 1997

    I warmly welcome the action by the Russian Government today in 
ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). This landmark 
agreement, which the United States ratified last April, is already 
proving its value in enhancing international security. To date, 104 
countries have ratified the CWC, which outlaws the development, 
production, possession, and use of chemical weapons. Russia's 
ratification makes it possible for Russia to join the United States in 
playing a leadership role in ensuring that all of the Convention's 
benefits are realized. I congratulate President Yeltsin, the Russian 
Duma, and the Federation Council on successfully completing CWC 
ratification. Russia's action today is an important step forward in 
achieving our mutual arms control objectives. I look forward to further 
progress in the months to come.
