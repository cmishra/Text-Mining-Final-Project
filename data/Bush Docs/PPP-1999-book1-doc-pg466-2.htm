Statement on the Death of Joe Williams<Williams, Joe>
March 30, 1999

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of jazz and 
blues great Joe Williams. He was a national treasure. For the better 
part of this century, America was blessed with Joe Williams' smooth 
baritone voice and peerless interpretations of our favorite ballads. 
Hearing Joe Williams sing at the White House in 1993 remains one of my 
favorite memories. Hillary and I are grateful for the opportunity to 
have welcomed him back for the Kennedy Center Honors every year since. 
We send our prayers and deepest sympathies to his family and friends.
