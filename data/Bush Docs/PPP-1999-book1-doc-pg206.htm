Statement on Senator Richard H. Bryan's<Bryan, Richard H.> 
Decision Not To Seek Reelection
February 18, 1999

    Throughout his career, Senator Richard Bryan has been a staunch 
advocate and tireless champion of the people of Nevada. He has been an 
ardent protector of Nevada's environment and has been a leader in 
preserving Nevada's lands and treasures. Senator Bryan has played a 
critical role in promoting rigorous health and safety standards for 
America's children and consumers. As a distinguished member of the 
Finance Committee, Senator Bryan has consistently been recognized for 
his leadership in promoting fiscal responsibility and has helped ensure 
a brighter future for Nevadans and all Americans. While his decision to 
retire must be somewhat bittersweet, I know that he will continue to 
fight for what he believes in and will continue to be a proponent for 
America's progress. Hillary and I send our best regards to Dick and his 
family for every future success and happiness.
