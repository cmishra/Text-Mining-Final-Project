Statement on Signing the Energy and Water Development Appropriations 
Act, 1995
August 26, 1994

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 4506, the ``Energy and Water 
Development Appropriations Act, FY 1995.''
    The Act provides a total of $20.5 billion in discretionary budget 
authority for various programs in the Departments of Energy and the 
Interior, the Army Corps of Engineers, and several smaller agencies.
    I am pleased that the Act substantially funds most of my budget 
requests for priority investment programs within the Departments of 
Energy and the Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers, including full 
funding for the renewable energy portions of the Climate Change Action 
Plan.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
August 26, 1994.

Note: H.R. 4506, approved August 26, was assigned Public Law No. 103-
316.
