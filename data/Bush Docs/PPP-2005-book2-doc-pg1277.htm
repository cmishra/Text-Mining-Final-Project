The President's Radio Address
July 23, 2005

    Good morning. Under the Constitution, one of the most consequential 
decisions a President makes is an appointment to the Supreme Court. This 
week I was proud to announce my nomination of Judge John 
Roberts<Roberts, John G., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> to be the Supreme Court's next 
Associate Justice.
    Judge Roberts<Roberts, John G., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> has a stellar record 
of achievement. He is a man of sound judgment and the highest integrity. 
He has the qualities Americans expect in a judge, experience, wisdom, 
fairness, and civility. He has profound respect for the rule of law and 
for the liberties guaranteed to every citizen. He will strictly apply 
the Constitution and laws, not legislate from the bench.
    Judge Roberts<Roberts, John G., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> currently serves on 
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 
which is often considered America's second highest court. He has also 
served as a top lawyer at the Department of Justice, an attorney in the 
White House for President Ronald Reagan, and a distinguished advocate in 
private practice. He gained early experience at the Supreme Court as a 
law clerk to Justice William Rehnquist.<Rehnquist, William H.<ls-thn-eq> 
He graduated with high honors from both Harvard College and Harvard Law 
School. And as a young man growing up in Indiana, he captained his high 
school football team and worked summers in a steel mill to earn money 
for college.
     One of the highest honors for any lawyer is to argue a case before 
the Supreme Court. In his extraordinary career, Judge Roberts<Roberts, 
John G., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> has argued a remarkable 39 cases before the 
Nation's highest court. He is known by Democrats and Republicans alike 
as a brilliant thinker, a fair-minded judge, and a decent man. After I 
nominated Judge Roberts to the Court of Appeals in 2001, a bipartisan 
group of more than 150 lawyers sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, and here is what they wrote: ``Although as individuals we 
reflect a wide spectrum of political party affiliation and ideology, we 
are united in our belief that John Roberts will be an outstanding 
Federal appeals court judge and should be confirmed by the United States 
Senate. He is one of the very best and most highly respected appellate 
lawyers in the Nation.''
    The next step for Judge Roberts<Roberts, John G., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> is 
the Senate confirmation process. The process is off to a good start. 
Since I announced his nomination, Judge Roberts has met with a number of 
Senators from both parties. Democrats and Republicans have expressed 
their respect for Judge Roberts's qualifications and intellect, just as 
they did 2 years ago when they confirmed him to be a Federal appeals 
court judge by unanimous consent.
    In the weeks ahead, the Senate will have an opportunity to rise 
above partisanship. I've spoken to Senate Majority Leader Frist<Frist, 
Bill<ls-thn-eq> and Minority Leader Reid<Reid, Harry<ls-thn-eq> as well 
as chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senators 
Specter<Specter, Arlen<ls-thn-eq> and Leahy.<Leahy, Patrick 
J.<ls-thn-eq>

These Senators share my goal of an orderly and dignified confirmation 
process, and it is important that Judge Roberts<Roberts, John G., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> be confirmed before the Court reconvenes on October the 
3d.
    President Clinton's<Clinton, William J.<ls-thn-eq> two appointments 
to the Supreme Court proved that the Senate can conduct a thorough 
review and vote on a nominee within a reasonable timetable. Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg<Ginsburg, Ruth Bader<ls-thn-eq> was confirmed 42 days 
after the President submitted her nomination, and Justice Stephen 
Breyer<Breyer, Stephen G.<ls-thn-eq> was confirmed 73 days after his 
nomination was submitted. In both cases, Democrats and Republicans 
helped move the process forward promptly and voted to confirm the 
justices, despite significant philosophical differences.
    America is fortunate to have a man of such wisdom and intellectual 
strength willing to serve our country. I'm grateful to Judge 
Roberts'<Roberts, John G., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> wife, Jane,<Roberts, 
Jane<ls-thn-eq> and their two children, Jack<Roberts, John 
``Jack''<ls-thn-eq> and Josie,<Roberts, Josephine<ls-thn-eq> and I look 
forward to the Senate voting to confirm Judge John Roberts as 109th 
justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
    Thank you for listening.

Room at the White House for broadcast at 10:06 a.m. on July 23. The 
transcript was made available by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
July 22 but was embargoed for release until the broadcast. The Office of
