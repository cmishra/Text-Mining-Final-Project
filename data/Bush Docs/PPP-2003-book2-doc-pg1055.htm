    John Rhodes was a statesman and a leader in the United States 
Congress. He was admired by Republicans and Democrats alike for his 30 
years of tireless work for the people he represented and the country he 
loved. Laura joins me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his wife, 
Elizabeth,<Rhodes, Elizabeth<ls-thn-eq> and the entire Rhodes family.
