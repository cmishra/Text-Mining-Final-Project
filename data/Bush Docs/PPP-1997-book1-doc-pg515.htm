Statement on Senate Confirmation of Alexis Herman as Secretary of Labor
April 30, 1997

    I want to thank the Senate for its strong show of support for Alexis 
Herman. There was never any question that she was highly qualified to be 
Secretary of Labor. She understands the needs of workers and understands 
the challenges they face as we approach the 21st century.
    This is an important time for the Labor Department. The Department 
must reform and manage programs that will help prepare America's working 
men and women for the challenges of our changing economy. Alexis Herman 
is fully prepared to lead the Department in this effort. She will be an 
outstanding Secretary of Labor.
