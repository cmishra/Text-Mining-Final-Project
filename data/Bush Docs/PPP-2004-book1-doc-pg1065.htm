Statement on the Report of the Commission on Implementation of United 
States Space Exploration Policy
June 16, 2004

    I am pleased that Chairman Pete Aldridge<Aldridge, Edward C. 
``Pete''<ls-thn-eq> and the members of the Commission on Implementation 
of United States Space Exploration Policy have developed recommendations 
supporting the vision for America's space program. I appreciate their 
hard work and service.
    The Commission's report makes clear that this vision, which I 
announced in January, is a sustainable and affordable long-term human 
and robotic program to explore space. We will explore space to improve 
our lives and lift our national spirit. Space exploration is also likely 
to produce scientific discoveries in fields from biology to physics and 
to advance aerospace and a host of other industries. This will help 
create more highly skilled jobs, inspire students and teachers in math 
and science, and ensure that we continue to benefit from space 
technology, which has already brought us important improvements in areas 
as diverse as hurricane forecasting, satellite communications, and 
medical devices.
    The Commission worked diligently to collect ideas from a variety of 
voices from across the country and to develop innovative 
recommendations. The Commission's recommendations will be reviewed and 
considered, and NASA will accelerate the transformation it has begun. I 
am confident that the Commission's report will help Congress, NASA, 
other Government agencies, the private sector, the international 
community, and the American public to work together to undertake the 
next steps in our journey into space for the benefit of generations to 
come.
