Statement on Senate Passage of the ``Breast and Cervical Cancer Act of 
1999''
October 4, 2000

    I am extremely pleased that the Senate unanimously passed 
legislation today providing an important new health coverage option to 
low-income, uninsured women with breast cancer. With passage of the 
``Breast and Cervical Cancer Act of 1999,'' the Senate has virtually 
assured that the Congress will present me with legislation that I was 
pleased to include in this year's budget and that I will be proud to 
sign into law. I would like to thank my wife, Hillary,<Clinton, Hillary 
Rodham> for her constant advocacy on behalf of this 
legislation. Her longstanding advocacy for women with breast cancer is 
well known and has been the inspiration behind this administration's 
unwavering commitment to this issue. I look forward to final passage of 
this important bill and the new security it will provide for thousands 
of women with breast cancer.
