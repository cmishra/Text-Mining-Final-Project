Statement on Easing Sanctions Against North Korea
June 19, 2000

    Since last September, when I announced the measures being 
implemented today to ease sanctions against North Korea, North Korea has 
maintained its moratorium on missile tests. These measures are supported 
by our close allies in the region and are part of the process of close 
coordination between the United States, Japan, and South Korea 
recommended by former Secretary of Defense William Perry.<Perry, William 
J.<ls-thn-eq> We will continue to build on these efforts and on the 
recent North-South summit to achieve additional progress in addressing 
our common proliferation concerns.
