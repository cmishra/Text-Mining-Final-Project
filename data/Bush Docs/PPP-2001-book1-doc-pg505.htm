Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Budget
May 9, 2001

    Today's bipartisan budget vote in the House is a victory for 
fairness and the American people. I commend Republicans and Democrats 
for joining together to pass a budget framework that will return money 
to the taxpayers and provide reasonable spending increases. The economy 
continues to show troubling signs, and we must take decisive steps, like 
this vote today, to ensure sound fiscal policy. The American people can 
take heart that tax relief is one important step closer to reality.
