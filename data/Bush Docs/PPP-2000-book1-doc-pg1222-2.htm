Statement on the Shootings of Government Meat Inspectors
June 22, 2000

    I was shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic shootings 
of<Hillery, Jeannie<ls-thn-eq> three<Quadros, Tom<ls-thn-eq> 
government<Shaline, Bill<ls-thn-eq> inspectors, including two U.S. 
Department of Agriculture employees, in California. The Federal 
Government is working closely with local authorities on this matter. 
This grievous act was committed against dedicated individuals who were 
working to ensure the public's health and safety. I want to join all 
Americans in extending our thoughts and prayers to the victims and their 
families and coworkers.
