Statement on the Resignation of Alice Rivlin<Rivlin, Alice> as 
Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
June 3, 1999

    I am sorry to hear that Alice Rivlin is stepping down as Vice Chair 
of the Federal Reserve. During my administration, she has served with 
distinction and integrity both as Vice Chair of

the Federal Reserve and as Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget. For many years, Alice has been a steady and strong voice for 
fiscal discipline, and she deserves much credit for helping usher in a 
new era of budget surpluses.
    Alice has a deep and abiding commitment to the city of Washington, 
DC. Her work and advice have played a critical role in helping turn 
around the finances of our Capital City and putting the District in a 
better position to reshape its future. I am glad that she will continue 
her work as Chair of the DC Financial Assistance Authority. I thank 
Alice for her dedication and hard work and wish her well in the future.
