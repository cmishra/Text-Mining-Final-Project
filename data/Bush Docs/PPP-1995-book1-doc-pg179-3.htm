Statement on the Apprehension of Ramzi Ahmed Yusuf
February 8, 1995

    This evening in New York, Ramzi Ahmed Yusuf, one of the world's most 
sought after suspected terrorists, was placed in Federal detention. 
Yusuf is under indictment as a key figure in the 1993 bombing of the New 
York World Trade Center. He was on the FBI's Most Wanted List.
    Yusuf was recently arrested by Pakistan and turned over to U.S. 
authorities in accordance with the requirements of international law.
    I especially want to thank all involved in this important process. 
This arrest is a major step forward in the fight against terrorism. 
Terrorism will not pay. Terrorists will pay. We will continue to work 
with other nations to thwart those who would kill innocent citizens to 
further their own political aims.
    The Executive order I signed last month to stop fundraising for 
Middle East terrorist groups and my proposed omnibus antiterrorism act 
will greatly strengthen our abilities to act quickly and decisively 
against this threat to peace. The budget I submitted earlier this week 
maintains the vigorous law enforcement, intelligence, and diplomatic 
capabilities the United States requires to act effectively against 
terrorism on all fronts.
    We and other members of the international community will continue to 
dedicate ourselves to the cause of peace and to unite against those who 
threaten innocent lives.
