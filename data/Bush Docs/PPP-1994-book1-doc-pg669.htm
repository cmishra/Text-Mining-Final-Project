Statement on Trade Sanctions Against Taiwan
April 11, 1994

    This is the first time any country has acted on the international 
call for trade sanctions to protect endangered species, but if the 
illegal trade in rhinos and tigers is not eliminated, these species 
could be extinct in 5 years. This administration recognizes that threats 
to endangered species are of critical importance. The world must know 
that the United States will take strong actions to protect the Earth's 
natural heritage.

Note: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary 
on the institution of trade sanctions against Taiwan.
