Statement on the Terrorist Bombings in Mumbai, India
August 25, 2003

    I strongly condemn the bombings in Mumbai, India, which killed 
dozens of innocent people and injured many more. Acts of terror are 
intended to sow fear and chaos among free peoples. I hope that the 
perpetrators of these murders will be identified quickly and brought to 
justice.
    On behalf of all Americans, I send condolences to all affected by 
today's tragedy and to the Government and people of India.
