Message on the Observance of Ramadan
October 24, 2003

    I send greetings to Muslims in the United States and around the 
world observing the holy month of Ramadan.
    Ramadan is the holiest season in the Islamic faith, commemorating 
the revelation of the Qur'an to Muhammed. This month of introspection 
provides Muslims a time to focus on their faith and practice God's 
commands. Through fasting, prayer, contemplation, and charity, Muslims 
around the world renew their commitment to lead lives of honesty, 
integrity, and compassion.

    Throughout our history, people of different faiths have shaped the 
character of our Nation. Islam is a peaceful religion, and people who 
practice the Islamic faith have made great contributions to our Nation 
and the world. As Americans, we cherish our freedom to worship and we 
remain committed to welcoming individuals of all religions. By working 
together to advance freedom and mutual understanding, we are creating a 
brighter future of hope and opportunity.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending our best wishes. 
Ramadan mubarak.

                                                          George W. Bush
