Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Budget Legislation
March 25, 2004

    I commend the House for passing a responsible budget that advances 
our three highest priorities: defending America, winning the war on 
terror, and promoting growth and job creation, while cutting the deficit 
in half within 5 years. I am also pleased that this moves us closer to 
making the tax relief for America's workers and families permanent.
    I urge the House and Senate to reach agreement quickly and pass a 
budget based on my principles of funding what's necessary to protect 
America and keep our economy growing, while restraining spending 
elsewhere.
