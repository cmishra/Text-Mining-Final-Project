Statement on the Death of Tito Puente<Puente, Tito<ls-thn-eq>
June 1, 2000

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of the Latin jazz 
band leader Tito Puente. For more than 50 years, Puente was more than a 
musician--he was a trailblazer. The five-time Grammy award winner's 
countless recordings are classics in the genre he helped define.
    In 1997 I was honored to welcome Tito Puente to the White House and 
present him with the National Medal of the Arts. At that ceremony, I 
said, ``Just hearing Tito Puente's name makes you want to get up and 
dance. With his finger on the pulse of the Latin American musical 
tradition and his hands on the timbales, he has probably gotten more 
people out of their seats and onto the dance floor than any other living 
artist.'' This is truly his legacy--music that brings joy to young and 
old, to people of any background and in many nations, all around the 
world. We will miss Tito Puente's vibrant presence both on stage and 
off, but we know his spirit will endure in the music he has given us.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and many friends.
