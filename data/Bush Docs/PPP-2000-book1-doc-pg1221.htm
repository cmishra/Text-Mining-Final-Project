Statement on Proposed School Modernization Legislation
June 22, 2000

    Every year that Congress stalls on passing critical school 
modernization legislation is another year our children have to go to 
class in trailers, in crowded classrooms, in crumbling schools. A new 
U.S. Department of Education survey of the condition of American schools 
gives cause for concern. Rising enrollments and years of deferred 
maintenance have taken a serious toll, jeopardizing our children's 
health and the quality of their education. According to the report, our 
schools require $127 billion in repairs and 3.5 million students attend 
school in buildings that need to be replaced altogether.
    Children cannot learn in crumbling schools. It is clear that 
additional resources are needed to accommodate record enrollments and 
allow smaller classes. I have called on Congress to enact my proposal to 
repair 25,000 schools over the next 5 years. In addition, I have 
proposed a school construction tax cut that would help communities build 
and modernize 6,000 schools. Representatives Charles Rangel<Rangel, 
Charles B.<ls-thn-eq> and Nancy Johnson<Johnson, Nancy L.<ls-thn-eq> 
have introduced legislation to do just that. While there is broad 
bipartisan support for this key school modernization legislation, 
congressional leaders have refused to even bring it to a vote. Congress 
should act now to give all our children the safe, modern, world-class 
schools they deserve.
