Statement on Terrorist Attacks in Spain
August 9, 2000

    On behalf of all Americans, I wish to express my condolences to the 
families of the recent victims of terrorist violence in Spain. We stand 
with the people of Spain who condemn these cowardly acts and hope the 
perpetrators will be brought swiftly to justice. There is no place for 
violence and terrorism in the pursuit of political goals.
