Exchange With Reporters in Dallas, Texas
March 26, 1994

Health Care Reform

    Q. Mr. President, what's the message from this part of the visit?
    The President. Did you see the people we saw outside?
    Q. Yes.
    The President. The people we saw outside either don't have coverage 
or they're afraid of losing it. These children got this care because 
this hospital is open to all children and gives all children great care, 
without regard to their income. But not all children have access to 
hospitals like this. So the message is that all families

with children should have some insurance coverage so they can get health 
care and so they can be well like this. It was great.

Roger Clinton's Wedding

    Q. How are the wedding preparations going?
    The President. Fine. We're excited.

Note: The exchange began at 8:22 a.m. at the Scottish Rite Hospital for 
Children. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
this exchange.
