Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Peacekeeping
May 8, 2001

Dear Mr. Chairman:
    I am pleased to transmit herewith the 2000 Annual Report to the 
Congress on Peacekeeping required by section 4 of the United Nations 
Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287b).
    United Nations and other peacekeeping operations conducted under the 
previous Administration helped us protect U.S. interests before they 
were directly threatened and helped ensure that other nations shared 
with us the risks and costs of maintaining international stability.
    I look forward to working with you to ensure that, under the right 
circumstances, peacekeeping remains a viable option for dealing with 
international conflicts.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations; John W. Warner, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Armed Services; Ted Stevens, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Appropriations; Henry J. Hyde, chairman, House Committee on 
International Relations; Bob Stump, chairman, House Committee on Armed 
Services; and C.W. Bill Young, chairman, House Committee on 
Appropriations.
