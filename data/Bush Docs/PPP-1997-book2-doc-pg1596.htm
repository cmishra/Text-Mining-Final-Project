Statement on Representative Ronald V. Dellums' Decision Not To Seek 
Reelection
November 17, 1997

    Representative Ron Dellums has been an indefatigable advocate in the 
Congress for the interests of ordinary Americans, in Oakland and 
throughout the Nation. He has worked hard to secure policies and 
programs that respond to the needs of poor and middle income families. I 
have appreciated his strong voice and his effective work for justice and 
reconciliation, not only here but around the world. He has been a highly 
forceful leader for our national security, making sure that the vital 
work of national defense is conducted with a watchful eye on taxpayer 
dollars.
    I thank Ron for his long and effective years of commitment and 
service to America. The people of Oakland and the Nation owe him a debt 
of gratitude.
