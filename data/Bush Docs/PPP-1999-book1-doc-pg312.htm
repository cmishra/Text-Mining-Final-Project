Statement on the National Assessment of Education Progress
March 4, 1999

    Today's release of State-by-State National Assessment of Education 
Progress scores is evidence that our efforts to raise academic standards 
have begun to pay off. Many States have shown significant improvement in 
reading in the last 4 years, and some States that had scores well below 
the national average have made the greatest gains. But much remains to 
be done to ensure that every child in America is mastering the basics. 
That is why I urge the Senate to vote this week to continue funding for 
100,000 new, well-prepared teachers to reduce class size in the early 
grades. Parents and teachers across the country know that smaller 
classes lead to improved student performance in reading and other basic 
skills. We should grasp this opportunity to build on the gains we have 
made, so that every child in America is prepared to meet the challenges 
of the 21st century.
