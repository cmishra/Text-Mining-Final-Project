Statement on Signing Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Legislation
April 23, 1993

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 1335, the ``Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations'' Act of 1993. This Act provides $4 billion in emergency 
unemployment compensation to approximately 1.9 million unemployed 
American workers. This critical assistance will help the unemployed and 
their families with grocery bills, mortgage payments and other expenses 
while they seek new employment. I am disappointed that the job-producing 
elements of the original version of the legislation were forced to be 
removed from it.
    Our efforts to create jobs, increase investment, and safeguard our 
communities and our children, were frustrated by the use of 
parliamentary tactics in the Senate in the furtherance of politics-as-
usual. The losers, in the end, were jobless Americans looking for the 
dignity of employment, and communities across the United States looking 
forward to meeting unmet national needs through growth-oriented efforts 
provided by the legislation in its original form. It is my hope that the 
Congress will consider further legislation to produce the jobs that are 
needed to strengthen and sustain the current economic recovery.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
April 23, 1993.

Note: H.R. 1335, approved April 23, was assigned Public Law No. 103-24. 
This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
April 24.
