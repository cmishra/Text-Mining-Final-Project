Message Sending Holiday Greetings to Members of the Armed Forces
December 23, 2008

To the Men and Women of the United States Armed Forces
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send season's greetings to you 
and your families during the holidays.
    America is blessed to have brave citizens willing to step forward to 
defend our freedoms and keep us safe from our enemies. For many of you, 
this holiday season will be spent far from home, and our Nation honors 
your sacrifice. We remain mindful of your courage, ask God to watch over 
you, and pray for your safe return.
    Your family members serve our country as well. During this time of 
year, they are a special source of hope and strength to you, and they 
both deserve and have the thanks and support of our whole Nation. Their 
selfless dedication sets an example of patriotism for all Americans to 
follow.
    May God bless you and keep you safe, and may God bless America.

                                                          George W. Bush
