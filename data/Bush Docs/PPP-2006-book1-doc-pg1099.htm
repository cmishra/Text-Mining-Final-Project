Statement on Congressional Passage on Mine Safety Legislation
June 7, 2006

    I am pleased that the Congress has acted in a bipartisan way to pass 
important mine safety legislation. This legislation will complement the 
Mine Safety and Health Administration's efforts to enhance mine safety 
training, improve safety and communications technology, and provide 
emergency caches of breathable air for miners. The bill also increases 
penalties for those who violate mine safety laws. America's miners and 
their families can be confident that their Government is committed to 
taking measures that will help prevent accidents and save lives. I look 
forward to signing this bill into law.

Note: The statement referred to S. 2803.
