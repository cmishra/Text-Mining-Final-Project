Statement on the Crash Landing of American Airlines Flight 1420 at 
Little Rock National Airport
June 2, 1999

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the terrible crash landing 
of American Airlines Flight 1420 at Little Rock National Airport late 
last night. We join the American people in extending our deepest 
sympathies to the families of those who died or were injured.
    Our Government is doing everything possible to aid the victims and 
help determine the cause of this tragedy. Family assistance counselors 
and other personnel from the National Transportation Safety Board are 
already on the ground in Little Rock, and FAA inspectors are assisting 
the NTSB. I have asked my staff to update me on our efforts throughout 
the day. I ask all Americans to remember in their prayers the passengers 
and their families.
