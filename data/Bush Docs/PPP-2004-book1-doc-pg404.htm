Message on the Observance of Saint Patrick's Day, 2004
March 16, 2004

    I send greetings to those celebrating St. Patrick's Day.
    On March 17th, we honor the remarkable life of Patrick, patron saint 
of Ireland. He helped bring Christianity to the Irish people. His 
generosity and love of liberty shaped Ireland's history and culture, and 
through generations of immigrants, those values have helped shape 
America.
    We are grateful for the many ways Irish-Americans have blessed our 
country. They have helped to expand our economy, create our communities, 
and defend our homeland. Through their public service, they have 
strengthened our democracy, and their dedication to faith and family has 
enriched our Nation's character.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a happy St. Patrick's Day.

                                                          George W. Bush
