Statement on the Death of Jamie Whitten
September 9, 1995

    It is with deep regret that I learned today of the death of former 
Congressman and Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee Jamie 
Whitten. Congressman Whitten served Mississippi and our country in 
Congress for 53 years, longer than any other person in the history of 
this Republic. He was literally an institution himself within one of the 
most important of our democratic institutions.
    Throughout his long service and especially as chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee from the 96th Congress through the 100th 
Congress, Congressman Whitten dedicated himself to the concerns of the 
hard-working people of this country. He worked tirelessly on behalf of 
America's farmers, especially our family farmers, and he never gave up 
working to build more opportunity for all Americans willing to make the 
most of their own lives.
    The people of the United States and of Mississippi will miss Jamie 
Whitten. Hillary and I send our sympathies to his family and loved ones.
