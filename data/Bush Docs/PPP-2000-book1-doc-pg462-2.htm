Statement on Signing the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000
March 14, 2000

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 1883, the ``Iran Nonproliferation 
Act of 2000.''
    I fully share the Congress's objective of promoting nonproliferation 
and combating Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD) and missile delivery systems. This issue remains at the top of the 
agenda with Russia as well as with other countries whose companies may 
be providing such assistance to Iran. In the case of Russian entities' 
cooperation with Iran, we have imposed penalties ten times in the past 
and stand ready to apply them again whenever necessary.
    The expansive reporting requirements in this bill in many ways 
duplicate existing laws, and my Administration will work with the 
Congress to rationalize these overlapping reporting requirements. We 
will also seek to rationalize the reporting requirements relating to 
certain transfers in instances where those transfers are legal under the 
applicable foreign laws and consistent with the guidelines of the 
applicable multilateral export control regime.
    This bill, as amended, is less problematic than the earlier version 
that passed the House and will not harm our efforts to halt 
international cooperation with Iran's WMD and missile programs. 
Therefore, I have signed H.R. 1883.
    I want to make it clear that Russia continues to be a valued partner 
in the International Space Station (ISS). H.R. 1833 requires certain 
determinations for purchases from Russia related to the ISS, but does 
not affect Russia's important role as an ISS partner. My Administration 
will also continue to work closely with the General Director of the 
Russian Aviation and Space Agency in his role as Special Representative 
on nonproliferation.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

March 14, 2000.

Note: H.R. 1883, approved March 14, was assigned Public Law No. 106-178.
