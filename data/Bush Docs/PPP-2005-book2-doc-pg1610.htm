Remarks at the White House Conference on Helping America's Youth
October 27, 2005

    Thank you all. Thanks for the warm welcome to Laura.<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> Please be seated. Thank you. I am the introducer--
[laughter]--a rare role for me these days but one I've been looking 
forward to.
    First of all, thank you all for coming. I want to thank Howard 
University for hosting this important summit. I love to be with the 
armies of compassion. At my State of the Union last year, I asked 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> to lead an initiative to help young people 
grow up to be successful adults. And since that State of the Union, she 
has taken me up on my request, and she has traveled the country to 
observe and find best practices and programs that are changing people's 
lives for the better.

    And so she<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> called this summit to serve as a 
catalyst to continue to rally decent, honorable people who are working 
hard to make sure young Americans have a chance to realize the promise 
of this country. She is a great leader of this cause, a wonderful

wife, and a wonderful First Lady for our country.
    Laura Bush.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq>

Note: The President spoke at 9:35 a.m. at Howard University. The 
transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included 
the remarks of the First Lady.
