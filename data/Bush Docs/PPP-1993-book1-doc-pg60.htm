Statement on the Withdrawal of Kimba Wood as a Candidate for Attorney 
General
February 5, 1993

    I understand and respect Judge Wood's decision not to proceed 
further with the possibility of being nominated as Attorney General. I 
was greatly impressed with her as a lawyer, a judge, and a person. I 
respect her legal talents, judicial record, and integrity. I wish her 
well.
