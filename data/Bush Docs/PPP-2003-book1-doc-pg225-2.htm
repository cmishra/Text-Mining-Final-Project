Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Cuba
February 27, 2003

To the Congress of the United States:
     Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to the 
Government of Cuba's destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian 
aircraft in international airspace north of Cuba on February 24, 1996, 
is to continue in effect beyond March 1, 2003, to the Federal Register 
for publication.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 February 27, 2003.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
