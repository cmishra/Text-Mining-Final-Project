Statement on the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Conflict
February 9, 1999

    I am deeply concerned by the heavy fighting along the border between 
Ethiopia and Eritrea. Since the dispute began in May 1998, my 
administration has sought to work with these two friends of the United 
States to achieve a peaceful resolution. Susan Rice,<Rice, Susan 
E.> the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, has 
conducted intensive shuttle diplomacy between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and 
former National Security Adviser Anthony Lake<Lake, Anthony> 
has made four trips to the region at my request.
    We remain committed to this crucial effort. A peaceful solution can 
and must be found without delay. I urge both parties to halt the 
fighting immediately. If the conflict continues, its human and economic 
cost will be incalculable for the people of Ethiopia and Eritrea and for 
the entire region.
    I am disappointed that hostilities resumed while sustained 
diplomatic efforts by the international community were continuing. We 
welcome Ethiopia's standing acceptance of the Organization of African 
Unity's Framework Agreement and maintain our support for the efforts of 
the OAU and others to promote a peaceful resolution of this conflict.
    The return to hostilities cannot bring about a lasting solution to 
this dispute. I am particularly alarmed by the recent use of air power, 
which escalates the conflict and violates the agreed airstrike 
moratorium. I urge the Ethiopian Government to refrain from further use

of its aircraft as currently employed along the border, and I ask both 
sides to renew their commitment to the moratorium.
    For the sake of their people, the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea 
must immediately halt the fighting and recommit themselves to diplomatic 
efforts to secure a peaceful settlement.
