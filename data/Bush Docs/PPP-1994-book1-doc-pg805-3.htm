    The President today announced the appointment of Jack H. Watson, 
Jr., and Ambassador Edward J. Perkins to represent the United States in 
Australia during the celebration of Coral Sea Week.
    ``I am pleased to appoint Jack Watson to join Ambassador Perkins as 
the U.S. representatives on this momentous occasion,'' the President 
said. ``I have known Jack for many years. As President Carter's former 
Chief of Staff, he understands particularly well the important 
relationship between the United States and Australia, and I am confident 
he will represent the United States well. We join them in celebrating 
our friendship with Australia and look forward to continuing our 
excellent relations across a range of economic, political, and global 
issues.''
