Statement on the Situation in Timor-Leste
February 11, 2008

    I strongly condemn the violent attacks against Jose Ramos-
Horta,<Ramos-Horta, Jose<ls-thn-eq> President of Timor-Leste, and Kay 
Rala Xanana Gusmao,<Gusmao, Kay Rala Xanana<ls-thn-eq> Prime Minister of 
Timor-Leste. Laura and I offer our condolences to the families of those 
killed in the attacks, and we send our prayers for a rapid recovery to 
President Ramos-Horta and the others injured.
    Those who are responsible must know that they cannot derail 
democracy in Timor-Leste, and they will be held accountable for their 
actions. The United States remains committed to working with the people 
of Timor-Leste to strengthen democracy there. I also offer my full 
support to the Government of Timor-Leste, the United Nations Integrated 
Mission in Timor-Leste, and the International Stabilization Force as 
they work to maintain calm and security.
