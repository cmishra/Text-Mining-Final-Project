Message to the Senate Transmitting Protocol Amending the Sweden-United 
States Taxation Convention
November 10, 2005

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, a Protocol Amending the Convention Between the Government 
of the United States of America and the Government of Sweden for the 
Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with 
Respect to Taxes on Income signed at Washington on September 30, 2005 
(the ``Protocol''). Also transmitted for the information of the Senate 
is the report of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.
    The Protocol eliminates the withholding tax on certain cross-border 
dividend payments. The proposed Protocol is one of a few recent U.S. tax 
agreements to provide for the elimination of the withholding tax on 
dividends arising from certain direct investments. In addition, the 
Protocol also modernizes the Convention to bring it into closer 
conformity with current U.S. tax-treaty policy, including strengthening 
the treaty's provisions preventing so-called treaty shopping.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Protocol and that the Senate give its advice and consent to 
ratification.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 November 10, 2005.
