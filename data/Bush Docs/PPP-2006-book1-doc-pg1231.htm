Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Requesting 
Additional Funds for the Department of Veterans Affairs
June 28, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed fully 
offset FY 2006 request for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to 
address the security of personal information of veterans and service 
personnel.
    I am requesting these additional resources for VA to cover the 
increased costs to the VA information technology account in FY 2006 as a 
result of providing credit monitoring and fraud watch services for 
veterans and service members impacted by a security breach that occurred 
on May 3, 2006. The total cost of this effort, estimated to be $160.5 
million in FY 2006, is fully offset.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
