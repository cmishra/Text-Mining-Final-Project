Statement on the Selection of Zell <Miller, Zell>Miller To Be 
Senator From Georgia
July 24, 2000

    Georgia Governor Roy Barnes<Barnes, Roy> has exercised 
great wisdom in selecting former Governor Zell Miller to fill the Senate 
seat of the late Paul Coverdell. Zell Miller will continue to 
demonstrate the same devotion to the citizens of Georgia and our Nation 
that was the hallmark of Senator Coverdell's Senate career. Having 
established himself as one of the greatest Governors in Georgia history, 
Zell returned to his first love, teaching college. He now comes to 
Washington out of a profound sense of duty to his Nation and the people 
of his State.
    His commitment and accomplishments in education have rightly earned 
him the title, ``the education Governor.'' I was so impressed with the 
HOPE scholarships he began in Georgia that I took the program national, 
giving millions of young people the opportunity to pursue their dream of 
a college education. Zell Miller has also been a leader in the areas of 
economic development, crime prevention, and social justice. In every job 
he has ever held--as a U.S. marine, college professor, Lieutenant 
Governor, and Governor--Zell Miller has put the interest of hard working 
families first. I believe he will

be a great United States Senator, and I look forward to working with 
him.
