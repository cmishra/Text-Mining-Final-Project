Remarks During a Visit With Chancellor Angela Merkel<Merkel, 
Angela<ls-thn-eq> of Germany in Crawford, Texas
November 9, 2007

    President Bush. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are thrilled to 
welcome the Chancellor and Professor Sauer<Sauer, Joachim<ls-thn-eq> 
here to our place. In Texas, when you invite somebody to your home, it's 
an expression of warmth and respect, and that's how I feel about 
Chancellor Merkel. And so, Madam Chancellor, welcome. We're looking 
forward to having constructive talks as well as a chance to relax and 
visit.
    Chancellor Merkel. Well, I would like to say a very warm thanks to 
you, George, for issuing this invitation to us. Already a first glance 
of the area shows us that this is, indeed, a wonderful place to be and a 
wonderful atmosphere. We have a number of issues that I think we will 
have now time to discuss later on. I'm very grateful that we can do this 
in such a pleasant, such a wonderful atmosphere and that we can see each 
other here again. And I must say that I'm, again, very grateful to you, 
Mr. President, for the fact that we can have this exchange of views--and 
to you, Laura, as well. Thank you.
    President Bush. Thank you. Here we go.

Note: The President spoke at 4:32 p.m. at the Bush Ranch. In his 
remarks, he referred to Joachim Sauer, husband of Chancellor Merkel. 
Chancellor Merkel spoke in German, and her remarks were translated by an 
interpreter.
