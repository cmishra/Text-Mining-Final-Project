Exchange With Reporters at the Demilitarized Zone in South Korea
July 11, 1993

    Q. So what do you think?
    The President. I think anyone who sees this would understand how 
important it is for us to stay strong on the issue of North Korea 
staying in the NPT and allowing those atomic energy inspectors back in 
there. And I think anyone who sees this would be proud of these young 
men in uniform for being here.

Note: The exchange began at 1:45 p.m. at a lookout post near Camp 
Bonifas.
