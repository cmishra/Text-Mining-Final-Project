Statement on Flooding in Texas
October 18, 1994

    My thoughts are with the people of Texas during this crisis. With 
the help of our team down in Texas, I will continue to monitor the 
situation closely.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
that the President directed Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, 
Small Business Administrator Phil Lader, and Federal Emergency 
Management Agency officials to travel to Texas to survey flood damage.
