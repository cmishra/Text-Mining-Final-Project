Remarks During a Tour of an Alternative Fuel Sources Exhibit in Abu 
Dhabi
January 14, 2008

    It's amazing, isn't it? This country has gotten its wealth from the 
ground and is now reinvesting in alternative forms of energy, sometimes 
joint venturing with U.S. institutions, like MIT.

[At this point, the tour continued, and no transcript was provided. The 
remarks continued as follows.]

    It's a modern society that is using its wealth not only to educate 
its people but to stay on the leading edge of technological change.
    And, Your Highness,<Crown Prince Muhammad bin Zayid Al 
Nuhayyan<ls-thn-eq> it's been an amazing experience for me. And I don't 
think most Americans understand the UAE. And I don't think most 
Americans understand that your education systems are modern and that 
you're thinking about the future in constructive ways. I appreciate the 
chance to learn about you.

[The tour continued, and no transcript was provided. The remarks later 
concluded as follows.]

    My hope is my visit shines a spotlight on the Middle East, the 
opportunities to work constructively with our friends and allies, and 
shows people the truth about what life is like here in the UAE. This is 
a remarkable place. The architecture is beautiful, but the can-do spirit 
is amazing.
    And we just heard a briefing about how they're going to construct a 
city based entirely upon renewable energy. It is--it will be an 
opportunity to see what works, what won't work, and an opportunity to 
share that technology with others.
    And I appreciate the commitment to conservation and to the 
environment that the leadership has shown here. This has been a very 
interesting experience. I can't thank you enough for your hospitality.

Note: The President spoke at 9:37 a.m. at the Emirates Palace Hotel. In 
his remarks, he referred to Crown Prince Muhammad bin Zayid Al Nuhayyan 
of Abu Dhabi.
