Statement on the Circuit Court of Appeals Decision in the Elian 
Gonzalez<Gonzalez, Elian<ls-thn-eq> Case
June 1, 2000

    I am pleased with the decision today of the Eleventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals. As I have said before, this is a case about the importance 
of family and the bond between a father and son. I have supported the 
Justice Department's conclusion that Elian's father, Juan Miguel 
Gonzalez,<Gonzalez, Juan Miguel<ls-thn-eq> is the one best suited to 
speak for his child, and I am pleased that the court has upheld the 
Justice Department's determination.

Note: The statement referred to Cuban youth Elian Gonzalez, rescued off 
the coast of Florida on November 25, 1999, whose custody the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service decided in favor of his Cuban father.
