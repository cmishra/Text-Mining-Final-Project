Statement on Signing Legislation Authorizing United States Payments to 
the United Nations
October 5, 2001

    Today I am pleased to sign into law S. 248, which authorizes U.S. 
payments to the United Nations. This payment constitutes the second of 
three payments of arrears. When I met with U.N. Secretary General Kofi 
Annan<Annan, Kofi> in March, I told him that the United States 
was committed to paying the arrears it owes to the United Nations. 
Today, I am glad to take this important step towards fulfilling that 
commitment.
    As the world's preeminent multilateral institution, the United 
Nations plays a critical role in defusing international crises, 
resolving longstanding conflicts, and alleviating suffering, poverty, 
and disease. The United Nations also has a vital role in cracking down 
on violators of international law and eliminating sources of funding for 
terrorist operations.
    This release of funds will enhance the close bond between the United 
States and the United Nations, and will help to facilitate the work the 
United States carries out in concert with other U.N. members.
    In making these funds available, Republicans and Democrats in the 
Congress have again demonstrated their willingness to work together in a 
constructive manner to address our Nation's challenges at this important 
time in our history. I would like to pay a special tribute to Senators 
Helms and Biden, whose leadership has served as a catalyst for U.N. 
reform, and provided a means for the United States to fulfill its 
international obligations. I also wish to thank Representatives Hyde and 
Lantos, who have worked in a bipartisan manner toward making this 
payment to the United Nations a reality.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 October 5, 2001.

Note: S. 248, approved October 5, was assigned Public Law No. 107-46.
