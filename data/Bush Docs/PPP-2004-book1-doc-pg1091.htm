Remarks in Seattle, Washington, on the Death of Paul Johnson
June 18, 2004

    I want to express my deepest condolences to the family of Paul 
Johnson. We send our prayers and sympathies to them during this very 
troubling time.
    The murder of Paul shows the evil nature of the enemy we face. These 
are barbaric people. There's no justification whatsoever for his murder, 
and yet they killed him in cold blood. And it should remind us that we 
must pursue these people and bring them to justice before they hurt 
other Americans. See, they're trying to intimidate America. They're 
trying to shake our will. They're trying to get us to retreat from the 
world. America will not retreat. America will not be intimidated by 
these kinds of extremist thugs.
    May God bless Paul Johnson. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:54 p.m. at Boeing Field/King County 
International Airport prior to his departure for Reno, NV. In his 
remarks, he referred to Paul Johnson, a U.S. citizen employed in Saudi 
Arabia who was killed by members of the Al Qaida terrorist organization 
earlier in the day. A tape was not available for verification of the 
content of these remarks.
