Remarks Following a Briefing on Tornado Damage in Enterprise, Alabama
March 3, 2007

    You know, Mayor,<Boswell, Kenneth W.<ls-thn-eq> I told the people 
yesterday that I come down with a heavy heart, and I will try, to the 
best of my ability, to comfort those who lost life and property. I know 
you and your council and the citizens here have done that as well.
    I hope it helps for the citizens here to hear that we declared your 
county a major disaster area, which will provide some relief. You can 
never heal a heart, but you can provide comfort, knowing that the 
Federal Government will provide help for those whose houses were 
destroyed or automobiles were destroyed. And I would strongly urge the 
citizens here to--if you've got a question, to call 1-800-621-FEMA, and 
there will be somebody answering your call and will give you a chance to 
find out whether or not you will qualify for the relief under the major 
disaster declaration.
    Secondly, I was talking to the Governor,<Riley, Bob<ls-thn-eq> and 
he has said that there have been some funds set up to help the people 
who suffered. And my call to people here in Alabama and around the 
United States is, if you feel the generosity in your heart to help 
people affected by this terrible tornado, I would ask you to contribute. 
One such fund is the Red Cross. There will be others. We will make sure 
that USA Freedom Corps will have posted on it a place where people can 
contribute money. Some people are going to need your help. There have 
been some poor citizens who may or may not qualify for Federal help, but 
are going to need the help of our fellow citizens. And I would ask you 
to, out of the generosity of your heart, to help the folks down here.
    This storm is a tough storm. It went 8 miles and affected a lot of 
lives. And this country is a prayerful country. There are a lot of 
people praying for you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:40 a.m. at Enterprise Municipal Airport. 
In his remarks, he referred to Mayor Kenneth W. Boswell of Enterprise, 
AL; and Gov. Robert R. Riley of Alabama.
