Statement on the Situation in East Timor
September 10, 1999

    Let me address the deteriorating situation in East Timor. I am 
alarmed by reports I have just received of attacks on the United Nations 
compound in Dili.
    It is now clear that the Indonesian military is aiding and abetting 
the militia violence. This is simply unacceptable. The actions of the 
Indonesian military in East Timor stand in stark contrast to the 
commitments they have given to the international community.
    The Indonesian Government and military must reverse this course to 
do everything possible to stop the violence and allow an international 
force to make possible the restoration of security.
