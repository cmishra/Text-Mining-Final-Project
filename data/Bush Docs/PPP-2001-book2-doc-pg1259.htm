Statement on Russia's Decision To Close a Military Intelligence Facility 
in Lourdes, Cuba
October 17, 2001

    I welcome President Putin's<Putin, Vladimir> announcement 
today that Russia will close its military intelligence-gathering 
facility in Lourdes, Cuba. This decision is another indication that the 
cold war is over. President Putin understands that Russia and America 
are no longer adversaries; we do not judge our successes by how much it 
complicates life for the other country. Instead, both nations are taking 
down relics of the cold war and building a new, cooperative, and 
transparent relationship for the 21st century.
    I look forward to meeting with President Putin<Putin, 
Vladimir> in Shanghai on Sunday, where we will work to deepen 
the Russian-American partnership.
