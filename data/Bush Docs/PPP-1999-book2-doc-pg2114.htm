Statement on the Texas A&M University Bonfire Tower Tragedy
November 19, 1999

    Today I spoke with Dr. Ray Bowen,<Bowen, Ray> president of 
Texas A&M University, to extend my deepest sympathies on the tragedy 
that occurred at the campus. This is a heartbreaking loss. America 
stands with the College Station community as it joins together during 
this difficult time. Hillary and I offer our thoughts and prayers to the 
families and friends of those who were injured or killed in this 
devastating incident.
