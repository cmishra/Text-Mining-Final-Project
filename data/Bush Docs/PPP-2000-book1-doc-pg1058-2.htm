Statement on the Death of Governor Robert P. Casey<Casey, Robert 
P.<ls-thn-eq>
May 31, 2000

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Governor Bob 
Casey. Over the many years I knew him, I came to admire his toughness, 
tenacity, and commitment to principle. Those are the qualities that 
helped the son of a mule tender in the coal mines of northeastern 
Pennsylvania lead a life of dedicated public service, culminating in two 
successful terms as Governor.
    Throughout his career, Bob fought tirelessly for the people of 
Pennsylvania, never losing sight of the poor and their children. That

devotion was reflected in his support of universal health care, tougher 
environmental laws, expanded educational opportunity, and strong labor 
protections.
    As Governors, Bob and I worked together on many of these causes. And 
when we disagreed, I understood that his views were based on deep 
religious beliefs and a commitment to his convictions.
    Hillary and I send our thoughts and prayers to his wife, 
Ellen,<Casey, Ellen<ls-thn-eq> and the entire Casey family.
