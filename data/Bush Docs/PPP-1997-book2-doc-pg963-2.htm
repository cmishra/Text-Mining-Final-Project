Statement on the Resignation of Walter Dellinger as Solicitor General
July 16, 1997

    With deep regret, I accept the resignation of Walter Dellinger as 
Solicitor General. Walter Dellinger has been an outstanding advocate for 
the American people. He has fought tirelessly and courageously for the 
rights of all Americans. He has represented this country in some of the 
most important cases ever decided by the United States Supreme Court, 
and in each case, worked hard to assure that the Court understood the 
national interest and not just the particular interests of the selected 
few. Walter is one of Nation's most brilliant constitutional scholars, 
and I know his students are delighted that he will return to teaching. 
But we will miss his talent, his leadership, his energy, and his sense 
of justice.
