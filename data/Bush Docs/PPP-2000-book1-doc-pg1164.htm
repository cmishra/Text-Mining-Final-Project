Statement on Senate Action on Electronic Signatures Legislation
June 16, 2000

    I am pleased that the Senate today adopted the electronic signatures 
conference report by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. I look forward to 
signing this important legislation into law as soon as possible.
    This landmark legislation will ensure that consumer protections 
remain strong in the technology age. It will help create new rules of 
the road for America's hi-tech economy. E-commerce helps strengthen our 
economy by lowering inflation, raising productivity, and spurring new 
research and development. By marrying one of our oldest values--our 
commitment to consumer protection--with the newest technologies, we can 
achieve the full measure of the benefits that E-commerce has to offer.
    My congratulations to the Democratic and Republican leaders of the 
conference committee for their hard work on this legislation.
