will give us a chance

to continue to strengthen this very important relationship. And I agree 
with you; it's a relationship where we've got common interests. We don't 
agree on every issue, but we do agree we should discuss our differences 
and our likenesses in a cordial manner.
    And so I look forward to this meeting a lot. Thank you for having 
us.
