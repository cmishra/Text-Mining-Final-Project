Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Peacekeeping 
Operations in Kosovo
November 2, 2001

Dear __________ :
    As required by section 1213 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, Public Law 106-398, I transmit 
herewith a semiannual report on the contributions of European nations 
and organizations to the peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.
    This report, prepared by the Department of State, concludes that the 
Europeans have carried a significant portion of the aid-sharing burden 
in the region and that their commitment to reconstruction, humanitarian 
relief, and institution and peace-building has been a strong one. 
Continued attention and commitments of assistance from all donors 
remains crucial for medium- and long-term development in Kosovo.
        Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Joseph R. Biden, Jr., chairman, and 
Jesse Helms, ranking member, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations; Carl 
Levin, chairman, and John W. Warner, ranking member, Senate Committee on 
Armed Services; Robert C. Byrd, chairman, and Ted Stevens, ranking 
member, Senate Committee on Appropriations; Henry J. Hyde, chairman, and 
Tom Lantos, ranking member, House Committee on International Relations; 
Bob Stump, chairman, and Ike Skelton, ranking member, House Committee on 
Armed Services; and C.W. Bill Young, chairman, and David R. Obey, 
ranking member, House Committee on Appropriations.
