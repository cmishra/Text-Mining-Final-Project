Statement on the Resignation of the Deputy Secretary of State
November 8, 1993

    I accept with regret the resignation offered today by Clifton 
Wharton, who has served our country honorably as Deputy Secretary of 
State. My administration has benefited greatly from his dignified 
presence, and it will be diminished by his departure.

    Clifton Wharton's service as Deputy Secretary has been outstanding. 
Over the past 10 months, he has made many important contributions to our 
Nation's foreign policy. Through his leadership on reform of AID and 
other foreign assistance programs and his important work on the 
reorganization of the State Department, as well as through his 
successful mission to Southeast Asia and his prodigious efforts in Latin 
America, he has distinguished himself at every turn. Every aspect of his 
service has demonstrated the same drive and talent that marked his 
earlier successes in the worlds of business and education.

    I know that Cliff is dedicated to our country's service. I continue 
to need and value his insights and counsel, and I hope to be able to 
continue calling on him for specific assignments in the days ahead. He 
and his family have my fondest wishes for a successful future.
