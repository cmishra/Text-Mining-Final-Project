Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on Partial-Birth Abortion
April 18, 2007

    I am pleased that the Supreme Court upheld a law that prohibits the 
abhorrent procedure of partial-birth abortion. Today's decision affirms 
that the Constitution does not stand in the way of the people's 
representatives enacting laws reflecting the compassion and humanity of 
America. The partial-birth abortion ban, which an overwhelming 
bipartisan majority in Congress passed and I signed into law, represents 
a commitment to building a culture of life in America.
    The Supreme Court's decision is an affirmation of the progress we 
have made over the past 6 years in protecting human dignity and 
upholding the sanctity of life. We will continue to work for the day 
when every child is welcomed in life and protected in law.
