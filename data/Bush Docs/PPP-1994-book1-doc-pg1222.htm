Statement on the Resignation of National AIDS Policy Coordinator 
Kristine Gebbie
July 8, 1994

    Kristine Gebbie, the first National AIDS Policy Coordinator, served 
ably and with dedication as a member of our administration. With her 
help, the Federal Government finally began exercising real leadership in 
response to this terrible epidemic. Working together, we boosted funding 
for the Ryan White Care Act, increased resources for prevention and 
research, sped the research and approval process for new drugs, and 
required every Federal employee to receive comprehensive workplace 
education. While more needs to be done--and more will be done--to fight 
AIDS, Kristine Gebbie's service as the Nation's first AIDS Policy 
Coordinator gave this vitally important battle a lift when one was 
desperately needed and long overdue.

Note: A statement by Kristine Gebbie was also made available by the 
Office of the Press Secretary.
