Statement on Legislation To Implement the Community and Faith-Based 
Initiative
February 5, 2003

    I applaud the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of 
Senators Grassley<Grassley, Chuck> and Baucus,<Baucus, 
Max> for moving quickly on a key component of bipartisan 
faith-based legislation sponsored by Senators Santorum<Santorum, 
Rick> and Lieberman.<Lieberman, Joseph I.> Today's 
action brings us one step closer to creating incentives for Americans to 
donate more to charities, many of which are facing tough financial 
times. We must also work to level the playing field for community and 
faith-based organizations that provide effective social services to our 
fellow citizens who are in need. I look forward to working closely with 
the Senate and House to improve the legislation to get a strong, 
bipartisan faith-based bill on my desk as soon as possible. Together, we 
can help encourage acts of compassion that can transform our Nation, one 
heart and one soul at a time.
