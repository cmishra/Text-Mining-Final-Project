Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on Physician-Assisted Suicide
June 26, 1997

    I am very pleased with today's Supreme Court decision which accepted 
my administration's position that States may ban physician-assisted 
suicide. The decision is a victory for all Americans--it prevents us 
from going down a very dangerous and troubling path on this difficult 
and often agonizing issue.

    With today's decision, the Court voices its concern that there is a 
significant distinction between assisting in death and allowing death to 
occur. Not only is this an important legal distinction, it is also a 
distinction of deep moral and ethical implications.
    I have a great deal of sympathy and a profound respect for those who 
suffer from incurable illnesses and for their families. I have had a 
number of family members die from painful and protracted illnesses. Even 
so, I have always expressed my strong opposition to physician-assisted 
suicide. I believe that it is wrong and have always believed it to be 
wrong.
    This issue is unavoidably heart-rendering, and we must never ignore 
the agony of terminally ill patients, but the Supreme Court made the 
right decision today. The risks and consequences of physician-assisted 
suicide are simply too great.
