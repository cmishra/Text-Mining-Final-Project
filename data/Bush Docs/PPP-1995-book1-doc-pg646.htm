Statement on Gun-Free School Zones
May 5, 1995

    In my radio address last week, I asked the Attorney General to 
recommend what constitutional steps I could take to ensure that guns are 
kept away from our children's schools. The Attorney General has 
responded to my request, and next week I will submit legislation to 
Congress that will put the gun-free school zones act on firm 
constitutional ground. This legislation is the most straightforward 
option available and must be acted on immediately. I am determined to 
keep guns away from schools and am committed to working with the 
Congress to make our schools safe havens where young people can learn 
and grow free from harm.
