Message to the Congress on Export of Accelerometers to the People's 
Republic of China
December 14, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom 
Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public 
Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export of 36 accelerometers to 
the People's Republic of China's Ministry of Railways, for use in a 
railroad track geometry measuring system, is not detrimental to the U.S. 
space launch industry, and that the material and equipment, including 
any indirect technical benefit that

[[Page 1861]]

could be derived from such export, will not measurably improve the 
missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 December 14, 2005.
