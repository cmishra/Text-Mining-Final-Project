Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on the Emigration Policies 
and Trade Status of Albania
July 19, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:
    I am submitting an updated report to the Congress concerning the 
emigration laws and

policies of Albania. The report indicates continued Albanian compliance 
with U.S. and international standards in the area of emigration. In

fact, Albania has imposed no emigration restrictions, including exit 
visa requirements, on its population since 1991.
    On December 5, 1997, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Albania is not in violation of the freedom-of-emigration criteria in 
sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. That action allowed for 
the continuation of normal trade relations status for Albania and 
certain other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver. 
This semiannual report is submitted as required by law pursuant to the 
determination of December 5, 1997.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 19, 1999.
