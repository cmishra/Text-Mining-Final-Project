Memorandum on Federal Employees Affected by California Floods
March 17, 1995

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Excused Absence for Employees Affected by Widespread Flooding 
in California

    I am deeply concerned about the devastating losses caused by 
widespread flooding in California and the impact on the well-being and 
livelihood of our fellow Americans who have been affected by this 
disaster. Many parts of the Federal Government have been mobilized to 
respond to this disaster.
    As part of this effort, I request heads of executive departments and 
agencies who have Federal civilian employees in the areas designated as 
disaster areas because of the flooding to use their discretion to excuse 
from duty, without charge to leave or loss of pay, any such employee who 
is faced with a personal emergency because of the flooding and who can 
be spared from his or her usual responsibilities. This policy should 
also be applied to any employee who is needed for emergency law 
enforcement, relief, or clean-up efforts authorized by Federal, State, 
or local officials having jurisdiction.

                                                      William J. Clinton
