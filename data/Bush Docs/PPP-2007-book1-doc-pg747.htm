Remarks Following a Meeting With Military Leaders
June 14, 2007

    It's been my honor to receive General Dempsey<Dempsey, Martin 
E.<ls-thn-eq> and his wife<Dempsey, Deanie<ls-thn-eq> here to the Oval 
Office to thank both of them for their service to the country. General 
Dempsey has just come out of Iraq, where he is working with the Iraqi 
troops to prepare for--to prepare them for the day when they will be 
responsible for the security of their country. He explained to me the 
progress that has been made over the years that he has been there. 
Obviously, we have still more work to do.
    But I--my main purpose of inviting the general<Dempsey, Martin 
E.<ls-thn-eq> here is to hear his summary, but to thank him. It's an 
extraordinary country where people volunteer to go into combat zones to 
protect the security of the United States of America. No more important 
mission for our military than Iraq and Afghanistan.
    And General Dempsey<Dempsey, Martin E.<ls-thn-eq> and his family 
have been very much involved in this war on terror. And we appreciate 
you and thank you and wish you all the best in your next assignment.
    Thanks for being here.

 Note:  The President spoke at 10:22 a.m. in the Oval Office at the 
White House. Participating in the meeting were Vice President Dick 
Cheney; Gen. Peter Pace, USMC, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Lt. 
Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, USA, former commander, Multi-National Security 
Transition Command--Iraq, and his wife Deanie.
