Radio Remarks on Sightseeing Flights Over the Grand Canyon
March 28, 2000

    There may be no place on Earth more stunning than the Grand Canyon. 
It's important to preserve and protect it, so that the millions who 
visit each year can enjoy the Canyon in all its

splendor. Today I am announcing an important new measure to carefully 
manage sightseeing flights over the Grand Canyon. With this action, we 
can allow continued access to all, while also helping to restore the 
natural quiet of this timeless treasure.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 8 p.m. on 
March 17 in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast. The 
transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on March 
28. These remarks were also made available on the White House Press 
Office Actuality Line.
