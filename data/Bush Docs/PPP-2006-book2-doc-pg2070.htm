Statement on the Death of Ed Bradley<Bradley, Ed<ls-thn-eq>
November 9, 2006

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of Ed Bradley. For over 40 years, the American people have turned to Ed 
as a trusted source of information about events that have shaped our 
Nation. From serving as a White House correspondent to his many years as 
a journalist for a television newsmagazine, he produced distinctive 
investigative reports that inspired action and cemented his reputation 
as one of the most accomplished journalists of our time.
    Today our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Bradley's family and 
colleagues.
