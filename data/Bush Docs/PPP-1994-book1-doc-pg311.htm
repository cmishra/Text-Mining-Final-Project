Statement on the Nomination of Jamie Gorelick To Be 
Deputy Attorney General
February 23, 1994

    I applaud Attorney General Reno's choice of Jamie Gorelick to be the 
next Deputy Attorney General for the Department of Justice.
    She has ably served my administration with great distinction as 
General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and I am confident Jamie 
will continue to bring her sharp legal mind, penetrating analysis, and 
tremendous management capabilities to her newest assignment.
    I look forward to working closely with Attorney General Reno and 
Jamie Gorelick in fighting for passage of a tough, smart crime bill and 
to give the American people a Justice Department that is innovative in 
its approaches and solutions for crime reduction and law enforcement.
