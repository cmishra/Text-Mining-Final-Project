Statement on Congressional Action on Electronic Signatures Legislation
June 8, 2000

    I am pleased that House and Senate conferees have reached bipartisan 
agreement on important electronic commerce legislation, the ``Electronic 
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.'' This legislation will 
remove legal barriers to doing business on-line while preserving 
consumer protections. Congress should quickly send the bill to my desk.
    E-commerce offers substantial benefits for businesses and consumers 
in terms of efficiency, convenience, and lower costs and is a vital 
source of dynamism for the American economy. If we are to achieve the 
full potential of electronic business-to-business and business-to-
consumer commerce, however, some minimal ground rules are necessary. 
Business needs legal certainty that a contract formed and executed on-
line will be no less valid than its pen-and-ink counterpart. Consumers 
need confidence that they are as safe doing business in the electronic 
world as they are on paper.
    The bipartisan agreement reached by conferees is a responsible and 
balanced approach to accomplishing both of these goals. The legislation 
would remove barriers to E-commerce by establishing technology-neutral 
legal standards for electronic contracts and signatures. It would ensure 
that consumer protections on-line will be equivalent to those in the 
paper world.
    I applaud the leadership of Chairmen Bliley<Bliley, Tom<ls-thn-eq> 
and McCain<McCain, John<ls-thn-eq> who reached across party lines and 
built a bipartisan consensus. I am also grateful to the Democrats who 
worked so constructively to reach bipartisan agreement in conference, 
including Senators Hollings,<Hollings, Ernest F.<ls-thn-eq> 
Leahy,<Leahy, Patrick J.<ls-thn-eq> Sarbanes,<Sarbanes, Paul 
S.<ls-thn-eq> and Wyden<Wyden, Ron<ls-thn-eq> and Congressmen 
Dingell<Dingell, John D.<ls-thn-eq> and Markey.<Markey, Edward 
J.<ls-thn-eq>
