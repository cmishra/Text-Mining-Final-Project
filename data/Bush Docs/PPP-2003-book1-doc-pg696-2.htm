Statement on Congressional Action on the Keeping Children and Families 
Safe Act of 2003
June 25, 2003

    I commend Congress for passing the Keeping Children and Families 
Safe Act of 2003 and am pleased to sign it into law.
    The act will allow us to strengthen State and community-based 
programs that prevent child abuse and family violence and treat victims. 
In addition, the legislation will help us keep children safe by 
requiring criminal background checks for foster and adoptive parents. It 
also provides additional resources to increase the number of older 
children placed in adoptive families.

Note: S. 342, approved June 25, was assigned Public Law No. 108-36.
