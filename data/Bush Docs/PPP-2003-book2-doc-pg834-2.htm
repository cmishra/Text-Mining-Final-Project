Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting Proposed Legislative 
Changes To Implement the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement
July 3, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    On May 6, 2003, I signed the United States-Singapore Free Trade 
Agreement. Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 
2002 (Public Law 107-210), I am submitting a description of the changes 
to existing laws, prepared by my Administration, that would be required 
to bring the United States into compliance with that Agreement.
    I look forward to working with the Congress in developing 
legislation to implement this important Free Trade Agreement.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
