Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Cuba
February 25, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the emergency declared with respect to the Government of Cuba's 
destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba on February 24, 1996, is to 
continue in effect beyond March 1, 2000.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
