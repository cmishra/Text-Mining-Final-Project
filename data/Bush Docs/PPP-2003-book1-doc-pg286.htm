Remarks Following a Meeting With Congressional Leaders and an Exchange 
With Reporters
March 21, 2003

    The President. I've asked the Members of Congress to come up so that 
members of my administration can keep the leadership up to date as the 
war to liberate Iraq and to remove weapons of mass destruction out of 
Iraq proceeds. The military briefings, of course, will continue to be 
given out of the Pentagon. Secretary Rumsfeld<Rumsfeld, Donald 
H.> will be briefing this afternoon.
    I also really want to thank Members of Congress, both House Members, 
Senate Members, members of both political parties, for the strong 
resolutions that came off the floor of their respective bodies, 
resolutions which said loud and clear: Our country supports the men and 
women in uniform; not only do we support those brave souls who are 
sacrificing on our behalf, but we want to thank their parents and their 
families for their dedication as well.
    As Secretary Rumsfeld<Rumsfeld, Donald H.> said, we're 
making progress. We will stay on task until we've achieved our 
objective, which is to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction and free 
the Iraqi people so they can live in a society that is hopeful and 
democratic and at peace in its neighborhood.
    All of us involved here in Washington are extremely proud of the 
skill and bravery of our young Americans who are willing to sacrifice 
for something greater than themselves.
    So it's my honor to welcome the Members here. We will continue to 
keep them briefed as this war progresses. And I want to thank them for 
the unity, the message of unity.
    Thank you all for coming.

Secretary Rumsfeld's<Rumsfeld, Donald H.> Briefing

    The President. Secretary Rumsfeld will be briefing today.
    Q. Do you want to give us any details, as the Commander in Chief, of 
how things are going?
