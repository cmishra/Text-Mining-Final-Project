Statement on the Verdict in the Matthew Shepard Murder Trial
November 3, 1999

    Today's verdict closes a chapter in the tragic story of the killing 
of Matthew Shepard. Although the verdict cannot bring Matthew back, 
perhaps it will bring some sense of closure to Dennis<Shepard, 
Dennis> and Judy Shepard,<Shepard, Judy> as well as 
other family and friends of Matthew. The First Lady and I offer our 
prayers for them and our hope that their memories of Matthew's life will 
sustain them in the difficult time ahead.
    The verdict is a dramatic statement that we are determined to have a 
tolerant, law-abiding nation that celebrates our differences rather than 
despising them. Our Nation must unite in outrage against hate-based 
violence. We cannot surrender to those on the fringe of our society who 
lash out at those who are different. Their crimes impose a particular 
cost on society by tearing at the social fabric. It is my continued hope 
that together, as a nation, we will work to repair that fabric.
