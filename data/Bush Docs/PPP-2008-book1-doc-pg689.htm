Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Burma
May 16, 2008

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal 
Register for publication, stating that the Burma emergency is to 
continue beyond May 20, 2008.
    The crisis between the United States and Burma arising from the 
actions and policies of the Government of Burma, including its engaging 
in large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma, that 
led to the declaration of a national emergency on May 20, 1997, and its 
expansion on October 18, 2007, and April 30, 2008, has not been 
resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests and 
pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, I 
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency 
with respect to Burma and maintain in force the sanctions against Burma 
to respond to this threat. This action does not inhibit any efforts on 
the part of the United States to

provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma in the aftermath 
of Cyclone Nargis.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 May 16, 2008.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
May 17. The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
