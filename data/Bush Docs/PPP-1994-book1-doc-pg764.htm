Statement on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program
April 22, 1994

    When people enter this country illegally and commit crimes while 
they are here, it is not fair to ask the States to bear the entire cost 
of their imprisonment. This new program will help them considerably.
    After many years of virtual neglect of the illegal immigration 
issue, our administration is taking major steps to address this problem. 
First, we are making a substantial investment in efforts to reduce the 
flow of illegal immigration, primarily by toughening our border 
enforcement. That is the Federal Government's primary responsibility in 
this area.
    But we also need to help those States with large numbers of 
undocumented aliens to shoulder the resulting financial burdens. Today, 
we take another important step in that direction.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the creation of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program to assist 
States with the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens convicted of a 
felony.
