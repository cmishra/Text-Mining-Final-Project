Statement on the World Trade Organization's Decision To Launch a New 
Round of Global Trade Negotiations
November 14, 2001

    I commend the decision by the world's trading nations meeting in 
Qatar to launch a new round of global trade negotiations. This bold 
declaration of hope by the World Trade Organization (WTO) has the 
potential to expand prosperity and development throughout the world and 
revitalize the global economy. It also sends a powerful signal that the 
world's trading nations support peaceful and open exchange and reject 
the forces of fear and protectionism.
    Today's action advances the United States agenda to liberalize world 
trade--something that will benefit all Americans. By promoting open 
trade, we expand export markets and create high-paying jobs for American 
workers and farmers, while providing more choices and lower prices for 
goods and services for American families.
    Today's decision offers fresh hope for the world's developing 
nations, with whom the United States worked closely in crafting an 
agenda for trade negotiations. It reflects our common understanding that 
a new trade round can give developing countries greater access to world 
markets and lift the lives of millions now living in poverty. In 
addition, the WTO meeting affirmed the commitment of all nations to help 
end the scourge of health pandemics such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
malaria by highlighting rules governing access to lifesaving medicines.
    I also commend the historic decision to welcome into the WTO the 
People's Republic of China and Taiwan, united in their commitment to 
expand shared rules and opportunity to all members. I thank Ambassador 
Zoellick,<Zoellick, Robert B.> Secretary Veneman,<Veneman, Ann 
M.> and Secretary Evans<Evans, Donald L.> for their 
skill in helping WTO members reach this accord, as well as the select 
corps of U.S. Government negotiators who assisted them.
    The WTO leadership, particularly Director-General Moore,<Moore, 
Mike> did a superb job of laying the groundwork for the 
ministerial. I also thank the Government of Qatar, the

WTO Ministerial chairman Finance Minister Kamal,<Kamal, Youssef 
Hussein> and the people of Qatar for being model hosts and 
doing so much to achieve this successful outcome.

Note: The statement referred to WTO Director-General Mike Moore; and 
Finance Minister Youssef Hussein Kamal of Qatar.
