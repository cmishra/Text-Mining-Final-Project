Message on the Observance of Christmas, 1997
December 22, 1997

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Christmas.
    At this time of year, when the nights grow longer and often colder, 
our lives are brightened and our hearts warmed by the lights of 
Christmas. So much light surrounds our memories and celebration of 
Christmas: candlelight in the windows, colored lights twinkling on the 
tree,

children's faces lit with a joy that is reflected in their parents' 
eyes. The beloved Christmas story itself is a story of light, for, as 
the Gospel of John tells us, Jesus came into the world as ``the true 
Light'' that illumines all humankind.
    Almost 2,000 years later, that Light still shines amid the dark 
places of our world. It is reflected in the lives of so many quiet and 
generous people who strive daily to make life better for others--feeding 
the hungry, caring for the ill and elderly, cherishing and nurturing 
children. It radiates from the hearts of those who work for peace and 
justice in their communities, our nation, and the world. It shines in 
the efforts of men and women striving to break down the walls of fear, 
ignorance, and prejudice that cast shadows across too many lives and 
prevent us from becoming the people God intended us to be.
    May all who celebrate Christmas this year rejoice in the special 
gifts of light that it brings: the love that warms our hearts, the faith 
that lights our journey, and the hope that promises us a bright future. 
Hillary and I wish you joy and peace during this Christmas season and 
much happiness in the New Year.

                                                            Bill Clinton
