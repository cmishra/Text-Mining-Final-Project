Statement on Proposed Legislation To Implement the Faith-Based 
Initiative
March 21, 2001

    Earlier this year, I sent to the Congress my agenda to rally 
America's armies of compassion to address many of our toughest community 
challenges.
    Government does not have a monopoly on compassion. And while 
Government cannot be replaced by charities, it should welcome them as 
partners, not view them as rivals.
    Today, on a bipartisan basis, Members of the House and Senate took 
important first steps to advance this agenda to aid churches, 
synagogues, mosques, and communities in helping neighbors in need.
    I welcome the bipartisan proposals that have been offered in the 
House by Representative J.C. Watts,<Watts, J.C., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> 
Representative Tony Hall,<Hall, Tony P.<ls-thn-eq> and Speaker Dennis 
Hastert,<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> and in the Senate by Senator Rick 
Santorum<Santorum, Rick<ls-thn-eq> and Senator Joseph 
Lieberman.<Lieberman, Joseph I.<ls-thn-eq> These new legislative 
initiatives demonstrate that momentum continues to build behind my 
agenda to rally America's armies of compassion. They represent a 
bipartisan consensus that Government must support our quiet heroes who 
are lifting lives and healing neighborhoods one heart and one act of 
kindness at a time.
    I will continue to work in a bipartisan fashion with Congress to 
help those most in need by encouraging charitable giving and eliminating 
barriers to charitable works.
