Message to the Senate Transmitting an Amendment to the Montreal Protocol 
on Ozone-Depleting Substances
September 16, 1999

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, the Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that 
Deplete the Ozone Layer (the ``Montreal Protocol''), adopted at Montreal 
on September 15-17, 1997, by the Ninth Meeting of the Parties to the 
Montreal Protocol. The report of the Department of State is also 
enclosed for the information of the Senate.
    The principal features of the 1997 Amendment, which was negotiated 
under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), are 
the addition of methyl bromide

[[Page 1551]]

to the substances that are subject to trade control with non-Parties; 
and the addition of a licensing requirement for import and export of 
controlled substances. The 1997 Amendment will constitute a major step 
forward in protecting public health and the environment from potential 
adverse effects of stratospheric ozone depletion.
    By its terms, the 1997 Amendment was to have entered into force on 
January 1, 1999, provided that at least 20 states had deposited their 
instruments of ratification, acceptance, or approval. However, because 
this condition was not met until August 12, 1999, the 1997 Amendment 
will enter into force on November 10, 1999.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the 1997 Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and give its advice and 
consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

September 16, 1999.
