Remarks on the Death of Former White House Press Secretary Tony 
Snow<Snow, Tony<ls-thn-eq>
July 13, 2008

    Well, we had some bad news this weekend. Our good friend Tony Snow 
passed away. Tony, you know, worked with us and made a lot of friends 
here in the White House. And Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are--
we're really saddened by his death.
    I came to know Tony as a very smart and capable man. He had good 
values. He was an honest guy. You know, he had a wonderful sense of 
humor. He loved to laugh, he loved his country, and he loved his family.

    And our thoughts are with Jill<Snow, Jill<ls-thn-eq> and the<Snow, 
Kendall<ls-thn-eq> three<Snow, Kristin<ls-thn-eq> children<Snow, 
Robbie<ls-thn-eq> now as they deal with their grief. We went to church 
this morning at Camp David, and I prayed for Jill and the family, that 
they would have--find comfort and strength during this tough time for 
them. And I just hope they understand that Tony was loved here in the 
White House, and a lot of those who, you know, got to know him really do 
care about Jill and the kids.
    So anyway, thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:50 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House.
