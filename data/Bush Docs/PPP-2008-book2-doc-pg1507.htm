Remarks Following a Visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and an 
Exchange With Reporters
December 22, 2008

    The President. Every time I come here, I get amazed at the quality 
of care, the professionalism, and the courage of our troops. I can say 
with certainty that the health care that our troops get in the military 
medical facilities is excellent. I am so pleased to hear from spouses 
and other loved ones about the care they get as well, when they come to 
visit their wounded child or wounded husband or wounded spouse.
    And so this will probably be my last time coming here as the 
Commander in Chief. It gives me a great pleasure to thank all those who 
serve here and all those who serve throughout our military, the military 
medical facilities. You know, I oftentimes say being the Commander in 
Chief of the military is the thing I'll miss the most, and coming here 
to Walter Reed is a reminder of why I'll miss it.
    Thank you very much.

President's Health

    Q. How is your shoulder, Mr. President?
    The President. Yes, good shape, it's about an 80-mile-an-hour 
fastball.

Note: The President spoke at 3:03 p.m.
