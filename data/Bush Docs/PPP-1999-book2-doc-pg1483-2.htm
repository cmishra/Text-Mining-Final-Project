Radio Remarks on Reducing Drunk Driving
August 28, 1999

    Working together, we've made enormous progress in reducing drunk 
driving in America. Today I'm pleased to report we're making even more. 
Last year the number of people killed in alcohol-related crashes hit a 
record low, and young people killed in alcohol-related crashes fell to 
the lowest rate ever recorded. But even one child killed because of 
drunk driving is one too many.
    Today I'm pleased to announce the Departments of Transportation and 
Justice will release a total of over $47 million in grants to help 
communities combat drunk driving and underage drinking and increases 
seatbelt use. Ultimately, of course, all of us must take responsibility. 
So if you choose to drink, always designate a driver and always wear 
your seatbelt. Let's make this the safest Labor Day weekend ever.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 10:40 a.m. 
at Edgartown Elementary School in Martha's Vineyard, MA, for later 
broadcast. The transcript was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on September 2. These remarks were also made available on the 
White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
