Statement on Senate Passage of Appropriations Legislation
January 22, 2004

    I am pleased that the Senate has passed the omnibus budget bill, 
which fulfills important commitments like AIDS relief, education and DC 
school choice, veterans health care, law enforcement, and other 
priorities.
    This bill stays within the spending limits I proposed, which is 
necessary as we work to cut the deficit in half over the next 5 years. I 
will continue to work with the Congress to focus on priorities, cut 
wasteful spending, and be wise with the people's money. I look forward 
to signing this bill into law.
