Statement on Congressional Action on Intelligence Reform Legislation
January 24, 2008

    Last August, Congress passed the Protect America Act, which updated 
our foreign intelligence surveillance law to adapt to today's technology 
and to meet today's threats. This bipartisan legislation has aided our 
efforts to monitor the communications of terrorists and other foreign 
intelligence targets.
    Unfortunately, Congress set this legislation to expire on February 
1st. That is just 8 days from today, yet the threat from Al Qaida will 
not expire in 8 days.
    If Congress does not act quickly, our national security 
professionals will not be able to count on critical tools they need to 
protect our Nation, and our ability to respond quickly to new threats 
and circumstances will be weakened. That means it will become harder to 
figure out what our enemies are doing to recruit terrorists and 
infiltrate them into our country.
    Last fall, the Senate Intelligence Committee completed its work on a 
bipartisan bill to modernize our foreign intelligence surveillance law. 
I commend Senators Rockefeller<Rockefeller, John Davison ``Jay,'' 
IV<ls-thn-eq> and Bond,<Bond, Christopher S. ``Kit''<ls-thn-eq> the 
committee's chairman and vice chairman, for leading the effort to 
complete work on this bill.
    The Senate Intelligence Committee's bill contains many provisions 
that our intelligence officials say they need to protect our country. 
The bill would maintain the vital flow of intelligence on terrorist 
threats. It would protect the freedoms of Americans while making sure we 
do not extend those same protections to terrorists overseas. And it 
would provide liability protection to companies now facing billion-
dollar lawsuits only because they are believed to have assisted in 
efforts to defend our Nation following the 9/11 attacks.
    This bill still needs some changes, but I am optimistic that with 
good will on both sides, we can make those changes quickly. So I ask 
congressional leaders to follow the course set by their colleagues on 
the Senate Intelligence Committee, bring this legislation to a prompt 
vote in both houses, and send me a bill that I can sign before the 
Protect America Act expires on February 1st.

    Congress's action--or lack of action--on this important issue will 
directly affect our ability to keep Americans safe.
