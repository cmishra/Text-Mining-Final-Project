Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Temporary Transfer of the Powers 
and Duties of the President of the United States
July 21, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    This morning I will undergo a routine medical procedure requiring 
sedation. In view of present circumstances, I have determined to 
transfer temporarily my Constitutional powers and duties to the Vice 
President during the brief period of the procedure and recovery.
    In accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Twenty-Fifth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution, this letter shall 
constitute my written declaration that I am unable to discharge the 
Constitutional powers and duties of the office of the President of the 
United States. Pursuant to Section 3, the Vice President shall discharge 
those powers and duties as Acting President until I transmit to you a 
written declaration that I am able to resume the discharge of those 
powers and duties.

         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Robert C. Byrd, President pro tempore of the 
Senate.
