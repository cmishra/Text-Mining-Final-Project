Message on the Observance of Eid al-Adha
January 21, 2005

    I send greetings to Muslims around the world as you celebrate Eid 
al-Adha.
    Abraham's sacrifice and service to God teach us the importance of 
devotion, and God's mercy encourages us to share His blessings with 
others. The kindness and charity practiced by Muslims during this 
holiday strengthen friendships, help those in need, and exemplify the 
compassionate spirit that makes America and the world a better place.
    As Americans of Muslim faith celebrate Eid al-Adha, our Nation is 
reminded of the contributions that Muslim Americans have made to our 
religious and cultural heritage. Your values of family, service, and 
community enrich our society and reflect the ideals on which our country 
was founded.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a joyous celebration.

                                                          George W. Bush
