Statement on the Death of Joe Skeen<Skeen, Joe<ls-thn-eq>
December 8, 2003

    Joe Skeen was a dedicated public servant who worked tirelessly for 
the people of New Mexico. He led an extraordinary life, from his service 
in the Navy and the Air Force Reserves to his work and many 
contributions in the New Mexico State senate and the United States House 
of Representatives. He was a strong leader of conviction and principle. 
A good man, he will be missed by his many friends. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our condolences to his wife, Mary,<Skeen, 
Mary<ls-thn-eq> and their family and friends.
