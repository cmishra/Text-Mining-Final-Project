Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation To Promote 
African Growth and Opportunity
March 11, 1998

    In this year's State of the Union Address, I asked Congress to 
support an initiative to strengthen economic ties to Africa. Today, I am 
pleased that Congress has taken an important step forward on legislation 
that will open a new era of U.S.-African trade and investment relations. 
The strong bipartisan vote in the House in support of the ``African 
Growth and Opportunity Act'' offers the way for a brighter future for 
Africa.
    The United States has a vital stake in a stable, prosperous Africa. 
Later this month, when I travel to Africa, I will deliver the message 
that the United States stands ready to be a partner in Africa's 
prosperity. A majority of sub-Saharan Africa's 48 countries have adopted 
market-oriented economic and political reforms in the past

seven years. A stronger, stable, prosperous Africa will be a better 
economic partner, a better partner for security and peace, and a better 
partner in the fight against the new transnational threats of drug 
trafficking, crime, terrorism, the spread of disease and environmental 
degradation. This bill--by significantly broadening market access, 
spurring growth in Africa, and helping the poorest nations eliminate or 
reduce their bilateral debt--would help African nations that are 
committed to undertake difficult economic reforms to build better lives 
for their people.
    We have an historic opportunity to support the renaissance in 
Africa. I want to commend Speaker Gingrich,<Gingrich, Newt<ls-thn-eq>
