Statement on the Death of Representative Sonny Bono<Bono, 
Sonny<ls-thn-eq>
January 6, 1998

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn this morning of the 
death of Representative Sonny Bono. His joyful entertainment of millions 
earned him celebrity, but in Washington he earned respect by being a 
witty and wise participant in policymaking processes that often seem 
ponderous to the American people. He made us laugh even as he brought 
his own astute perspective to the work of Congress. Hillary and I 
express our condolences to Representative Bono's wife<Bono, 
Mary<ls-thn-eq> and children and to his constituents and all Americans 
who appreciated his humor, his voice, and his devoted service to his 
community and Nation.
