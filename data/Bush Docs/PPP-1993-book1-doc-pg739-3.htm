Nomination for an Under Secretary of Commerce
May 25, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate Dr. Mary 
Lowe Good, the senior vice president of Allied-Signal, Inc., to be Under 
Secretary of Commerce for Technology Administration.
    ``One of the central challenges that we face in the 1990's is making 
sure that our Nation's technological capacities are developed as fully 
as possible,'' said the President. ``With a distinguished record of 
commercial research and of involvement with national technology policy, 
Dr. Good has what it takes to help ensure that Government does its part 
to make that happen.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
