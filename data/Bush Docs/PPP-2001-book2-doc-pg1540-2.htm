and the United Mexican States on Argentina

    Argentina is our neighbor and friend and we have witnessed recent 
events with concern and compassion. We hope that all Argentines can come 
together to find a solution that leads the country back to sustainable 
growth and prosperity. We applaud the great strength displayed by 
Argentina's institutions through this period, and reiterate our 
confidence in the country's standing as one of the Western Hemisphere's 
leading democracies.
