Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the
National Science Foundation
March 21, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 3(f) of the National Science Foundation 
Act of 1950, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1862(f)), I am pleased to transmit to 
you the Annual Report of the National Science Foundation for Fiscal Year 
1993.
    The Foundation supports research and education in every State of the 
Union. Its programs provide an international science and technology link 
to sustain cooperation and advance this Nation's leadership role.
    This report shows how the Foundation puts science and technology to 
work for a sustainable future--for our economic, environmental, and 
national security.

                                                      William J. Clinton
