Statement on the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act
July 27, 2000

    It is long past time that we correct several injustices in the 
immigration system by changing the registry date and amending the 
Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). People 
who have been living for many years in the United States and have 
developed strong ties to their communities deserve the opportunity to 
normalize their immigration status. There is no reason for Congress to 
stand in the way of a reasonable bipartisan bill to increase H-1B visas, 
invest in our workers, and correct these longstanding injustices. 
Congress should not pass H-1B or any other immigration legislation this 
year without ensuring that these injustices are addressed. The American 
people deserve no less.
