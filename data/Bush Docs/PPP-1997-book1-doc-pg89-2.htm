Message to the Senate Transmitting the Thailand-United States
Taxation Convention With Documentation
January 28, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand for the Avoidance of 
Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to 
Taxes on Income, signed at Bangkok, November 26, 1996. An enclosed 
exchange of notes, transmitted for the information of the Senate, 
provides clarification with respect to the application of the Convention 
in specified cases. Also transmitted is the report of the Department of 
State concerning the Convention.

[[Page 90]]

    This Convention, which is similar to other tax treaties between the 
United States and developing nations, provides maximum rates of tax to 
be applied to various types of income and protection from double 
taxation of income. The Convention also provides for the exchange of 
information to prevent fiscal evasion and sets forth standard rules to 
limit the benefits of the Convention to persons that are not engaged in 
treaty shopping.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

January 28, 1997.
