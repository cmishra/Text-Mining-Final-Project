Statement on the Anniversary of the United States Embassy Bombings in 
Kenya and Tanzania
August 6, 1999

    One year ago twin explosions at America's Embassies in Nairobi and 
Dar es Salaam claimed the lives of 12 dedicated Americans, 44 Kenyan and 
Tanzanian nationals working to support our diplomatic efforts, and more 
than 200 others going about their daily lives. Thousands more were 
injured, many seriously.
    The intended victims of this vicious crime stood for everything that 
is right about our country and the world: Americans and Africans working 
together for peace and progress and a better future. They were good 
people, taken from us precisely because they were doing good.
    Terrorists murdered these men and women and tore the hearts of those 
who loved them. But their violence could not and did not destroy the 
ideals for which their victims stood. Instead, we have only intensified 
our commitment to fundamental values: democracy and human rights, 
justice and tolerance.
    Their violence could not and did not damage America's bonds with 
Kenya, Tanzania, and the other striving nations of Africa. Instead, our 
Governments and peoples worked hand in hand to respond to the tragedy, 
and we remain united in our determination that terrorism will not 
destroy Africa's progress.
    Their violence could not and did not make America shrink from the 
world. Instead of giving in to those who wish us harm, we have stayed

engaged to promote freedom and opportunity, fight hunger and disease, 
build peace and stability, and thereby protect our national interests; 
and we have intensified the struggle against terrorist violence and 
strengthened security to protect our people. We have increased pressure 
on the Taliban and Afghanistan to deliver suspects in the Embassy 
bombings. Working with our friends abroad, we have tracked down, 
arrested, and indicted key suspects. And we will not rest until justice 
is done.
    The terrorists who bombed our Embassies could not and did not erase 
the lives of selflessness, courage, and joy that these 12 proud 
Americans lived. Today their names are inscribed at the State 
Department, so that all who pass through its halls will be reminded of 
them and their good deeds: Sergeant Jesse Nathan Aliganga;<Aliganga,

    We remember their contributions, their sacrifice, and the happiness 
they brought to those who knew them, and we will remember our obligation 
to all the men and women who serve our country overseas and to their 
families, to help them do their jobs and live their lives in the face of 
peril and to reward their service and faith in America with our 
gratitude and support.
    The struggle against violent hate and for a peaceful and tolerant 
world is far from over. But in the end, we will prevail against 
terrorism, because the spirited dedication of men and women like those 
who perished last August 7th lives on among people of good will all over 
the world. No bullet or bomb can ever destroy it.
