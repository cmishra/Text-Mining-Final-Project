Statement on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Decision on 
Planning for the Defense of Turkey
February 19, 2003

    I welcome today's decision by NATO's Defense Planning Committee to 
approve the deployment of AWACS aircraft, Patriot missiles, and 
biological and chemical defense equipment to Turkey. This is an 
important demonstration of the solidarity of NATO Allies in view of a 
potential threat to an Alliance member. It follows the decision taken on 
Sunday by the same committee to request military planning for such 
deployments.
    Today's decision is a direct response to the request by Turkey for 
consultations under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty as well as the 
commitment by all NATO Heads of State and Government, stated at Prague 
on November 21, 2002, ``to take effective action to assist and support 
the efforts of the U.N. to ensure the full and immediate compliance by 
Iraq, without conditions or restrictions, with UNSCR 1441.''
    I am grateful for the resolute leadership of NATO Secretary General 
Lord Robertson<Lord Robertson in bringing the Alliance 
discussions to a successful conclusion. I also appreciate the efforts of 
all the members of the Defense Planning Committee to fulfill their 
responsibilities as Alliance members in exceptionally difficult 
circumstances.
