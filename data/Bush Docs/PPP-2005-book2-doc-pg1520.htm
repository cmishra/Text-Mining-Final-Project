Remarks to Reporters Following a Visit With Wounded Troops at Walter 
Reed Army Medical Center
October 5, 2005

    Once again, I had the honor of thanking the docs and nurses that 
provide such incredible care to our wounded soldiers. Every time I come 
here, I'm amazed by the courage and decency and strength of those who 
wear the Nation's uniform. It is such an honor to be the Commander in 
Chief of such fine men and women.
    I ask for God's blessings on them and their families as they recover 
from their sacrifice and service.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 3:32 p.m. A tape was not available for 
verification of the content of these remarks.
