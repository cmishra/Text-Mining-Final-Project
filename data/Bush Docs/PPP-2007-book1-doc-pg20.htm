Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Request for Funding for the Department of Homeland Security
January 10, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed request for the 
Department of Homeland Security. The request is needed

[[Page 21]]

to liquidate prior-year obligations for contracts and grants made by the 
Transportation Security Administration. The request is fully offset by 
transferring unobligated balances and would not increase spending or the 
deficit.
    The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
January 11.
