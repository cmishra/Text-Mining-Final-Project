Remarks at the Sainte Mere Eglise Church in Sainte Mere Eglise, France
May 27, 2002

    President Chirac,<Chirac, Jacques> Mrs. Chirac,<Chirac, 
Bernadette> Mr. Mayor:<Lefevre, Marc> Laura and I 
are so honored to be here. Thank you for your hospitality. We are here 
to pay tribute to those who sacrificed for freedom, both Americans and 
the French. It is fitting that we remember those who sacrificed because 
today we defend our freedoms--we defend our freedoms against people who 
can't stand freedom.
    This defense will require the sacrifice of our forefathers, but it's 
a sacrifice I can promise you we'll make. It's a sacrifice we'll make 
for the good of America and for the good of France and for the good of 
freedom all over the world.
    It's an honor to be here. May God bless France, and may God bless 
America. Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 1:05 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
President Jacques Chirac of France and his wife, Bernadette; and Mayor 
Marc Lefevre of Sainte Mere Eglise.
