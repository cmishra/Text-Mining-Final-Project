Statement on the Legal Framework Agreement for the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
Oil Pipeline
April 28, 2000

    I am very pleased that today delegations from Azerbaijan, Georgia, 
and Turkey reached agreement on the legal framework for the Baku-
Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline. Last November in Istanbul, I witnessed the 
signing of initial documents for this framework. Today's achievement 
completes this work and brings the pipeline project a critical step 
closer to fruition.
    By this action, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey have shown once 
again their commitment to building regional cooperation, peaceful 
relations, and better lives for all their people. I congratulate 
Presidents Aliyev,<Aliyev, Heydar<ls-thn-eq> Shevardnadze,<Shevardnadze, 
Eduard<ls-thn-eq> and Demirel,<Demirel, Suleyman<ls-thn-eq> along with 
all the negotiating teams, for their leadership in moving this project 
forward.
    I look forward to the next phase of this effort, when companies from 
the United States, Western Europe, and Russia will work with those of 
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey to transform legal 
frameworks into commercial reality.
    The United States is committed to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline 
as a key part of our overall approach to Caspian energy development. We 
want to ensure access to world markets for the countries of the region, 
while helping diversify sources of energy supply for consumers in the 
United States and around the globe.

 Note: The statement referred to President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan; 
President Eduard Shevardnadze of the Republic of Georgia; and President 
Suleyman Demirel of Turkey.
