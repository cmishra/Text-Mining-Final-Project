Remarks Announcing the Resignation of Porter J. Goss<Goss, Porter 
J.<ls-thn-eq> as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency
May 5, 2006

    The President. This morning Director Porter Goss offered his 
resignation as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I've 
accepted it.
    During the course of his tenure, I've established a very close 
personal relationship with Porter, which is very important for the 
Director of the CIA. He's spent a lot of time here in the Oval Office. 
He's told me--he's given me his candid advice. I appreciate his 
integrity. I appreciate the honor in which--that he brought to the job.
    Porter's tenure at the CIA was one of transition. He's helped this 
Agency become integrated into the intelligence community, and that was a 
tough job. And he's led ably. He's got a 5-year plan to increase the 
number of analysts and operatives, which is going to help make this 
country a safer place and help us win the war on terror. He's instilled 
a sense of professionalism. He honors the proud history of

the CIA, an organization that is known for its secrecy in 
accountability. I am confident that his successor will continue the 
reforms that he's put in place, and as a result, this country will be 
more secure.
    We've got to win the war on terror, and the Central Intelligence 
Agency is a vital part of that war. And so I want to thank you for your 
service.

[At this point, Director Goss made brief remarks.]

    The President. God bless. Thank you. I appreciate you. Thank you 
very much.

Note: The President spoke at 1:44 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also 
included the remarks of Director Goss.
