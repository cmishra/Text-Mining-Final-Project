Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Report on the 
Intelligence Community Budget
April 9, 1996

Dear Mr. Chairman:
    In accordance with section 311(b) of the Intelligence Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1996, I transmit herewith the Report on Executive 
Branch Oversight of the Intelligence Community Budget. This report 
describes actions taken: (1) to improve budget formulation and execution 
for national intelligence agencies, (2) to establish more effective 
financial management throughout the intelligence community, with 
particular emphasis on the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and (3) 
to reduce the forward funding balances of the NRO.
        Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Larry Combest, chairman, House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Arlen Specter, chairman, 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
