Remarks on the Resignation of John R. Bolton<Bolton, John R.<ls-thn-eq> 
as United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations
December 4, 2006

    The President. I received the resignation of Ambassador John Bolton. 
I accepted; I'm not happy about it. I think he deserved to be confirmed. 
And the reason why I think he deserved to be confirmed is because I know 
he did a fabulous job for the country.
    And I want to thank you and Gretchen<Bolton, Gretchen<ls-thn-eq> for 
serving in a very important position, and doing so in a way that a lot 
of Americans really appreciate, John. We're going to miss you in this 
administration. You've been a stalwart defender of freedom and peace. 
You've been strong in your advocacy for human rights and human dignity. 
You've done everything that can be expected for an Ambassador.

    And I accept your letter, and I wish you and Gretchen<Bolton, 
Gretchen<ls-thn-eq> all the very best.
    Ambassador Bolton. Many thanks.
    The President. Thank you. Thanks for serving.

Note: The President spoke at 3:49 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Gretchen Bolton, wife of 
Ambassador Bolton. The Office of the Press Secretary also made available 
Ambassador Bolton's letter of resignation.
