Remarks on the Terrorist Attack in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia
June 25, 1996

    An explosion occurred this afternoon at the United States military 
housing complex near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
    Our best information at this time is that there are many injured. 
There have been fatalities. We do not yet know how many. The explosion 
appears to be the work of terrorists, and if that is the case, like all 
Americans, I am outraged by it.
    The cowards who committed this murderous act must not go unpunished. 
Within a few hours, an FBI team will be on its way to Saudi Arabia to 
assist in the investigation. Our condolences and our prayers go out to 
the victims' families and their friends. We're grateful for the 
professionalism shown by the Saudi authorities in their reaction to this 
emergency. We are ready to

work with them to make sure those responsible are brought to justice.
    Let me say again, we will pursue this. America takes care of our 
own. Those who did it must not go unpunished.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 6:22 p.m. in the Briefing Room at the White 
House. The related proclamation of June 26 honoring the victims of the 
bombing in Saudi Arabia is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
