December 16, 2003

    Debt reduction is critical if the Iraqi people are to have any 
chance to build a free and prosperous Iraq. Therefore, France, Germany, 
and the United States agree that there should be substantial debt 
reduction for Iraq in the Paris Club in 2004, and will work closely with 
each other and with other countries to achieve this objective. The exact 
percentage of debt reduction that would constitute ``substantial'' debt 
reduction is subject to future agreement between the parties.
