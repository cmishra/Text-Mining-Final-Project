Statement on Representative Deborah D. Pryce's<Pryce, Deborah 
D.<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not To Seek Reelection
August 16, 2007

    Throughout her congressional career, Deborah Pryce has championed 
issues that matter to the families of central Ohio. Her commitment to 
reducing taxes, strengthening our national defense, and reforming our 
health care system has helped improve the lives of her constituents and 
made America a more hopeful nation. She has also earned national 
recognition as a persuasive advocate on behalf of women and children.

colleagues selected her to lead the House Republican Conference--the 
highest leadership post ever held by a Republican woman. She will be 
missed when she departs the Congress.
    I look forward to continuing to work with her throughout the 
remainder of her service. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I appreciate 
Deb's friendship and wish her and her family all the best.
