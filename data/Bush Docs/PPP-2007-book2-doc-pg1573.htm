Message on the Observance of Eid al-Adha
December 19, 2007

    I send holiday greetings to all Muslims celebrating Eid al-Adha.
    During Eid al-Adha, Muslims around the world reflect on Abraham's 
unwavering faith and his trust in God when asked to sacrifice his son. 
These four days are a time for Muslims to honor Abraham's obedience by 
celebrating with family and friends and showing gratitude for the many 
blessings bestowed by God. This holiday also helps ensure the important 
values of compassion and devotion are passed on to future generations.
    America is a land of many beliefs, and our society is enriched by 
our Muslim citizens. The kindness, generosity, and goodwill displayed by 
American Muslims during this special occasion and throughout the year 
have contributed to the strength and vitality of our Nation. May all 
those observing Eid al-Adha find love and warmth during this joyous 
holiday.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a 
memorable celebration.

                                                          George W. Bush
