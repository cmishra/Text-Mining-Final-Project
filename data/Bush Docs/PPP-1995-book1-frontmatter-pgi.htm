                                Foreword

    The first half of 1995 was a time of challenge and change. The 
election of a new Republican Congress set the stage for a fundamental 
public debate over the role of government, the country's values, and the 
way we could move forward as one people. Throughout this debate, I 
remained firmly committed to this ideal: America is strong only when 
America is united, and when we leave no one behind.

    As I made clear in my State of the Union Address, we have an 
obligation to offer the American people a new kind of government for new 
times. My Administration recognizes that there isn't a program for every 
problem, but that we can produce a government that works better and 
costs less. We launched a top-to-bottom overhaul of Federal rules in an 
effort to bring common sense to often complex regulation. We streamlined 
the regulatory process by abolishing 16,000 pages of regulations. We 
reformed environmental workplace safety and pharmaceutical regulation 
and we trimmed red tape and business burdens, without hurting public 
safety and health. We eliminated the 10,000 page Federal personnel 
manual and we cut 136,000 positions from the Federal work force.

    As we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in 
Europe, we reaffirmed our commitment to lead for peace and freedom. At a 
summit meeting in Russia, I joined the Russian leader in advancing the 
security of our people and the world--by deepening our common efforts to 
reduce the nuclear threat, agreeing to improve our cooperation against 
terrorism, and pledging to work as partners for an undivided Europe. In 
Haiti, I thanked our troops for securing the transition from 
dictatorship to democracy. And at the 50th anniversary of the United 
Nations, we took stock of half a century of achievement and pledged to 
adapt the UN for the challenges of the 21st century.

    Pursuing our mission to create a safer world, the United States led 
the international effort among 170 countries to secure the indefinite 
and unconditional extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. And 
by applying steady, patient pressure to North Korea, we secured an 
agreement that froze its dangerous nuclear program.

    In furthering our commitment to open markets and expand 
opportunities for U.S. exports, we reached an historic agreement with 
Japan to open further its automotive market to potentially billions of 
dollars worth of American cars and parts.

    In April, our Nation was shaken by the tragic terrorist bombing of 
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. One hundred 
sixty-eight Americans lost their lives. But moments of tragedy often 
bring out the best in people, and thousands of Americans turned their 
energy and prayers toward helping the people of Oklahoma endure and 
overcome their enormous loss.

    Finally, in June, I introduced a balanced budget plan that reflected 
the values of the American people: opportunity, responsibility, the duty 
we owe one another, strong families, a strong America. This plan built 
on our success in reducing the deficit by nearly one half during the 
first two and one-half years of my Administration. This reflected an 
attempt to reach out to the Congress and find common ground on the 
budget. And it set the stage for a climactic debate: not about whether 
to balance the budget, but how.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period January 1-June 30, 1995. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    The Public Papers series also includes volumes covering the 
administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, 
Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush.
