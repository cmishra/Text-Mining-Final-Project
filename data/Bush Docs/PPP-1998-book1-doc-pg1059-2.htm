Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on the Line Item Veto
June 25, 1998

    I am deeply disappointed with today's Supreme Court decision 
striking down the line item veto. The decision is a defeat for all 
Americans--it deprives the President of a valuable tool for eliminating 
waste in the Federal budget and for enlivening the public debate over 
how to make the best use of public funds.
    By permitting the President to cancel discretionary spending, new 
entitlement authority, and certain types of tax provisions that benefit 
special interests at the expense of the public interest, the line item 
veto would enable Presidents to ensure that the Federal Government is 
spending public resources as wisely as possible. For 5\1/2\ years, I 
have worked hard to renew our economy by putting America's fiscal house 
in order. In 1993 the budget deficit was projected to be $290 billion; 
today, we have balanced the budget, and it is running a surplus. 
Continued fiscal responsibility is as vital now as the day I took 
office. I am determined to do everything in my power to continue to cut 
wasteful spending, maintain fiscal discipline, and create opportunity 
through continued economic growth.
