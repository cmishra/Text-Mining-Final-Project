    The President announced today that three career Foreign Service

    ``I am very pleased with the team that Secretary Christopher and I 
are assembling at the Department of State,'' said the President. ``I am 
particularly gratified that we have been able to put a number of people 
into senior positions who have devoted their careers to the Foreign 
Service.''
