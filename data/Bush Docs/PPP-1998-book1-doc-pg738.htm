Statement on the Middle East Peace Process
May 11, 1998

    I have just met with Secretary Albright,<Albright, Madeleine 
K.<ls-thn-eq> National Security Adviser Berger,<Berger, Samuel 
R.<ls-thn-eq> and Ambassador Ross.<Ross, Dennis B.<ls-thn-eq> 
Unfortunately, there will not be a meeting today with Prime Minister 
Netanyahu<Netanyahu, Binyamin<ls-thn-eq> and Chairman Arafat<Arafat, 
Yasser<ls-thn-eq> to launch the permanent status talks. I regret that.
    I have asked Secretary Albright<Albright, Madeleine K.<ls-thn-eq> to 
meet later this week with Prime Minister Netanyahu<Netanyahu, 
Binyamin<ls-thn-eq> while he is in Washington. The objective of those 
discussions will be to seek to overcome the remaining differences so 
that we can proceed immediately with accelerated permanent status talks.
    Secretary Albright<Albright, Madeleine K.<ls-thn-eq> will then 
report to me whether, as a result of her discussions with the Prime 
Minister,<Netanyahu, Binyamin<ls-thn-eq> the basis exists to launch 
those talks in Washington.
