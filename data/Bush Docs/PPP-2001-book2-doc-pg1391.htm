Statement on Signing the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2002
November 12, 2001

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2647, the ``Legislative Branch 
Appropriations Act, 2002.''
    The Act provides Fiscal Year 2002 appropriations for the Congress, 
the Congressional Budget Office, the Architect of the Capitol, the 
General Accounting Office, the Government Printing Office, and the 
Library of Congress.
    My Administration appreciates that the Congress has worked 
expeditiously during this difficult and trying time in our Nation's 
history to consider the Fiscal Year 2002 appropriations bills. Now, 
through a renewed sense of bipartisanship, the Congress and the 
Administration must work together to ensure the timely enactment of the 
remaining bills.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 November 12, 2001.

  Note:  H.R. 2647, approved November 12, was assigned Public Law No. 
107-68. This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on November 13.
