Statement on the Verdict in the Megan Kanka Trial
May 30, 1997

    This has been a terrible tragedy for the Kanka family and their 
community. Megan's family took their pain and helped guide the Nation to 
adopt legislation that is going to protect other children from those who 
would harm them. We owe the Kanka family not only our sympathy but a 
debt of gratitude as well.
