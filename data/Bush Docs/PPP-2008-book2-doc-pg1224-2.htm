Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> of Colombia
September 20, 2008

    Mr. President, members of your delegation, members of my Cabinet, 
Members of the United States Senate and United States Congress, honored 
guests: Welcome to the White House. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
are really pleased you all are here. Our nations share a faith in 
liberty, a willingness to defend it, and a confidence that freedom will 
define the future for our region. The American people, Mr. President, 
are proud to call the Colombian people our friends and our allies.
    You, Mr. President, are a strong leader. You and your Government and 
the Colombian people have shown courage in freedom's cause by taking on 
the terrorists and the drug lords. This summer, our Nation was impressed 
by the daring rescue of 15 hostages, 3<Gonsalves, Marc<ls-thn-eq> 
of<Howes, Thomas<ls-thn-eq> whom<Stansell, Keith<ls-thn-eq> were 
American citizens. We appreciate your leadership. We are pleased to be 
your partner in strengthening the rule of law and combating the illegal 
drug trade and helping victims of violence rebuild their lives and 
communities.
    We're also partners in the spread of prosperity. We have negotiated 
a fair free trade agreement that will benefit families and businesses in 
both our nations. And I appreciate your strong advocacy for this 
agreement. And my sincere hope is that the United States Congress will 
pass the Colombia free trade agreement as soon as possible.
    Mr. President, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I warmly remember 
our visits to your beautiful country. We were honored to visit a city 
liberated by the great Simon Bolivar. And in that visit we were honored 
to be with you and your lovely wife.<Moreno de Uribe, Lina 
Maria<ls-thn-eq>
    And so tonight I want to propose a toast to our friendship, the 
friendship between our countries. May God bless Colombia, and may God 
bless the United States.

Note: The President spoke at 7:31 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and 
Keith Stansell, former hostages held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia (FARC); and Lina Maria Moreno de Uribe, wife of President 
Uribe. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also
