Statement on the Resignation of Paul Begala<Begala, Paul> as 
Counselor to the President
February 24, 1999

    Paul Begala has been a close and trusted adviser since I first 
sought the Presidency. I value his advice; I appreciate his loyalty; and 
I treasure his friendship. I am grateful that he has used his razor-
sharp mind and wit in the service of core values and the common good. 
Paul has given long hours to the service of his country, and he has more 
than earned the right to seek new horizons, through teaching and 
writing, and to spend more time with his three young children. I expect 
he will continue to be a powerful and persuasive voice for the cause we 
share in years to come. Hillary and I wish him, Diane,<Begala, 
Diane> and the children all the best.
