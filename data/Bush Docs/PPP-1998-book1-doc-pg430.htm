Statement on the Attack at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas
March 24, 1998

    Like all Americans, Hillary and I are deeply shocked and heartbroken 
by this afternoon's horrifying events at Westside Middle School in 
Jonesboro, Arkansas.
    We don't know now and we may never fully understand what could have 
driven two<Golden, Andrew<ls-thn-eq> youths<Johnson, Mitchell<ls-thn-eq> 
to deliberately shoot into a crowd of their classmates.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and 
the entire Jonesboro community.

Note: In the statement, the President referred to Andrew Golden, 11, and 
Mitchell Johnson, 13, students at Westside Middle School, who fired on 
other students during a fire drill, killing four students and a teacher.
