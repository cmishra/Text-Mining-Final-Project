Statement on the Free Trade Agreements With Peru, Colombia, Panama, and 
South Korea
May 10, 2007

    I am pleased that my administration and congressional leaders have 
concluded a bipartisan agreement that provides a clear path for 
advancing our proposed free trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, 
Panama, and South Korea. Expanding opportunities for the sale of 
American goods and services is crucial to continued growth and job 
creation here in America. While these agreements will move forward 
independently, my administration is committed to working with Members of 
Congress and with the governments of our free trade agreement partners 
to secure the approval of each agreement. I also look forward to working 
with the Congress to extend trade promotion authority to negotiate 
agreements that open markets and generate new economic opportunities.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
