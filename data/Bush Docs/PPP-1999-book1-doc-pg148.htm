Statement on the Death of Paul Mellon<Mellon, Paul>
February 2, 1999

    Hillary and I are saddened by the death of Paul Mellon, one of 
America's most dedicated philanthropists. His generosity over a long 
lifetime invigorated and sustained our Nation's cultural and educational 
institutions. Carrying on his family's work, he donated a remarkable 
collection of priceless art to the National Gallery of Art, so that it 
could be enjoyed by future generations. He gave the Nation the Cape 
Hatteras National Seashore and led the restoration of Lafayette Park, 
across the street from the White House. He received the National Medal 
of the Arts and the National Medal for the Humanities, but his true 
recognition comes from the millions of people whose love of art his 
gifts inspired. His legacy of commitment to public service is, itself, 
priceless. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Bunny,<Mellon, 
Rachel Lambert Lloyd (Bunny)> his children, Catherine<Mellon 
Conover, Catherine> and Timothy,<Mellon, Timothy> 
and his grandchildren.
