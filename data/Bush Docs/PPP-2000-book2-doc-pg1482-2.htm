Memorandum on a Study of Compensation and Benefits for Filipino Veterans
July 27, 2000

Memorandum for the Secretary of the Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of 
State, the Secretary of Defense

Subject: Study of Compensation and Benefits for Filipino Veterans

    My Administration has recognized the unique contribution of Filipino 
veterans of the Second World War and worked to improve their 
compensation and benefits. In fact, for the last two sessions of 
Congress we have proposed legislation to eliminate the current dollar 
limitation for authorized compensation payments to Filipino 
beneficiaries residing in the United States. The proposed legislation 
has not been enacted. This reality, coupled with the fact that numerous 
Filipino veterans have immigrated to this country, suggests that the we 
need to raise awareness of the issues and options to help this group of 
deserving veterans.
    To that end, I am directing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to 
complete a study by October 31, 2000, of the needs of these veterans and 
the options available for addressing those needs. This study shall be 
conducted in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), the Department of State, and the Department of Defense, and would 
include a historical background of, and the issues associated with, the 
benefits afforded to Filipino veterans. It should also take into 
consideration changes in the Filipino veteran population and review 
options relative to the benefits afforded these veterans. It also would 
include the cost implications of options approved by OMB.

                                                      William J. Clinton
