Statement on Flooding and Mudslides in Venezuela
December 17, 1999

    I was deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life and physical 
devastation caused by flooding and mudslides in Venezuela. On behalf of 
the American people, I extend my deepest sympathies to all those who 
have suffered losses. We stand ready to help with rescue and relief 
efforts in any way we can.
