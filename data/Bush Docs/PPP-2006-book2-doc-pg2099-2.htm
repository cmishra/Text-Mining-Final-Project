Remarks at a State Banquet Hosted by President Nguyen Minh Triet<Triet, 
Nguyen Minh<ls-thn-eq> of Vietnam in Hanoi
November 17, 2006

    Mr. President and Madam Chi,<Chi, Tran Thi Kim<ls-thn-eq> the reason 
I'm smiling is because I'm really happy to be here, and so is 
Laura.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> And we thank you for your warm 
hospitality. First, I want to congratulate you for your success on 
hosting APEC. I'm confident our fellow leaders will have the same sense 
of gratitude and respect that we feel from the Vietnamese people.
     Vietnam is a remarkable country. For decades, you had been torn 
apart by war. Today, the Vietnamese people are at peace and seeing the 
benefits of reform. The Vietnamese own their own businesses, and today, 
the Vietnamese economy is the fastest growing in Southeast Asia. 
Vietnamese students have great opportunities here at home and abroad. 
The Vietnamese people are traveling around the world and sharing this 
ancient culture with peoples of the world. And the United States, as 
well as other APEC partners, look forward to strengthening our ties.
     The American people welcome the progress of Vietnam. And we want to 
continue to work together to better our relations. We will work with you 
to help combat avian flu and HIV/AIDS. We have signed agreements to 
protect religious freedom. We strongly support Vietnam in the World 
Trade Organization.
     Vietnam is a country that's taking its rightful place as a strong 
and vibrant nation. Mr. President, your leadership is helping your 
country succeed. I can see it as I drive on the streets; the people of 
your country have hope. And I hope they know, as a result of my visit, 
they have the friendship of the American people.
     And so, Mr. President, I would like to propose a toast to you and 
Madam Chi<Chi, Tran Thi Kim<ls-thn-eq> and to the fine people of 
Vietnam.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 7:15 p.m. at the 
International Convention Center. In his remarks, he referred to Tran Thi 
Kim Chi, wife of President Triet.
