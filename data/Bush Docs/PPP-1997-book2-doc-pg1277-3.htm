Statement on Signing the Military Construction Appropriations Act, 1998
September 30, 1997

    I have today signed into law H.R. 2016, the ``Military Construction 
Appropriations Act, 1998,'' which provides funding for military 
construction and family housing programs of the Department of Defense.

[[Page 1278]]

    The Act funds the vast majority of my request for military 
construction projects, the military family housing program, other 
quality-of-life projects for our military personnel and their families, 
and the base closure and realignment program.
    I am concerned, however, that the Congress has chosen to add funds 
for projects that the Department has not identified as priorities.
    I urge the Congress to complete action on the remaining FY 1998 
appropriations bills as quickly as possible, and to send them to me in 
an acceptable form.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

September 30, 1997.

Note: H.R. 2016, approved September 30, was assigned Public Law No. 105-
45.
