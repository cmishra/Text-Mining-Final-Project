Statement on Senate Action Confirming Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a Supreme 
Court Associate Justice
August 3, 1993

    I am extremely pleased at the swift and determined action by the 
U.S. Senate in overwhelmingly confirming Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the 
United States Supreme Court. I want to thank Chairman Biden, Senator 
Hatch, and their colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and the Senate as 
a whole for prompt consideration of her nomination.

    As President, I am proud of having nominated such an outstanding 
jurist who demonstrated in the confirmation process tremendous 
intellect, integrity, comprehension of the law, and compassion for the 
concerns of all Americans. I am confident that she will be an 
outstanding addition to the Court and will serve with distinction for 
many years.
