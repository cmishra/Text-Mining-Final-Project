Statement on the Death of Former White House Press Secretary Tony 
Snow<Snow, Tony<ls-thn-eq>
July 12, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of our dear friend Tony Snow. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife 
Jill<Snow, Jill<ls-thn-eq> and their children Kendall,<Snow, 
Kendall<ls-thn-eq> Robbie,<Snow, Robbie<ls-thn-eq> and Kristi.<Snow, 
Kristin<ls-thn-eq> The Snow family has lost a beloved husband and 
father, and America has lost a devoted public servant and a man of 
character.
    Tony was one of our Nation's finest writers and commentators. He 
earned a loyal following with incisive radio and television broadcasts. 
He was a gifted speechwriter who served in my father's<Bush, George 
H.W.<ls-thn-eq> administration. And I was thrilled when he agreed to 
return to the White House to serve as my Press Secretary. It was a joy 
to watch Tony at the podium each day. He brought wit, grace, and a great 
love of country to his work. His colleagues will cherish memories of his 
energetic personality and relentless good humor.
    All of us here at the White House will miss Tony, as will the 
millions of Americans he inspired with his brave struggle against 
cancer. One of the things that sustained Tony Snow was his faith. And 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I join people across our country in 
praying that this good man has now found comfort in the arms of his 
Creator.
