Statement on Signing Legislation To Reauthorize the Merit Systems 
Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel
October 29, 1994

    Today, I am signing into law H.R. 2970, a bill to reauthorize the 
Merit Systems Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel and 
provide additional protections for Federal employee whistleblowers and 
other victims of prohibited personnel practices.
    I have been advised that one provision in this bill (section 9), 
which concerns the apparent authority of an arbitrator to discipline a 
Federal employee who was not a party to the original action, raises 
serious constitutional questions. Accordingly, I am directing the 
agencies to follow appropriate procedures to protect the constitutional 
rights of such Federal employees and to consider the need for remedial 
legislation.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
October 29, 1994.

Note: H.R. 2970, approved October 29, was assigned Public Law No. 103-
424.
