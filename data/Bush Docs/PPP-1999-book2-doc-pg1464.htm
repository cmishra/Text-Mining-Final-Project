Statement on the Earthquake in Turkey
August 21, 1999

    On behalf of all Americans, Hillary and I offer our deepest 
condolences to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives in this 
week's devastating earthquake in Turkey. Our thoughts

and prayers are with all of those affected by this tragedy.
    Turkey is our long-time ally, and the people of Turkey are our 
friends. Now, with many of them in desperate need, we must do all we can 
to help. And we will. Working with the Turkish Government and other 
partners, we are already engaged in a broad-ranging assistance effort. 
Our civilian and military personnel are participating in search and 
rescue efforts; assessing emergency humanitarian needs; providing 
medical services; delivering medicines, blankets, and shelter materials; 
and helping to coordinate overall international aid.
    The task ahead is immense. Approximately one million people are 
sleeping outdoors; clean water is scarce; and the risk of disease is 
rapidly increasing. I know many Americans will want to help relieve the 
suffering and restore hope to the people. So I encourage my fellow 
citizens to give generously to responsible charitable organizations that 
are supporting relief efforts.
