Remarks Following a Tour of Tornado Damage in Lafayette
February 8, 2008

    The President. Phil<Spears, Phil<ls-thn-eq> and June Spears<Spears, 
June<ls-thn-eq> have just--I looked in their eyes and saw incredible 
sadness and worry.
    Phil Spears.<Spears, Phil<ls-thn-eq> It's true.
    The President. And I know the Governor<Bredesen, Philip N., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sharing our concerns with you. But I hope a 
couple of things become evident to you. One, there's a lot of people who 
care about you, total strangers showing up here in this community to 
help you get back on your feet.
    And the Government has got a role to play. And I want to thank 
the<Alexander, Lamar<ls-thn-eq> Senators<Corker, Robert<ls-thn-eq> 
and<Blackburn, Marsha<ls-thn-eq> Congressmen<Cooper, James Hayes 
Shofner<ls-thn-eq> for<Gordon, Barton Jennings<ls-thn-eq> being here, 
because

they know that there is programs available for you. And one of the 
things the people have got to do is call a phone number. If your life 
has been turned upside down here, if you've been affected, you ought to 
call 1-800-621-3362, 1-800-621-3362. And that's where you can find out 
the help that is available.
    What happened is, is that the Governor<Bredesen, Philip N., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and his team quickly moved as this storm moved through 
this--moved through the State of Tennessee, and he made an assessment, 
and he sent the paperwork up to me. And because he moved quickly, I was 
able to sign a disaster declaration that then frees help. And so we want 
the folks to know that there is help from the Federal Government, and he 
can get the number I just outlined. But there's also going to be a lot 
of help from loving neighbors.
    And we're sorry you're going through what you're going through. You 
know, life sometimes is unfair, and you don't get to play the hand that 
you wanted to play.
    Mr. Spears.<Spears, Phil<ls-thn-eq> That's true.
    The President. But the question is, when you get dealt the hand, how 
do you play it? And I've come away with this impression of the folks in 
Macon County: One, they're down-to-earth, good, hard-working people. 
They have a respect for the Almighty. And this community is going to be 
as strong as ever. That's what I think.
    Mr. Spears.<Spears, Phil<ls-thn-eq> Yes, sir.
    The President. I bet you feel the same way.
    Mr. Spears.<Spears, Phil<ls-thn-eq> Yes, sir. If it wasn't for my 
friends, I don't know what I'd do.
    The President. And you're going to find you got some new friends 
showing up too----
    Mr. Spears.<Spears, Phil<ls-thn-eq> Appreciate it.
    The President. ----people you've never heard of, they don't know who 
you are, total strangers. But when they know there's a neighbor in need, 
they'll come and help you.
    And I appreciate you giving me a chance to come by, and I know the 
folks traveling with me appreciate. We're so sorry you're going through 
what you're going through, but there's help, and that's what you've got 
to know.
    Anyway, God bless. Thank you.
    June Spears.<Spears, June<ls-thn-eq> Thank you.
    Mr. Spears.<Spears, Phil<ls-thn-eq> Appreciate it.
    The President. Yes. Hang in there, brother.<Spears, Phil<ls-thn-eq>

Note: The President spoke at 12:43 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Gov. Philip N. Bredesen, Jr., of Tennessee.
