Remarks on the Terrorist Attacks in Mumbai, India
November 29, 2008

    On behalf of all Americans, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
extend our condolences to those suffering from the terrorist attacks in 
Mumbai, India. We mourn those who lost their lives, including American 
citizens. We pray that the injured will recover. We pledge the full 
support of the United States as India investigates these attacks, brings 
the guilty to justice, and sustained its democratic way of life.
    My administration has been monitoring the situation in India closely 
since the attacks on Wednesday. On Thursday morning, I spoke to Prime 
Minister Singh<Singh, Manmohan<ls-thn-eq> from Camp David. I sent our 
heartfelt condolences to the Prime Minister. This morning I held a video 
conference with Secretary Rice,<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> our 
Ambassador to India,<Mulford, David C.<ls-thn-eq> our consul 
general<Folmsbee, Paul A.<ls-thn-eq> in Mumbai, and other national 
security officials. We reviewed the latest developments, and we are 
working to ensure that American citizens in India are safe. Throughout 
the process, we have kept President-elect Obama<Obama, Barack<ls-thn-eq> 
informed.
    The killers who struck this week are brutal and violent, but terror 
will not have the final word. The people of India are resilient; the 
people of India are strong. They have built a vibrant, multiethnic 
democracy that can withstand this trial. Their financial capital of 
Mumbai will continue to be the center of commerce and prosperity.
    The leaders of India can know that nations around the world support 
them in the face of this assault on human dignity. And as the people of 
the world's largest democracy recover from these attacks, they can count 
on the world's oldest democracy to stand by their side.
