Statement on Congressional Action on Education Reform Legislation
December 18, 2001

    I commend Members of Congress for acting boldly and in an 
overwhelmingly bipartisan way to help make sure no child in America is 
left behind. These historic reforms will improve our public schools by 
creating an environment where every child can learn through real 
accountability, unprecedented flexibility for States and school 
districts, greater local control, more options for parents, and more 
funding for what works.
    Many share in the credit for making these reforms a reality. I look 
forward to standing side by side with the bipartisan leadership, 
Congressman Boehner,<Boehner, John A.> Senator 
Kennedy,<Kennedy, Edward M.> Senator Gregg,<Gregg, 
Judd> and Congressman Miller,<Miller, George> early 
next year and signing these important reforms into law.
    By putting aside partisan differences and working to find common 
ground, we can get things done so that all our children have the 
opportunity for a better and brighter future.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
