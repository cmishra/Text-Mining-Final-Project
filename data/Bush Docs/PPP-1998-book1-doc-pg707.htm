Statement on Proposed Tobacco Legislation
May 6, 1998

    I commend Representatives Hansen<Hansen, James V.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Meehan<Meehan, Martin T.<ls-thn-eq> for their hard work in putting 
together a strong bipartisan comprehensive tobacco bill designed to 
reduce youth smoking in this country. The Hansen-Meehan bill contains a 
substantial price increase, strong industry and company penalties for 
failure to reduce youth smoking, full FDA authority to regulate tobacco, 
strong restrictions on advertising and youth marketing of tobacco 
products, and strong protections against exposure to environmental 
tobacco smoke. I look forward to working with them

to ensure that their legislation adequately protects tobacco farmers and 
to pass a comprehensive tobacco bill this year.
