Remarks Following a Cabinet Meeting
February 4, 2008

    Thank you all for coming. I just met with my Cabinet, where we 
discussed a lot of issues. And one issue we discussed was the budget. I 
submitted the budget today to Congress. It's on a laptop notebook, an e-
budget. It saves paper, saves trees, saves money. I think it's the first 
budget submitted electronically.

    And it's a good budget. It's a budget that achieves some important 
objectives. One, it understands our top priority is to defend our 
country, so we fund our military, as well as fund the homeland security.
    Secondly, the budget keeps our economy growing. It's central that we 
make sure that we deal with the uncertainties--the economic 
uncertainties we face. And that's why we're working hard with the House 
and the Senate to get a growth package out quickly that will put money 
in the hands of consumers and provide incentives to small businesses and 
large businesses to invest.
    Thirdly, we recognize that in order for this economy to grow, it's 
important to make the tax relief permanent. And that's what this budget 
reflects. It's a budget that boosts money for education and health and 
housing. It helps deal with the issue of making the Tax Code more fair 
for individuals who want to buy health insurance in the individual 
market.
    This budget is one that keeps spending under control; discretionary 
spending is held to less than 1 percent. It eliminates 151 wasteful or 
bloated programs, saving the taxpayers $18 billion. It also takes a hard 
look at entitlement growth over the next 5 years and provides specific 
recommendations to save $208 billion over those 5 years. At the same 
time, the budget achieves balance by 2012.
    This is a good, solid budget. It's not only an innovative budget, in 
that it's coming to Congress over the Internet, it's a budget that's 
balanced--it gets to balance in 2012 and saves taxpayers money.
    You know, in my State of the Union, I said to the Congress that 
there's a lot of talk about entitlement spending. Once again, we've 
proposed specific reforms and specific measures. And Congress needs to 
come up with its own ideas. And Congress needs to respond to these 
looming deficits as a result of unfunded liabilities inherent in Social 
Security and Medicare. Our budget does that. Our budget protects America 
and encourages economic growth. Congress needs to pass it.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 10:57 a.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
