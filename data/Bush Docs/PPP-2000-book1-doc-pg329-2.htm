Statement on Floods in Southern Africa
February 28, 2000

    I am deeply saddened by the devastation caused by flooding in 
southern Africa, which has worsened over the past few days. Almost a 
million people in Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zimbabwe have 
lost their homes or their livelihoods, and tens of thousands of people 
in Mozambique are stranded in flooded areas and require urgent rescue.
    Today we are allocating $1 million, through the U.S. Agency for 
International Development, to support aircraft for critical search and 
rescue operations and the delivery of relief supplies. In addition, we 
have already provided over $1.8 million to fund air transport, prevent 
disease, deliver supplies, and support relief efforts. Two aircraft from 
the Department of Defense are on the way to deliver shelter materials, 
blankets, and other relief supplies. Also, we are dispatching a disaster 
assistance response team to the region to determine other ways that we 
can help our friends in southern Africa.
    The thoughts and prayers of the American people are with the people 
of the region as they cope with this disaster.
