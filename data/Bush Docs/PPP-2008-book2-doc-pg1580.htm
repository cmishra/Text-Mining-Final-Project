Statement on Death of Andrew Wyeth<Wyeth, Andrew N.<ls-thn-eq>
January 16, 2009

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I deeply mourn the death of 
American painter Andrew Wyeth.
    Mr. Wyeth captured America in his paintings of his native 
Pennsylvania and Maine.
    Mr. Wyeth was no stranger to White House recognitions. He received 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963. President Nixon sponsored an 
exhibition of Andrew Wyeth's paintings at the White House. In 1990, my 
father<Bush, George H.W.<ls-thn-eq> presented Mr. Wyeth the 
Congressional Gold Medal. And in 2007, I awarded Mr. Wyeth the National 
Medal of Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and 
contribution to American arts and culture.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are fortunate to have known 
Andrew Wyeth and to have had the pleasure of enjoying his work. In 2005, 
Andrew and his wife Betsy<Wyeth, Betsy<ls-thn-eq> presented to the White 
House his painting, ``Jupiter,'' which is displayed in the Family 
Sitting Room in the Residence.
    On behalf of the American people, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
offer our sincere condolences to Betsy<Wyeth, Betsy<ls-thn-eq> and the 
Wyeth family. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.
