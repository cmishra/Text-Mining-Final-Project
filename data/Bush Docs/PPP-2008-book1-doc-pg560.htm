Remarks on Arrival in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
April 22, 2008

    The President. First of all, it's good to be back in Baton Rouge, 
home of the LSU Tiger national championship football team. I had the 
honor of welcoming the team and Coach Les Miles<Miles, Les<ls-thn-eq> to 
the White House, and it was a great honor for me, and I enjoyed it. And 
I do want to congratulate the good folks of Louisiana for supporting a 
football team that brought great credit to the game.

    I'm here with the<Jindal, Piyush ``Bobby''<ls-thn-eq> Governor--the 
great Governor of Louisiana to lend my support to John Kennedy<Kennedy, 
John Neely<ls-thn-eq> for the United States Senate. I thank 
Becky<Kennedy, Becky<ls-thn-eq> and Preston<Kennedy, Preston<ls-thn-eq> 
for joining us as well. John Kennedy will make a fine Senator for the 
people of Louisiana. He's a fiscal watchdog. He cares about the 
taxpayers' money. He's made a career out of making sure that whenever 
government spends money, it's spent wisely, and that's the kind of 
Senator Louisiana needs.
    He'll<Kennedy, John Neely<ls-thn-eq> support the troops. He'll 
support those who wear our Nation's uniform. And he'll see our troops 
are funded without the United States Senate telling our military how to 
conduct the war. So I appreciate your strong support for our military, 
John.
    You know, one of the issues that the Senate will be faced [with] * 
is whether or not to raise people's taxes. John Kennedy<Kennedy, John 
Neely<ls-thn-eq> has pledged to keep taxes low. We want the people here 
in Louisiana to have more of their own money to spend. And we can meet 
our priorities at the Federal Government without getting into the 
pockets of the people of Louisiana.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * White House correction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    And finally, John Kennedy<Kennedy, John Neely<ls-thn-eq> understands 
that our most important task is to protect the American people from 
harm. And if Al Qaida is making a phone call into the United States, he 
understands we need to know who they're talking to and why they're 
making the call.
    So I look forward to having a man in the Senate who understands the 
priorities have got to be to protect the American people and understands 
that the same civil liberties given to our people shouldn't be extended 
to terrorists who want to do us harm.
    So I wish you all the best, Senator-to-be.<Kennedy, John 
Neely<ls-thn-eq> We got a good fundraiser for you. I'm honored that you 
would invite me here. And I look--ask the people of Louisiana to give 
this good man a fair hearing--more importantly, give him their vote, 
because he'll do a fine job as the United States Senator.
    Thank you and congratulations.
    John N. Kennedy.<Kennedy, John Neely<ls-thn-eq> Thank you, Mr. 
President. Thank you so much.
    The President. Good to see you. Let's load up and get going.

Note: The President spoke at 3:19 p.m. at Baton Rouge Metropolitan 
Airport. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. Piyush ``Bobby'' Jindal of 
Louisiana; and Becky, wife, and Preston, son, of senatorial candidate 
John N. Kennedy.
