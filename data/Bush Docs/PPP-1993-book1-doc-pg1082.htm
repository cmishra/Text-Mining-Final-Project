Letter to the Speaker of the House on Flood Disaster Assistance
July 14, 1993

Sir:
    I ask Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed requests for 
emergency FY 1993 supplemental appropriations. These requests provide 
for emergency expenses arising from the consequences of the recent heavy 
rains and flooding along the Mississippi River, particularly in the 
Upper Midwest. I ask further that the legislation in which these funds 
are provided be kept free of extraneous matters in order that there may 
be a minimum of delay in providing necessary funds to the disaster 
areas.
    I hereby designate the following requests as emergency requirements 
pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
1985, as amended:
  <bullet>  Department of Agriculture, Commodity Credit Corporation, 
            Commodity Credit Corporation fund: $600,000,000;
  <bullet>  Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and 
            Conservation Service, Emergency conservation program: 
            $20,000,000;
  <bullet>  Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 
            Watershed and flood prevention operations: $25,000,000;
  <bullet>  Department of Defense--Civil, Corps of Engineers, Flood 
            control and coastal emergencies: $45,000,000;
  <bullet>  Department of Housing and Urban Development, Community 
            Planning and Development, Community development grants: 
            $3,000,000;

            Administration, Federal-aid highways: $100,000,000;

            Operating expenses: $5,000,000;
  <bullet>  Small Business Administration, Disaster loan program 
            account: $70,000,000; and
  <bullet>  Federal Emergency Management Agency, Disaster relief: 
            $550,000,000.
    The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
the Director's comments and observations.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton
