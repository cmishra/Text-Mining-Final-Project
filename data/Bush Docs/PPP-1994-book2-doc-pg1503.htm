Statement on the Observance of International Literacy Day
August 24, 1994

    On International Literacy Day, I am delighted to salute the many men 
and women who work so diligently to empower all people with the 
invaluable ability to read.
    If our world is to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century, 
we must harness the energy and creativity of all our citizens. Nearly 
half of American adults lack many of the basic literacy skills so 
essential to success in today's complex and ever-changing world. 
Literacy is not a luxury; it is a right and a responsibility. And in an 
international community increasingly dedicated to the principles of 
equality and opportunity, illiteracy is unacceptable.
    It takes great courage and hard work to overcome illiteracy. But 
with the help of dedicated teachers, tutors, and volunteers, everyone 
can learn the joys of reading and writing. These caring partnerships are 
the essence of community service, bringing hope and inspiration to all 
of us.
    As people around the world celebrate International Literacy Day, I 
stand with you in working toward the goal of universal literacy. I am 
proud to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the countless individuals 
whose tireless efforts are helping to put this dream within our grasp.

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: International Literacy Day was observed on September 8, 1994. An
