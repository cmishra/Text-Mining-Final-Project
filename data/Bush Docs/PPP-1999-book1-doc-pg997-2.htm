Concerning Loan Applicants

mortgages. This action is an important step to expand access to capital 
for all Americans. Allowing creditors to collect data for business and 
consumer loans will create greater innovation and increased access to 
credit, a higher level of voluntary compliance, and more effective fair

today's historic action by the Federal Reserve Board will ensure that 
more Americans have access to capital. The record has shown that the 
administration's community empowerment strategy is working in helping to 
revitalize our distressed inner-city neighborhoods and rural communities 
by spurring more private investment, igniting the spark of 
entrepreneurship, and providing opportunity for more Americans.
