Statement on House of Representatives Action on Estate Tax Legislation
June 18, 2003

    I commend the House of Representatives for acting to permanently 
eliminate the death tax. The death tax results in unfair double taxation 
of income and it hurts America's small businesses, which are the engine 
of job creation. Today's vote is a victory for fairness, job creation, 
and certainty for family businesses, farmers, and ranchers.
    Permanently eliminating the death tax is an important step toward 
increasing fairness in the Tax Code and promoting economic security. I 
urge the Senate to act on this important matter so that we can eliminate 
this unfair tax once and for all.
