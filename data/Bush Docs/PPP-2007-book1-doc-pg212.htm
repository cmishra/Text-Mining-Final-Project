Statement on the Death of Mario Chanes de Armas<Chanes de Armas, 
Mario<ls-thn-eq>
March 1, 2007

    Cuban patriot Mario Chanes de Armas was a political prisoner of the 
Castro regime for 30 years, one of the longest sentences of any 
political prisoner in the world. Like so many Cubans, he sought a 
democratic Cuban society only to see his quest betrayed by a Castro 
dictatorship. Mario Chanes was one of the original plantados, Cuban 
political prisoners who were unyielding in their fervent desire for a 
free Cuba. His patriotism and strong sense of purpose are examples to 
all freedom-loving people. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in 
sending our thoughts and prayers to his family and friends.

Note: The statement referred to President Fidel Castro Ruz of Cuba.
