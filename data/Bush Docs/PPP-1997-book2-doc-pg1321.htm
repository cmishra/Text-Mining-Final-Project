Statement on House Ways and Means Committee Action on Fast-Track Trading 
Authority Legislation
October 8, 1997

    I am pleased that the House Ways and Means Committee has reported 
out legislation with bipartisan support that restores the traditional 
trading authority every President has had since 1974.
    To keep our economy strong, we must continue to break down unfair 
foreign trade barriers to American products and services. This 
legislation, now passed by the committees of jurisdiction in both the 
Senate and the House, will allow us to tear down those barriers and help 
American businesses and workers compete and win in the global 
marketplace. I look forward to working with Members on both sides of the 
aisle to secure passage of this important legislation this year.
