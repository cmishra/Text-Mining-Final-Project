Remarks at the Boys & Girls Club of South Central Kansas--21st Street 
Club in Wichita
June 15, 2007

    The President. I have come to this fantastic facility to, first of 
all, thank the people that have supported the programs that exist here. 
I like the idea of mentors reaching out to children to set good examples 
and to encourage them to achieve big goals in life. And that's what 
happens here in this Boys and Girls Club in Wichita. This is a place 
where dreams are fostered and skills are given so that people can 
realize their dreams.
    This is a community-based program. It gets some help from the 
government, but it gets a lot of help from the local community. And I 
think it's very important for the people of Wichita to support program 
such as this. After all, we can change our country one heart and one 
soul at a time. So I'm really pleased to be here. It's a beautiful 
facility full of beautiful people.
    And so thank you for giving me a chance to come by and say hello. 
Yes, you won an award didn't you?
    Ciera <Ivy, Ciera<ls-thn-eq>Ivy. Yes.
    The President. What award did you win?
    Ms.<Ivy, Ciera<ls-thn-eq> Ivy. Youth of the Month.
    The President. Youth of the Month. That's good. Congratulations to 
you.
    Ms.<Ivy, Ciera<ls-thn-eq> Ivy. Thank you.
    The President. I want to thank the counselors who are here and all 
the adults that are working with the boys and girls.
    Anyway, nice to see you all. Thanks for coming by. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. A portion of these remarks could
