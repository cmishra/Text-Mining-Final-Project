Remarks Prepared for Delivery to a Friends of Ireland Luncheon
March 15, 2001

    Thank you, Mr. Speaker.<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> Taoiseach, 
<Ahern, Bertie<ls-thn-eq>Secretary of State for Northern Ireland John 
Reid,<Reid, John<ls-thn-eq> First Minister David Trimble,<Trimble, 
David<ls-thn-eq> Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon,<Mallon, 
Seamus<ls-thn-eq> Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams,<Adams, 
Gerry<ls-thn-eq> Secretary Powell,<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> Majority 
Leader Lott,<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> other Members of Congress, thank 
you.
    I thank the Speaker<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> for the invitation 
to come here to celebrate the shared history and heritage that unite 
Ireland and

America. It is a great honor. And I promise that my remarks today will 
be briefer than the last time I spoke on Capitol Hill.
    Some of you may be aware that I don't attend a lot of formal lunches 
like this. But I had a change of heart when I saw that the 
Speaker's<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> menu included Tex-Mex food. I 
just couldn't pass up the chance to try a green burrito.
    On Saint Patrick's Day, we all get to be Irish for a day. There has 
been a lot of speculation about whether I'm part Irish. I must be. 
People say I talk like James Joyce writes.
    Today I will speak plainly about an extremely important topic, peace 
in Northern Ireland. The United States will remain unwavering in our 
support of peace. We will remain unwavering in our support for all 
parties who show courage and leadership on behalf of peace. And we will 
remain unalterably opposed to anyone who would destroy peace by 
preaching or practicing violence.
    Much of the progress toward peace in the past several years has been 
aided by the engagement of the United States. As I told Prime 
Minister<Blair, Tony<ls-thn-eq> Blair--and as I will tell Prime Minister 
Ahern<Ahern, Bertie<ls-thn-eq> tomorrow--the United States stands ready 
to continue that engagement. The reason is simple: Peace in Northern 
Ireland is in America's strong national interest.
    The peace that holds today has many authors, from President 
Clinton<Clinton, William J.<ls-thn-eq> to leaders from Britain, Ireland, 
and Northern Ireland to American political leaders, such as Senator 
Mitchell.<Mitchell, George J.<ls-thn-eq> The Good Friday agreement 
remains the best hope for lasting peace for the people of Northern 
Ireland. The goal of the United States is to see that agreement fully 
implemented.
    There are two reasons for this. First, this is what the people of 
Ireland and Northern Ireland voted for back on May 22, 1998. And they 
did so by a very large margin. Second, the Good Friday agreement 
embodies principles of fundamental fairness without which peace will 
never breathe.
    What are those principles? First, as stated in the agreement itself, 
``it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement 
between the two parts . . . to exercise their right to self-
determination on the basis of consent.'' The second principle is that of 
territorial integrity, that borders should never be changed through 
violence. Third, that terrorism is always and everywhere wrong. And 
fourth, there is the principle of equality of representation and equal 
treatment regardless of religion, race, or ethnicity.
    The progress the parties have made in putting these principles into 
practice has made a difference--a big difference. And no one knows this 
better than the people of Northern Ireland themselves. Trade, 
investment, and jobs are up. Violence is down from previous levels. More 
people are moving into Northern Ireland than are moving out. In most 
places on most days for most families, life is normal. They don't have 
to worry when they get on a bus, go to a store or church, or send a 
child to school. And no one can put a price on that peace of mind.
    But no one can or should take this progress for granted, no one on 
either side of the border, either side of the Irish Sea, or either side 
of the Atlantic. It may be tempting for the parties to think they face a 
choice between further progress and the status quo. But in fact, the 
actual choice is probably between progress and a return to violence, 
because extremists on both sides still seek to destroy the agreement. 
Delay and impasse create a vacuum that they will try to fill. We must 
not let them.
    The talks that Prime Ministers Blair<Blair, Tony<ls-thn-eq> and 
Ahern<Ahern, Bertie<ls-thn-eq> convened in Belfast last week created an 
opportunity to restore momentum toward resolving these issues and fully 
implementing the Good Friday agreement. Keeping the process moving 
forward will mean compromise, hard work, and trust. Trust is critical to 
resolving tough issues facing the parties: building a police force

that has the respect of all the people; putting arms finally and forever 
beyond use; achieving a normal security presence throughout the society; 
making sure the new political institutions are here to stay. Now is the 
time to act--as Yeats said, ``Do not wait to strike till the iron is 
hot, but make it hot by striking.''
    The parties in Northern Ireland, many of whose leaders are 
represented here today, have shown themselves capable of rising to the 
occasion and moving forward with wisdom and confidence. And as you do 
so, know that the United States will be ready to help in any way the 
governments and the parties find useful.
    It's been said that Ireland is a place where ``the inevitable never 
happens and the unexpected constantly occurs.'' Three years ago, the 
parties unexpectedly gave us the Good Friday agreement. Weeks later, 
citizens in all parts of the island defied all expectations by voting to 
approve the agreement in overwhelming numbers. This year on Saint 
Patrick's Day, let us all resolve to push for peace, a lasting, real, 
and needed peace.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President delivered the remarks at approximately noon in the 
Rayburn Room at the U.S. Capitol. The prepared text referred to First 
Minister David Trimble and Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon, Northern 
Ireland Executive; Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom; 
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland; and former Senator George J. 
Mitchell, who chaired the multiparty talks in Northern Ireland. This 
text was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on March 23. The
