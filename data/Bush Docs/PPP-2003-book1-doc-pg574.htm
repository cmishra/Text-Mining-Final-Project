Remarks to Journalists in Auschwitz, Poland
May 31, 2003

    Laura and I have just toured Auschwitz I, and what they call 
Auschwitz II, a place where millions were murdered. The sites are a 
sobering reminder that--of the power of evil and the need for people to 
resist evil. This site is a sobering reminder that when we find anti-
Semitism, whether it be in Europe or anywhere else, mankind must come 
together to fight such dark impulses.
    And this site is also a strong reminder that the civilized world 
must never forget what took place on this site.
    May God bless the victims and the families of the victims, and may 
we always remember.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 9:30 a.m. following a tour of 
World War II Nazi concentration camp sites. A tape was not available for 
verification of the content of these remarks.
