Nomination for the National Credit Union Administration
October 26, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate former New 
Hampshire Congressman Norman E. D'Amours to the Board of Directors of 
the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).
    ``The NCUA Board is charged with an important task, safeguarding the 
futures of the millions of hard-working Americans who put their savings 
in credit unions. I have faith in Norm D'Amours' ability to uphold that 
responsibility,'' said the President.

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
