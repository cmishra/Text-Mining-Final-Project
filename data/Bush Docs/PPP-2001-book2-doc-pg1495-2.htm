Message on the Observance of Hanukkah, 2001
December 7, 2001

    Laura and I send our warmest greetings to all those celebrating 
Hanukkah, the festival of lights.
    The celebration of Hanukkah is inspired by the story of the miracle 
of the lamp: how a ration of oil sufficient only for one day burned for 
eight. It is a holiday of hope that encourages trust in God's providence 
and God's purposes, even when we are threatened by darkness and 
destruction.
    Hanukkah commemorates the reconsecration of the ancient temple in 
Jerusalem by the Maccabees and their followers, after it had been 
desecrated. Hanukkah celebrates the liberation of the ancient kingdom of 
Israel from foreign occupation. It teaches us that freedom must 
sometimes be fought for--a message that continues to resonate today.
    We join all people of Jewish faith in thanking God who has 
``sustained us and enabled us to reach this season.'' May the candles of 
Hanukkah light our memories of those lost on September 11. And may this 
be a season of joy for us all.

                                                          George W. Bush
