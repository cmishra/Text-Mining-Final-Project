    The President announced today that he intends to nominate career 
Veterans Affairs official Raymond John Vogel, to be the Under Secretary

uniquely qualified to apply his indepth expertise to the VA's new 
commitment to serve America's veterans during a new era of efficiency 
and sensitivity. He will ably assist VA Secretary Jesse Brown in his 
plans to modernize and streamline the VA claims process.''
