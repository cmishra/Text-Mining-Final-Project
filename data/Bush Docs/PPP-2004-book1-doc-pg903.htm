Statement on Senate Passage of Legislation To Implement Project 
BioShield
May 19, 2004

    I commend the Senate for passing legislation that will bolster the 
Nation's defenses against biological, chemical, radiological, and 
nuclear threats. Project BioShield will speed the development of new 
vaccines and treatments that would help prevent harm to Americans in a 
terrorist attack. This legislation carries out my proposal to encourage 
accelerated research and development of medical countermeasures based on 
the latest scientific discoveries, provides for rapid stockpiling of 
critical new drugs and vaccines, and makes these treatments available 
quickly in emergency situations. America is more secure today because we 
have placed a strong emphasis on homeland defense, and initiatives like 
Project BioShield are another important step in winning the war on 
terror.
