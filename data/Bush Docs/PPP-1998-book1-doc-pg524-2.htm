Nation Trade Status for Vietnam
April 7, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Pursuant to subsection 402(c)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, 
(hereinafter the ``Act''), I have issued an Executive order waiving the 
application of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act with 
respect to Vietnam.
    I wish to report to the Congress that I have determined that the 
requirements of subsections 402(c)(2)(A) and (B) of the Act have been 
satisfied.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
