Remarks on the Terrorist Attacks in Russia
September 12, 2004

    Mr. Ambassador,<Ushakov, Yuriy Viktorovich<ls-thn-eq> thank you for 
receiving Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and me. I'm here to express my 
country's heartfelt sympathies for the victims and the families who 
suffered at the hands of the evil terrorists. The United States stands 
side by side with Russia as we fight off terrorism, as we stand shoulder 
to shoulder to make the world a more peaceful place and a free place.
    The atrocities that took place in the school were beyond 
comprehension. Many in America and, I know, many in Russia simply cannot 
conceive the hearts of a person that would mow down innocent children. 
And the killers, once again, reminded us--remind us of the duties we 
have as free people to work in concert, to work in unity, to make this 
world a better place.
    And so, Mr. Ambassador,<Ushakov, Yuriy Viktorovich<ls-thn-eq> I'm 
honored. Please pass on my very best wishes to President Vladimir 
Putin,<Putin, Vladimir<ls-thn-eq> a man who I admire. I talked with 
Vladimir right after the incident. We had a very good discussion about 
the need for us to continue to work together. I pledged our Government 
would continue to work with the Russian Government and the Russian 
people.
    And may God bless the people of Russia, and may God bless those who 
suffer. Thank you all very much.

Note: The President spoke at 12:49 p.m. at the Russian Embassy in 
Washington, DC. In his remarks, he referred to Yuriy Viktorovich 
Ushakov, Russia's Ambassador to the United States; and President 
Vladimir Putin of Russia. A tape was not available for verification of 
the content of these remarks.
