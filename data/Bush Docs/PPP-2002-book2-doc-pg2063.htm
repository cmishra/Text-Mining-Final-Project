Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction
November 6, 2002

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency posed by the proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems declared by 
Executive Order 12938 on November 14, 1994, as amended, is to continue 
in effect beyond November 14, 2002, to the Federal Register for 
publication. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was 
published in the Federal Register on November 13, 2001 (66 FR 56965).
    The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of 
delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined the national emergency previously declared 
must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2002.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 November 6, 2002.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
November 12. The notice of November 6 is listed in Appendix D at the end 
of this volume.
