Exchange With Reporters During Discussions With President
Kim Yong-sam of South Korea in Cheju
April 16, 1996

    Q. President Kim, are you excited about the opportunity for a 
breakthrough with the dialog between North and South Korea?
    President Kim. Yes. I think that there is a possibility.
    Q. And do you welcome the fact that China might participate as well?
    President Kim. Well, we'll have a chance to talk about it later at 
the press conference.
    Q. Mr. President, was it as pretty down on the beach as it looked 
from up above?
    President Clinton. Yes. I felt like a honeymooner again.

Note: The exchange began at 11:20 a.m. in the garden at the Shilla 
Hotel. President Kim spoke in Korean, and his remarks were translated by 
an interpreter. A tape was not available for verification of the content 
of this exchange.
