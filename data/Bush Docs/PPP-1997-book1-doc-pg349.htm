Statement on Campaign Finance Reform Legislation
March 25, 1997

    In my State of the Union Address, I challenged Congress to pass 
bipartisan campaign finance reform by July 4th, the date we celebrate 
the birth of our democracy. The only way that political reform will 
become law is if citizens raise their voices to demand change. I 
strongly support the bipartisan legislation introduced by Senators John 
McCain and Russ Feingold, and Representatives Chris Shays and Marty 
Meehan. It is real, it is fair, it is tough, and it will curb the role 
of big money in our politics.
    We know the pressing need for reform. The campaign finance laws are 
two decades out of date and have been overwhelmed by a flood of money 
that rises with every election. Above all, campaign finance reform will 
help us to meet our Nation's fundamental challenges. It will help us 
balance the budget, fight crime, extend health care to our children, 
protect our young people from the dangers of tobacco. Reform will help 
make sure that our political system stands for ordinary Americans and 
helps them in their daily lives.
    At Faneuil Hall, the ``Cradle of Liberty,'' and at Independence 
Hall, our Founders forged our democracy. Now it is up to all of us, in a 
new time, to renew that democracy and to make sure that our Government 
represents the national interest, not just narrow interests. I thank 
those who are fighting for reform and who are gathered at Faneuil Hall 
for their leadership and urge all citizens to join in this effort. This

year can be the year that we finally pass campaign finance reform.

Note: This statement was read at the Project Independence rally for 
campaign finance reform at Faneuil Hall in Boston, MA.
