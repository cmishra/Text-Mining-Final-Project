Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process
November 18, 1999

    The parties in Northern Ireland, working with George 
Mitchell,<Mitchell, George J.> have taken a powerful step 
toward lasting peace. I warmly welcome Senator Mitchell's final report 
and support his conclusions fully. We should all take heart from the 
fact that the parties have strongly reaffirmed their commitment to the 
Good Friday accord. In a spirit of unprecedented mutual understanding, 
they have addressed issues of deep concern to one another. Together, 
they have shaped the outlines of the way ahead, as described by Senator 
Mitchell today. I urge the parties to maintain this level of dialog with 
each other and with the public at large in the days ahead and to proceed 
with rapid implementation of the agreement. Once again, I want to 
express my deepest appreciation to Senator Mitchell for his dedication 
to bringing peace to Northern Ireland.
