Statement on Representative Vic Fazio's Decision Not To Seek Reelection
November 17, 1997

    Representative Vic Fazio has been a strong leader for the American 
people, a strong advocate for his district, and a good friend to me and 
my administration. He has served with an unswerving devotion to the 
national interest. He has been a champion for the environment, for our 
national defense, for fiscal discipline, and for ensuring that changes 
in our defense structure after the cold war take into consideration the 
interest of the communities, like his own Sacramento, that have 
supported our military. I especially appreciate the work he has done to 
make sure that America seizes the opportunities of trade and to make 
sure that the growing global economy benefits all Americans.
    Vic Fazio has also been a tireless leader of the Democratic Party in 
Congress, and a tireless advocate of our party's beliefs. On a personal 
note, I have greatly benefited from his warmth, his idealism, and his 
honesty. On behalf of the Nation, I thank him for his dedicated service.
