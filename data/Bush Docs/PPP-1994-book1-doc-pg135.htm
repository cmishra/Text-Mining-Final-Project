Nomination for Commandant of the United States Coast Guard
January 25, 1994

    The President announced his intention today to nominate Rear Admiral 
Robert E. Kramek, USCG, to be the 20th Commandant of the U.S. Coast 
Guard, Department of Transportation.
    ``Admiral Kramek has served his country proudly for 33 years and has 
distinguished himself through his performance in a number of challenging 
assignments,'' said the President. ``He has consistently demonstrated 
the strong leadership ability the Coast Guard needs to remain the vital 
service that it always has been. I am confident that he will perform up 
to the high standards set by his predecessor, Admiral Bill Kime.''

Press Secretary.
