September 24, 2003

    Hugh Gregg left an indelible mark on the State he loved and on the 
lives of the people of New Hampshire. He served his country in time of 
war and served his State with distinction as Governor, statesman, and 
successful business leader. In all of his endeavors, he acted with 
integrity and honor. He will be missed. Laura joins me in sending our 
condolences to his wife, Catherine,<Gregg, Catherine Warner<ls-thn-eq> 
his two<Gregg, Cyrus<ls-thn-eq> sons,<Gregg, Judd<ls-thn-eq> and his 
family during this difficult time.
