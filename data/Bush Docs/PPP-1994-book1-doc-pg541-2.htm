Statement on the Air Collision at Pope Air Force Base
March 23, 1994

    I am deeply saddened to learn of the tragic air collision at Pope 
Air Force Base in North Carolina and the resultant loss of life and 
injuries. Hillary and I join all Americans in expressing our condolences 
to the families and friends of those killed and wish a speedy recovery 
to those injured. This tragedy is a reminder that all those who serve in 
the military at home and abroad put their lives at risk in the service 
of their Nation and deserve the thanks of all Americans for doing so.
