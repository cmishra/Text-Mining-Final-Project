Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President
Kim Yong-sam of South Korea in Cheju
April 16, 1996

    Q. Good morning, sir.
    The President. Good morning. Did you get some sleep?
    Q. A little bit. Mr. President, do you think the start of these 
four-way talks could really bring peace to this peninsula? Are you 
encouraged that these four-way talks could lead to peace? What about the 
situation along the border between Israel and Lebanon; anything the 
United States can do to stop that fighting?
    The President. We're going to answer questions, you know, after our 
meeting; but we're working very hard on that and we've been at it for a 
couple of days now, and we're doing the best we can.

Note: The exchange began at 11:04 a.m. in the garden at the Shilla 
Hotel. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this 
exchange.
