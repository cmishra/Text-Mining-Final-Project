Remarks on the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty in Albuquerque
October 17, 1994

    I am delighted that Israel and Jordan have reached agreement on the 
text of their peace treaty. Earlier today, I spoke with King Hussein and 
Prime Minister Rabin. I congratulated them on their historic achievement 
and on their courage and persistence in getting there. I assured them 
that the United States will continue to stand with them in the days 
ahead and to support this peace process as we have all along.
    These leaders have decided that from now on they will live in peace 
as neighbors. They have decided that they want to be friends. And their 
friendship and their peace is clearly welcomed by the friends of peace 
throughout the world. At a time when hatred and extremism and 
threatening behavior still stalk the Middle East, this is a clear signal 
that there can be a different future. This agreement reminds us that 
moderation and reason can and will prevail in the Middle East, that 
nations can put conflict behind them, that statesmen can lead people to 
peace.
    On behalf of the American people, I want to say a profound word of 
thanks and congratulations to both King Hussein and Prime Minister 
Rabin, and especially to the people of Israel and the people of Jordan.

Note: The President spoke at 12:42 p.m. at the Albuquerque Convention 
Center.
