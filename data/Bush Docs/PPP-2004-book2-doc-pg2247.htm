Statement on House of Representatives Action on a Constitutional 
Amendment on Marriage
September 30, 2004

    Today a bipartisan majority of U.S. Representatives voted in favor 
of a constitutional amendment affirming the sanctity of marriage as a 
union between a man and a woman. I am disappointed that the House failed 
to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote. Because activist judges and 
local officials in some parts of the country are seeking to redefine 
marriage for the rest of the country, we must remain vigilant in 
defending traditional marriage. I welcome the important debate underway 
across America on this issue.
