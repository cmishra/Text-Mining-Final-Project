Statement on Support for Russian Reform
May 31, 1998

    On Friday, I welcomed Russia's new economic program for 1998 and 
encouraged strong IMF and World Bank engagement in support of reform. 
Implementation of this program will strengthen the fundamentals of the 
Russian economy and foster maintenance of a stable ruble. Following my 
conversation with President Yeltsin<Yeltsin, Boris<ls-thn-eq> last week, 
we directed our officials to consult on the Russian economic and 
financial situation. The United States endorses additional conditional 
financial support from the international financial institutions, as 
necessary, to promote stability, structural reforms, and growth in 
Russia.
