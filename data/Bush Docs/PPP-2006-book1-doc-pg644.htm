Remarks on Immigration Reform Legislation
April 5, 2006

    The United States Senate is debating a very vital issue for our 
country, and that is immigration reform. I urge the Senators to continue 
to work toward get a comprehensive bill; a bill that will help us secure 
our borders; a bill that will cause the people in the interior of this 
country to recognize and enforce the law; and a bill that will include a 
guest-worker provision that will enable us to more secure the border, 
will recognize that there are people here working hard for jobs 
Americans won't do, and a guest-worker provision that is not amnesty, 
one that provides for automatic citizenship.
    This is a vital debate. I thank the Members who are working hard to 
get a bill done. I strongly urge them to come to conclusion as quickly 
as possible and pass a comprehensive bill.
    Thank you all very much.

Note: The President spoke at 8:55 a.m. on the Colonnade at the White 
House.
