Statement on Assistance to Israel
June 19, 2007

During our meeting today, I told Prime Minister Olmert<Olmert, 
Ehud<ls-thn-eq> that I am committed to reaching a new 10-year agreement 
that will give Israel the increased assistance it requires to meet the 
new threats and challenges it faces. The work on this new agreement was

Secretary of State Nick Burns<Burns, R. Nicholas<ls-thn-eq> and an 
interagency team to Israel in July to
