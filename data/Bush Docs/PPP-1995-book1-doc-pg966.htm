Message to the Senate Transmitting Documents on the
Ukraine-United States Taxation Convention
June 28, 1995

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith an exchange of notes dated at Washington May 26 
and June 6, 1995, for Senate advice and consent to ratification in 
connection with the Senate's consideration of the Convention Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ukraine 
for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal 
Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, together with a 
related Protocol, signed at Washington on March 4, 1994 (``the Taxation 
Convention''). Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the exchange of notes.
    This exchange of notes addresses the interaction between the 
Taxation Convention and other treaties that have tax provisions, 
including in particular the General Agreement on Trade in Services 
(GATS), annexed to the Agreement Establishing the World Trade 
Organization, done at Marrakesh April 15, 1994.
    I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to this 
exchange of notes and give its advice and consent to ratification in 
connection with the Taxation Convention.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

June 28, 1995.
