Statement on the Nomination of Dennis J. Reimer To Be Chief of Staff of 
the United States Army
April 7, 1995

    I am pleased to announce my intention to nominate General Dennis J. 
Reimer, U.S. Army, as Chief of Staff, United States Army, succeeding 
General Gordon R. Sullivan, who is retiring.
    General Reimer currently serves as the Commanding General, U.S. Army 
Forces Command. In this capacity, he is responsible for over 60 percent 
of America's Army including Active, Reserve and National Guard units. 
During his distinguished career, General Reimer served two tours in 
Vietnam, was the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations during 
Desert Storm, and played a key role in the transformation of the cold-
war Army to today's power projection Army. He brings to the job of Chief 
of Staff a clear vision of the national security environment the United 
States will face through the remainder of this decade and into the next 
century. This insight will enable him to address the full range of 
challenges confronting the U.S. Army, including readiness challenges, 
the impact of emerging technology, expanded mission requirements, and 
improving the quality of life for our soldiers and their families.

    General Reimer takes over as Chief of Staff during one of the most 
important and demanding periods in the rich history of the U.S. Army. I 
know that I can count on him to continue the outstanding leadership 
demonstrated by General Sullivan and to maintain his high standards of 
stewardship to ensure that the U.S. Army remains fully ready and able to 
accomplish its important responsibilities under our national security 
strategy.
