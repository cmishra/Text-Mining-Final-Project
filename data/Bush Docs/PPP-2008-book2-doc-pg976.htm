Remarks on Departure From the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda
July 3, 2008

Rescue of Hostages in Colombia

    Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak to President Uribe<Uribe 
Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> of Colombia. And he called to give me the good 
news that hostages had been rescued, including<Gonsalves, 
Marc<ls-thn-eq> three<Howes, Thomas<ls-thn-eq> Americans<Stansell, 
Keith<ls-thn-eq> that had been held since 2003. I congratulated the 
President. I asked him to congratulate his military and those who had 
planned it. And I told him what a joyous occasion it must be to know 
that the plan had worked, that people who were unjustly held are now 
free to be with their families.
    And so I'm proud of our relationship with Colombia, and I'm proud of 
my friend President Uribe.<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> And I 
appreciate his courage and his strong leadership and the successful 
operations they waged.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 11:56 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell, former hostages held 
by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
