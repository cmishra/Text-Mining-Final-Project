Statement on Senate Confirmation of Carol Moseley-Braun<Moseley-Braun, 
Carol> To Be Ambassador to New Zealand
November 10, 1999

    I am very pleased that the Senate has confirmed Carol Moseley-Braun 
to be our Nation's Ambassador to New Zealand. The Senate's overwhelming 
bipartisan vote is a strong endorsement of her outstanding experience 
and credentials for this position. I appreciate her willingness to take 
on this responsibility, and I expect her to do a superior job 
representing our country's interests in New Zealand.
