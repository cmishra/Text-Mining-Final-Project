Remarks on Signing the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004
April 1, 2004

    Thank you for coming. Thank you all. Please be seated. Thanks for 
the warm welcome. [Laughter] Welcome to the people's house, the White 
House. I'm pleased that you all could be here for the first bill signing 
ceremony of the year 2004.
    The Unborn Victims of Violence Act provides that, under Federal law, 
any person who causes death or injury to a child in the womb shall be 
charged with a separate offense, in addition to any charges relating to 
the mother. As of today, the law of our Nation will acknowledge the 
plain fact that crimes of violence against a pregnant woman often have 
two victims. And therefore, in those cases, there are two offenses to be 
punished. Under this law, those who direct violence toward a pregnant 
woman will answer for the full extent of the harm they have done and for 
all the crimes they have committed.
    I appreciate Members of the United States Congress who have joined 
us today. Majority Leader Bill Frist<Frist, Bill<ls-thn-eq> is with us 
from the Senate. Thank you for coming. Majority Leader Tom DeLay<DeLay, 
Tom<ls-thn-eq> of the House of Representatives, Members from both 
political parties have joined us. I appreciate the Members on stage 
here. House bill sponsor Congresswoman Melissa Hart<Hart, 
Melissa<ls-thn-eq> from Pennsylvania is with us. Senate sponsor Senator 
Mike DeWine<DeWine, Mike<ls-thn-eq> from Ohio is with us. And the 
chairmen of the Judiciary Committees, Senator Orrin Hatch<Hatch, Orrin 
G.<ls-thn-eq> and Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner,<Sensenbrenner, F. 
James, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> are with us as well. Thank you all. I appreciate 
those in attendance today from across the country who have worked hard 
to get this bill passed.
    I also want to thank Sharon Rocha<Rocha, Sharon<ls-thn-eq> and her 
husband, Ron Grantski,<Grantski, Ron<ls-thn-eq> for joining us today. 
This act of Congress addresses tragic losses such as Sharon and Ron have 
known. They have laid to rest their daughter Laci,<Peterson, 
Laci<ls-thn-eq> a beautiful young woman who was joyfully awaiting the 
arrival of a new son. They have also laid to rest that child, a boy 
named Conner, who was waiting to be born when his life too was taken. 
His little soul never saw light, but he was loved, and he is remembered. 
And his name is forever joined with that of his mom in this statute, 
which is also known as Laci and Conner's law. All who knew Laci Peterson 
have mourned two deaths, and the law cannot look away and pretend there 
was just one.
    Each of these families on this stage has lost a child or a 
grandchild or both. Carol<Lyons, Carol<ls-thn-eq> and Buford 
Lyons,<Lyons, Buford<ls-thn-eq> Tracy Marciniak-

Seavers,<Marciniak-Seavers, Tracy<ls-thn-eq> Stephanie Alberts,<Alberts, 
Stephanie<ls-thn-eq> Cynthia Warner,<Warner, Cynthia<ls-thn-eq> I thank 
you all for your courage for coming today.
    As these and the other families understand, any time an expectant 
mother is a victim of violence, two lives are in the balance, each 
deserving protection and each deserving justice. If the crime is murder 
and the unborn child's life ends, justice demands a full accounting 
under the law.
    Until today, the Federal Criminal Code had been silent on the injury 
or death of a child in cases of violence against a pregnant woman. This 
omission in the law has led to clear injustices. The death of an 
innocent unborn child has too often been treated as a detail in one 
crime but not a crime in itself. Police and prosecutors had been to 
crime scenes and have shared the grief of families but have so often 
been unable to seek justice for the full offense. The American people as 
well have learned of these cases, and they urged action. The swift 
bipartisan passage of this bill through Congress this year indicates a 
strong consensus that the suffering of two victims can never equal only 
one offense.
    The moral concern of humanity extends to those unborn children who 
are harmed or killed in crimes against their mothers. And now, the 
protection of Federal law extends to those children as well. With this 
action, we widen the circle of compassion and inclusion in our society, 
and we reaffirm that the United States of America is building a culture 
of life.
    It is now my honor to sign the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 
2004.

Note: The President spoke at 2:57 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. H.R. 1997, approved April 1, was assigned Public Law No. 108-212.
