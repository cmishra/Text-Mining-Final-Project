Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
February 11, 1997

    First, I want to thank Senator Lott for hosting this. I thank the 
Speaker and Senator Lott and the leadership for inviting us to come down 
here and meet with the bipartisan leadership today. I think it's a very 
important first step after the State of the Union Address. It indicates 
we want to work together.
    We'll discuss a lot of issues, I'm sure. I just want to emphasize, 
too, I think it's imperative that we pass a bipartisan balanced budget 
this year. And I think it's imperative that we find a way to work 
together on education reform, and we'll be talking about how we can do 
that. There are many other things, but I want to emphasize those two 
above all.
    The reception that I received in Maryland yesterday was a reception 
for the importance of education standards and educational opportunity in 
America as we move into this new century. And so I'm optimistic, I'm 
hopeful, and I'm gratified to be invited to be here.

Note: The President spoke at 11:10 a.m. in the President's Bill Signing 
Room at the Capitol. A tape was not available for verification of the 
content of these remarks.
