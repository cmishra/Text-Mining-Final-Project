Statement on the Death of Joe DiMaggio<DiMaggio, Joe>
March 8, 1999

    Today America lost one of the century's most beloved heroes, Joe 
DiMaggio. This son of Italian immigrants gave every American something 
to believe in. He became the very symbol of American grace, power, and 
skill. A brilliant individual performer, he led his magnificent Yankees 
to the World Series 10 out of his 13 years. His electrifying 56-game 
hitting streak, unequaled to this day, is one of the most remarkable 
achievements by any athlete in any sport.
    He stood tall off the field as well. In 1943 he volunteered for the 
Army and swapped his Yankee paycheck for $50-a-month private's salary. 
He and the foundation he started gave mightily to help poor children 
benefit from the world's best medical care. And he was an incredibly 
devoted father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.
    I have no doubt that when future generations look back at the best 
of America in the 20th century, they will think of the ``Yankee 
Clipper'' and all that he achieved. Hillary and I extend our thoughts 
and prayers to his family.
