Statement on Congressional Action on a National Blood Alcohol Content 
Standard To Combat Drunk Driving
October 3, 2000

    Congress took a courageous step today to save lives by keeping drunk 
drivers off the roads. This morning House and Senate conferees approved 
a transportation spending bill that includes a critical measure to help 
set a nationwide impaired driving standard of .08 blood alcohol content 
(BAC). This commonsense nationwide limit will save an estimated 500 
lives a year and prevent thousands of injuries.
    Our progress on .08 BAC marks a new milestone in our ongoing effort 
to crack down on drunk driving. It is the result of years of hard work 
by safety advocates across the country. I applaud Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving and the more then 400 young people visiting Washington today who 
have put a national spotlight on this critical safety measure. I also 
want to commend the tireless efforts and leadership of Senators Frank 
Lautenberg<Lautenberg, Frank R.> and Richard Shelby,<Shelby, 
Richard C.> Representatives Frank Wolf<Wolf, Frank 
R.> and Nita Lowey,<Lowey, Nita M.> as well as U.S. 
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.<Slater, Rodney E.> 
Today's remarkable achievement shows that when we work together, we can 
make America's streets and highways safer for all.
