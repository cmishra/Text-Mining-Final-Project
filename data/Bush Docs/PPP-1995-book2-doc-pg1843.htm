Message to the Congress on Administration of Export Controls
December 5, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    In order to take additional steps with respect to the national 
emergency described and declared in Executive Order No. 12924 of August 
19, 1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, necessitated by the 
expiration of the Export Administration Act on August 20, 1994, I hereby 
report to the Congress that pursuant to section 204(b) of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) (``the 
Act''), I have today exercised the authority granted by the Act to issue 
an Executive order (a copy of which is attached) to revise the existing 
procedures for processing export license applications submitted to the 
Department of Commerce.
    The Executive order establishes two basic principles for processing 
export license applications submitted to the Department of Commerce 
under the Act and the Regulations, or under any renewal of, or successor 
to, the Export Administration Act and the Regulations. First, all such 
license applications must be resolved or referred to me for resolution 
no later than 90 calendar days after they are submitted to the 
Department of Commerce. Second, the Departments of State, Defense, and 
Energy, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency will have the 
authority to review any such license application. In addition, the 
Executive order sets forth specific procedures including intermediate 
time frames, for review and resolution of such license applications.
    The Executive order is designed to make the licensing process more 
efficient and transparent for exporters while ensuring that our national 
security, foreign policy, and nonproliferation interests remain fully 
protected.

                                                      William J. Clinton
