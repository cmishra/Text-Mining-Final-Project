Letter to Congressional Leaders on Line-Item Veto Legislation
June 7, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Leader:)
    I am deeply alarmed by today's press report that some Republicans in 
the House and Senate want to continue to hold back the line-item veto so 
that I don't have it during this year's budget process. The line-item 
veto is a vital tool to cut pork from the budget. If this Congress is 
serious about deficit reduction, it must pass the strongest possible 
line-item veto immediately, and send it to my desk so I can sign it 
right away.
    This is not a partisan issue. Presidents Reagan and Bush asked 
Congress for it time and again, and so have I. It was part of the 
Republican Contract with America. It has strong support from members of 
Congress in both parties and both houses. No matter what party the 
President belongs to or what party has a majority in Congress, the line-
item veto would be good for America.
    If Congress will send me the line-item veto immediately, I am 
willing to pledge that this

year, I will use it only to cut spending, not on tax expenditures in 
this year's budget. I have already put you on notice that I will veto 
any budget that is loaded with excessive tax breaks for the wealthy. But 
I need the line-item veto now to hold the line against pork in every 
bill the Congress sends me.
    The American people have waited long enough. Congress should give 
them and the Presidency the line-item veto without further delay.
        Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Bob Dole, Senate majority leader. This letter 
was made available by the Office of the Press Secretary but was not 
issued as a White House press release.
