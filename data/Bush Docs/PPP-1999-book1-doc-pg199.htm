Statement on Senator Frank R. Lautenberg's<Lautenberg, Frank 
R.> Decision Not To Seek Reelection
February 17, 1999

    Senator Frank Lautenberg has been a great public servant and a 
principled champion of the people of New Jersey and the children of 
America. He has done as much as any other citizen to protect our young 
people from tobacco, was the author of the national law raising the 
drinking age, and passed legislation barring those convicted of domestic 
abuse from owning guns. He has led our efforts to pass a clean 
environment on to the next generation. With his hardheaded business 
sense, he has helped bring balance to the books of the Federal 
Government, working with me to craft a balanced budget that invests in 
the education and health care of our people. Frank Lautenberg has been 
tough, tireless, and tremendously effective. And more than that, he has 
been a great friend. Hillary and I wish him the best.
