Trilateral Summit Joint Press Statement
September 12, 1999

    United States President William Jefferson Clinton, Republic of Korea 
President Kim Dae-jung<Kim Dae-jung> and Japanese Prime 
Minister Obuchi Keizo<Obuchi, Keizo> met today in Auckland to 
continue to coordinate their respective policies toward the DPRK and to 
discuss regional and global issues.
    The three<Obuchi, Keizo> leaders<Kim Dae-jung> 
expressed their expectation that the comprehensive and integrated 
approach developed jointly by the U.S., the ROK, and Japan provides an 
invaluable opportunity to ensure peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula, and they also expressed their hope that the DPRK responds 
positively to the concepts discussed by Dr.<Perry, William J.> 
Perry during his visit to Pyongyang last May.
    The three<Obuchi, Keizo> leaders<Kim Dae-jung> 
confirmed that they are prepared to undertake measures to improve their 
respective relations with the DPRK as the DPRK addresses the concerns of 
the U.S., ROK, and Japan, and takes steps to reduce tensions and 
establish lasting peace on the Korean peninsula and beyond.
    The<Obuchi, Keizo> leaders<Kim Dae-jung> 
confirmed that the 1994 Agreed Framework serves as an integral part of 
their joint efforts as they seek improved relations with the DPRK.
    The three<Obuchi, Keizo> leaders<Kim Dae-jung> 
reconfirmed their commitment to continue to act in close coordination at 
all times.
    The<Obuchi, Keizo> leaders<Kim Dae-jung> 
expressed grave concern over the continuing violence and resulting 
humanitarian disaster in East Timor. They reaffirmed that the primary 
responsibility of restoring law and order in East Timor resides with the 
Indonesian government, and urged the Indonesian government to take 
prompt measures to ensure that the free will of the East Timorese 
people, as clearly expressed in the referendum of August 30, be fully 
respected. They agreed to work closely with the United Nations and other 
members of the international community toward that end, keeping in mind 
the desirability of maintaining the stability of Indonesia as a whole in 
order to avoid possible negative consequences which might arise in the 
region.
    The three<Obuchi, Keizo> leaders<Kim Dae-jung> 
welcomed the fairly smooth progress being made in the efforts to 
overcome the Asian financial crisis as various economic indicators show 
signs of economic recovery, and have agreed to cooperate closely in 
order to sustain the momentum for recovery of the Asian countries. They 
underscored the need for APEC economies to work together for the 
successful launching of a new three-year WTO Round at the November 
Seattle WTO Ministerial. They agreed that the region's leaders must stay 
the course with politically difficult macroeconomic and structural 
reforms to sustain the region's recovery.
