Statement on Congressional Action on Election Reform Legislation
October 16, 2002

    The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy. I commend the 
House and Senate for passing legislation to improve our election 
process. The legislation is consistent with the principles outlined by 
the bipartisan Ford-Carter Commission that respect the primacy of State 
and local governments and envision a limited but responsible role for 
the Federal Government. I look forward to signing these important 
election reforms into law.
