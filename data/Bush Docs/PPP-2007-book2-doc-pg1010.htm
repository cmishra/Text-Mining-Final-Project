Remarks Following a Briefing by the President's Commission on Care for 
America's Returning Wounded Warriors
July 25, 2007

    I want to thank Secretary Shalala<Shalala, Donna E.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Senator Dole<Dole, Robert J.<ls-thn-eq> for briefing myself and the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs,<Nicholson, R. James<ls-thn-eq> Secretary 
of Defense<Gates, Robert M.<ls-thn-eq> on the general recommendations 
they'll be making to the country about how to make sure that our wounded 
heroes get the best possible care from the Defense Department and the 
Veterans Affairs Department.
    I asked these two distinguished<Shalala, Donna E.<ls-thn-eq> 
citizens<Dole, Robert J.<ls-thn-eq> to lead an extensive search about 
how best for this Government to respond. We owe a wounded soldier the 
very best care and the very best benefits and the very easiest-to-
understand system. And so they took a very interesting approach, and 
that they took the perspective from the patient, as the patient had to 
work his way through the hospitals and bureaucracies. And they've come 
up with some very interesting and important suggestions that they'll be 
voting on later and then will be holding a press conference about 
afterwards.
    The reason I've asked you to come in is, I do want to thank you on 
behalf of the Nation for doing what's right.
    I also want to recognize Bob Woodruff<Woodruff, Bob<ls-thn-eq> here. 
He is a--he himself was wounded, severely wounded and went through the 
system, to a certain extent. And we welcome you back, and we're glad 
you're with us. And we would hope that any wounded soldier, any person 
in uniform would receive the kind of care and the ability to return to 
work, just like you have done. And so we're glad you're with us, Bob. 
Congratulations on the will to recover.

    That will exists with our troops as well. It's amazing how 
courageous our men and women in uniform are, and they deserve the best. 
And that's the spirit in which you analyzed the system. And we welcome 
your recommendations, and we thank you for your service.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:34 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to former Secretary of Health and 
Human Services Donna E. Shalala and former Sen. Robert J. Dole, 
Cochairs, President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded 
Warriors; Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates; and ABC News reporter 
Bob Woodruff, who was injured in Iraq on January 29, 2006. The Office of 
the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of these 
remarks.
