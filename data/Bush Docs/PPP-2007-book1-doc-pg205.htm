Remarks Following a Visit With Gulf Coast Grant Recipients in Long 
Beach, Mississippi
March 1, 2007

    You know, it's interesting to come back down here to the gulf coast. 
I tried to think back about what it was like the first time I came after 
the storm hit. And I guess the--my most vivid recollection is the piles 
of rubble, literally debris stacked upon debris. It was--it's hard to 
believe then that I would be--I had faith that I'd be able to come to a 
home, but I had trouble visualizing it. And then I kept coming down, and 
I watched the improvement, because of the hard work of the local 
citizens--people like the mayor<Skellie, William J.<ls-thn-eq> here and 
the Governor,<Barbour, Haley<ls-thn-eq> who set a vision that was a 
hopeful vision.
    The Federal Government's role has been to write checks. The 
Governor's<Barbour, Haley<ls-thn-eq> role and the mayor's<Skellie, 
William J.<ls-thn-eq> role is help to expedite the Federal money to the 
local folks. And today we are able to sit in a homeowner--the<Woodward, 
Cheryl<ls-thn-eq> Woodwards'<Woodward, Ernie<ls-thn-eq> home. Again, one 
of the things I like to say is, when somebody walks in, ``Welcome to my 
home.'' And it has a special ring to it here in the gulf coast, because 
there was a time when their home was totally destroyed.
    Part of the reason I've come down is to tell the people here in the 
gulf coast that we still think about them in Washington, and that we 
listen to the Governor<Barbour, Haley<ls-thn-eq> when he speaks. The 
other reason I've come down is I want the taxpayers of the United States 
to see firsthand what their money has done to help revitalize a series 
of communities that were literally wiped out because of a major storm.
    It's a--this is a hopeful day. There's obviously a lot more work to 
be done. You can see vacant lots where there's going to be new building. 
There's still work to be done here in Mississippi, and the 
Governor<Barbour, Haley<ls-thn-eq> and I are going to go listen to some 
of the local officials describe to me what's on their mind and how we 
can continue to help. But times are changing for the better, and 
people's lives are improving, and there is hope. And I congratulate the 
good folks in this part of the country for their resiliency, their 
courage, and the fact that they never abandoned hope.
    So thank you for giving us a chance to come by. We're proud to be 
with you. Love being with you. Thank you all for your hospitality. 
Appreciate it. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 10:11 a.m. at the home of Cheryl and Ernie 
Woodward. In his remarks, he referred to Mayor William Skellie, Jr., of 
Long Beach, MS; and Gov. Haley R. Barbour of Mississippi.
