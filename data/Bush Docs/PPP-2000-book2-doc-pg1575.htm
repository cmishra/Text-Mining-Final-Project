Exchange With Reporters in Martha's Vineyard
August 7, 2000

Senator Joseph I. Lieberman<Lieberman, Joseph I.>

    Q.  What do you make of Gore's selection of Senator Lieberman?
    The President.  Well, first of all, this is a very important choice, 
and the Vice President<Gore, Albert, Jr.> is going to make his 
announcement tomorrow, so I don't want to comment on that. But I'll be 
glad to tell you what I think of Senator Lieberman. He's been a friend 
of mine for 30 years. I supported him when I was a law student at Yale, 
and he was running for the State Senate--he wasn't even 30 years old 
then--and I think he's one of the most outstanding people in public 
life.
    I've worked with him for 15 years or more through the Democratic 
Leadership Council. He's a bold thinker. He's always full of new ideas, 
and he's supported the changes that we've made over the last 8 years 
that have turned America around and moved America forward. I think he's 
just an extraordinary guy. I like him. I know his family. I like his 
family members, whom I know. I just think he's an amazing person.
    And we've talked a lot over the years about the Middle East peace 
process and every conceivable domestic issue. He's an extraordinary, 
extraordinary human being, as well as a longtime friend of mine. So I 
think he's terrific.
    I think that the important thing now is--I know you'll will have a 
lot of questions you want to ask me and everybody else, but I'd rather 
not say anything else today. Let's let the Vice President<Gore, Albert, 
Jr.> make his announcement tomorrow, and then I'll be glad to 
answer any other questions you have.
    But I think right now, you just need to know that I think he's 
wonderful, and he's been a wonderful friend to me, and he's been great 
for America these last 8 years with what he's done in the Senate. And 
he's been great for our party with what he's done through the Democratic 
Leadership Council. So I'm very happy about Joe Lieberman. But I think 
we ought to let the announcement be made by the Vice President. You guys 
ask the questions later. I'll be ready to answer all the questions.

Note: The exchange began at noon at the U.S. Coast Guard Station at West 
Chop Lighthouse. A tape was not available for verification of the 
content of this exchange.
