Statement on Welfare Reform
August 17, 1995

    In the past 2\1/2\ years, as part of my continuing effort to make 
Government better reflect the values of the American people, my 
administration has granted more State welfare reform experiments than in 
the past 12 years combined. Today, 33 States are experimenting in 
requiring welfare recipients to work for their benefits, requiring teen 
moms to live at home and stay in school, requiring delinquent parents to 
pay child support, and requiring recipients to be held to a time limit.
    I am offering States a new, simpler way to achieve welfare reform. 
My fast-track demonstration initiative will let States build on 
strategies we already know are moving people from welfare to work. We 
must replace our broken welfare system with one that reflects the 
fundamental American values of work, responsibility, and family. When 
Congress returns, they should immediately put welfare reform at the top 
of their agenda and send me a tough, bipartisan bill that builds upon 
our progress. In the meantime, I will continue to do everything in my 
power to move welfare reform forward in the States and in Washington.
