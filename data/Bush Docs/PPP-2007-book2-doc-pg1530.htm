 Remarks on Lighting the National Christmas Tree
December 6, 2007

    Mr. Secretary,<Kempthorne, Dirk<ls-thn-eq> thank you for that kind 
introduction, and thank you all for joining us. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are pleased to welcome you on this joyous 
occasion. As the Secretary said, in a few moments, we will light the 
National Christmas Tree. And as he also said, this is a tradition that 
dates back to President Calvin Coolidge.
    There's one person with us today who remembers that first annual 
Christmas tree lighting, and, Santa, we are glad you're here. [Laughter] 
We know this is a busy time of year for you, and we're thrilled you're 
here. And we really appreciate you bringing Mrs. Claus. Both you and I 
married well. [Laughter]
    I appreciate the members of my Cabinet for joining us, Members of 
the Congress. I want to thank Vin Cipolla,<Cipolla, Vin<ls-thn-eq> Mary 
Bomar.<Bomar, Mary A.<ls-thn-eq> I particularly want to thank the men 
and women who work for the National Park Service.
    Pastor,<Freeman, Roger P.<ls-thn-eq> thank you for your blessing. I 
believe these entertainers didn't disappoint anyone. We're proud you're 
here, and thank you for your beautiful music.
    Christmas is a time of rejoicing and reflection. Each year at this 
time, we rejoice in the proclamation of good news, that in Bethlehem of 
Judea, a Savior was born. And we rejoice in the Christmas promise of 
peace to men of good will. We also reflect on the mystery of Christmas, 
the story of the Almighty, who entered history in the most vulnerable 
form possible, hidden in the weakness of a newborn child. And we reflect 
on the call of our Creator, who by taking this form, reminds us of our 
duty to protect and care for the weak and the vulnerable among us.
    During this Christmas season, millions of Americans will answer this 
call by reaching out a compassionate hand to help brothers and sisters 
in need. We are thankful for these good souls who show the good heart of 
our Nation. We're also thankful for the thousands of Americans who 
answer the call by serving our Nation in uniform. Many will spend this 
Christmas stationed in distant and dangerous lands, far from homes and 
from the families they love. They are never far from our thoughts, and 
they're always in our prayers. America honors their sacrifice and that 
of their families, who also serve our Nation. We're grateful for all 
they do to ensure that we live in the freedom our Creator intended for 
every man, woman, and child on the face of this Earth.
    And now, as an expression of our hope for peace in this Christmas 
season, we're going to light the National Christmas Tree. And we have 
asked two young Americans to join us. Brianna Kinder<Kinder, 
Brianna<ls-thn-eq> helps others through her participation in the 
Montgomery County Police Activities League's Kids Care Club. And 
Damarcus Hawkins<Hawkins, Damarcus<ls-thn-eq> gives his time as part of 
the Discovery Creek Children's Museum service learning program.

    And now if Brianna<Kinder, Brianna<ls-thn-eq> and Damarcus<Hawkins, 
Damarcus<ls-thn-eq> will join Laura,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and if you 
will join me in a countdown: five, four, three, two, one.

Note: The President spoke at 5:55 p.m. on the Ellipse at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Secretary of the Interior Dirk 
Kempthorne, who introduced the President; Vin Cipolla, president and 
chief executive officer, National Park Foundation; and Rev. Roger P. 
Freeman, senior pastor, First Baptist Church, Clarksville, TN.
