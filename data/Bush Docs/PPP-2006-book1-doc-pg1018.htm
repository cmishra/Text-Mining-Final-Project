Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Energy Legislation
May 25, 2006

    I applaud today's vote in the House to allow for environmentally 
responsible energy exploration in a small part of the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge. A reliable domestic supply of energy is important to 
America's security and prosperity. This project will keep our economy 
growing by creating jobs and ensuring that businesses can expand. And it 
will make America less dependent on foreign sources of energy, 
eventually by up to a million barrels of crude oil a day--a nearly 20 
percent increase over our current domestic production. I thank the House 
leadership and Chairman Pombo<Pombo, Richard W.<ls-thn-eq> for their 
hard work on this issue. I urge the Senate to join the House in passing 
ANWR legislation.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 5429.
