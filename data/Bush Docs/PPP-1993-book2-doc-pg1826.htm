Statement on Federal Procurement Reforms
October 26, 1993

    American taxpayers have a right to expect that their Federal dollars 
are being put to the best possible use. The current Federal procurement 
system is inefficient and wasteful. It adds significant costs without 
providing extra value. It's time the Federal Government viewed Federal 
purchasing as a major source of savings by creating a more efficient and 
responsive Federal procurement system.
    If Congress does their part and we do our part in the 
administration, procurement reforms in the first year alone will save 
enough money to fund something Americans care deeply about, fighting 
crime by fighting drugs and putting more police on the streets all 
across our country.

Note: The President's statement was included in a White House statement 
announcing procurement reforms and spending cut proposals.
