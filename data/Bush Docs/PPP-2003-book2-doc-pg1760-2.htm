Statement on the Earthquake in Iran
December 26, 2003

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I heard this morning of the 
earthquake centered in the city of Bam, Iran. We are greatly saddened by 
the loss of life, injuries, and widespread damage to this ancient city. 
I extend my condolences to all those touched by this tragedy. The 
thoughts of all Americans are with the victims and their families at 
this time, and we stand ready to help the people of Iran.
