Statement on United States Military Training on Vieques Island, Puerto 
Rico
December 3, 1999

    For several weeks, we have been working on how best to reconcile the 
imperative of providing satisfactory training for our Armed Forces, with 
the strong feelings of many residents of Vieques and Puerto Rico about 
the impact of training operations there. I have discussed this with the 
Governor of Puerto Rico,<Rossello, Pedro> the Secretary of 
Defense,<Cohen, William S.> the Secretary of the Navy,<Danzig, 
Richard> the Chief of Naval Operations,<Johnson, 
J.L.> the Commandant of the Marine Corps,<Krulak, Charles 
C.> and others.
    Today the Secretary of Defense<Cohen, William S.> has 
recommended a plan of action which I believe offers the best avenue to 
addressing both needs. I have accepted that recommendation and am 
directing the Secretary of Defense to work with the people of Vieques 
and Puerto Rico so that we can move forward in a cooperative manner.
    I understand the longstanding concerns of residents of the island. 
These concerns cover a wide range of issues, from health and safety to 
the economy and the environment. They reflect a distrust that, 
unfortunately, has been building for decades. Those concerns must be 
addressed, and I believe our plan will do so in a constructive manner.
    At the same time, as Commander in Chief, I cannot send our service 
men and women into harm's way if they have not been adequately trained. 
The training that our Atlantic Fleet has undertaken on Vieques since 
1941 is important. While the Navy and the Marine Corps will develop a 
satisfactory alternative for the upcoming exercise, it will take several 
years to develop a comparable long-term replacement.
    The plan I am adopting today provides for the end of training on 
Vieques within 5 years, unless the people of Vieques choose to continue

the relationship; restricts training activities during the transition 
period to those required by the Services; sets forth an ambitious 
economic development plan for Vieques that would be implemented during 
this transition; and gives the people of Puerto Rico and the Navy an 
opportunity to discuss this plan in order for it to be understood fully 
before training resumes this spring for this transitional period.
    In particular, the following steps will be undertaken:
    First, the Navy and the Marine Corps will make alternative 
arrangements which they deem satisfactory for training of the Eisenhower 
Battle Group and the WASP Amphibious Ready Group, scheduled for 
December. While such arrangements can be undertaken for the Eisenhower 
and WASP groups, they do not constitute a long-term alternative to 
Vieques. Rather, this period will provide an opportunity for the people 
of Vieques to discuss this plan with the Navy and the Marine Corps and 
understand it fully.
    Second, we will resume training next spring for a transition period, 
no longer than 5 years. This will enable the Navy to develop a suitable, 
long-term alternative. Training on Vieques will cease after this 
transition period unless the people of Vieques decide it should be 
continued. The Navy and the Marine Corps will develop a timetable to 
phase out operations in Vieques as soon as possible during the 
transition period, including transferring title of land to Puerto Rico 
beginning with the western quarter of the island.
    Third, when training resumes for this transition period, it will be 
limited to inert ordnance only--no live fire--unless and until the 
people of Vieques decide differently. Training will be authorized for 90 
days a year, what we need to meet our essential training needs.
    Finally, when training resumes, we will implement an ambitious 
program that addresses the concerns that the community has had for so 
long and that has been spelled out by the Secretary of Defense.<Cohen, 
William S.>
    I am convinced that this plan meets my essential responsibility as 
Commander in Chief to assure that our military forces are satisfactorily 
trained and ready, while at the same time addressing the legitimate 
concerns of the people of Vieques. It provides some breathing space so 
that the people on the island and the Navy and Marine Corps can proceed 
in an orderly and mutually respectful fashion.
