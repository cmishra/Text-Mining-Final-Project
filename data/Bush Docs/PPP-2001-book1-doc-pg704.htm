Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Representative-Elect J. Randy 
Forbes<Forbes, J. Randy<ls-thn-eq>
June 20, 2001

    The President. It is my honor to welcome the newest Member of the 
United States Congress to the Oval Office. Randy Forbes ran a great 
race. He won a race a lot of folks didn't think he could win. And he did 
it because he talked about issues that mattered to the people of 
Virginia: tax relief, Social Security reform, strong national defense.
    We all knew he was a good candidate. We didn't realize how good 
until the results came in last night. So it's an honor for the Vice 
President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> and me, the chairman of the 
party,<Gilmore, James S., III<ls-thn-eq> Congressman Davis,<Davis, 
Thomas M.<ls-thn-eq> to welcome you both to the Oval Office and 
congratulate you and look forward to working with you.
    Representative Forbes. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And it's an 
exciting victory for us, and we couldn't have done it without the help 
from you, Mr. President, and the Vice President, and also the great 
chairman of our party and chairman of the congressional committee. They 
all just put so many resources together and made this victory possible.
    The President. Congratulations.
    Representative Forbes. Thank you.
    The President. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 11:10 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. James S. Gilmore III of 
Virginia, chairman, Republican National Committee; and Representative 
Tom Davis, chairman, National Republican Congressional Committee.
