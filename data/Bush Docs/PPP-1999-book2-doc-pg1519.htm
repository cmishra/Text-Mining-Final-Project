Statement on House Action on Proposed Appropriations Legislation for the 
Corporation for National and Community Service
September 10, 1999

    I am deeply dismayed that the House has passed an appropriations 
bill that includes no funding for the Corporation for National and 
Community Service. Since 1994, and with broad bipartisan support, 
AmeriCorps has given over 100,000 of our young people the opportunity to 
serve community and country. It has enabled Americans from every walk of 
life to work together to revitalize our neighborhoods and schools. The 
House's action sends exactly the wrong message to young Americans who 
want to make a difference in their communities. I have said before, and 
say again now, that I will veto any bill that inadequately funds 
AmeriCorps. But I hope that we can work with Members of Congress from 
both parties to restore full funding for this vital program.
