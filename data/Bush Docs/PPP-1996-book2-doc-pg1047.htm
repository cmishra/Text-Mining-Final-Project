Statement on Assistance for Livestock Producers
July 1, 1996

    Our Nation's livestock producers are hurting. A severe drought in 
the Southwest has reduced available forage in pastures while raising the 
cost of cattle feed. Producers also have been hurt by low beef prices.
    I am taking action today to help livestock producers weather these 
tough times. Specifically, I am declaring a State of Emergency in the 
Southwest and other areas, enabling the Secretary of Agriculture to 
release about $40 million in needed assistance to producers from the 
Feed Grain Disaster Reserve.
    The Department of Agriculture will sell about 15 million bushels of 
grain from the Disaster Reserve, in order to make disaster assistance 
payments to livestock producers in the drought region. The Department 
will make the sales in a way that minimizes market disruptions.
    Secretary Glickman and Deputy Secretary Rominger recently visited 
some of the areas hardest hit by the drought, and I have heard from 
Members of Congress and others about the situation there. I know how 
badly producers are suffering, and I am determined to do whatever I can 
to help.

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: The proclamation on the declaration of a state of emergency and 
release of feed grain from the disaster reserve is listed in Appendix D 
at the end of this volume. An original was not available for 
verification of the content of this statement.
