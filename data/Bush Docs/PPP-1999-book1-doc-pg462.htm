Remarks on the NATO Airstrikes Against Serbian Targets and an Exchange 
With Reporters
March 28, 1999

    The President. Good afternoon. All Americans can be very proud of 
the skill and bravery of the American servicemen involved in the rescue 
operation yesterday in Kosovo. Indeed, we can be proud of all of our men 
and women in uniform who are involved in the NATO mission.
    From the outset, I have said to the American people that this 
military operation entails real risks. But the continued brutality and 
repression of the Serb forces further underscores the need for NATO to 
persevere. I strongly support Secretary General Solana's<Solana, 
Javier> decision yesterday to move to a new phase in our 
planned air campaign, with a broader range of targets including air 
defenses, military and security targets, and forces in the field.
    In the last 24 hours, I have been in close contact with key NATO 
Allies, including Prime Minister Blair,<Blair, Tony> President 
Chirac,<Chirac, Jacques> Chancellor Schroeder,<Schroeder, 
Gerhard> and Prime Minister <D'Alema, 
Massimo>D'Alema. All of them share our determination to 
respond strongly to Mr. Milosevic's<Milosevic, Slobodan> 
continuing campaign of inhumane and violence against the Kosovar 
Albanian people. That is what we intend to do.
    Thank you very much.
    Q. Has the bombing made things worse, sir?
    Q. Sir, is the allied bombing driving the atrocities, sir?
    The President. Absolutely not.

Note: The President spoke at 2:15 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House, prior to his departure for Camp David, MD. In his remarks, the 
President referred to NATO Secretary General Javier Solana; Prime 
Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom; President Jacques Chirac of 
France; Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany; Prime Minister Massimo 
D'Alema of Italy; and President Slobodan Milosevic of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
