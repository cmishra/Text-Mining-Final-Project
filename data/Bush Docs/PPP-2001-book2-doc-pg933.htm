Statement on House of Representatives Action To Prohibit Human Cloning
July 31, 2001

    The moral issues posed by human cloning are profound and have 
implications for today and for future generations. Today's overwhelming 
and bipartisan House action to prohibit human cloning is a strong 
ethical statement, which I commend. We must advance the promise and 
cause of science but must do so in a way that honors and respects life.
