Statement on the Violence in South Africa
March 28, 1994

    We condemn the violence that took place in the streets of 
Johannesburg and elsewhere in South Africa in recent days. The United 
States calls on all South African parties to reject violence and 
intimidation and to work towards a peaceful transition to a nonracial 
democracy.

[[Page 558]]

    Those who are responsible for brutal acts of terror must not be 
allowed to impede South Africa's historic transformation. We urge an 
aggressive investigation into these violent actions so that the culprits 
can be brought to justice.
