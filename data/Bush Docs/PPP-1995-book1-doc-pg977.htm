Statement on the Observance of Independence Day, 1995
June 29, 1995

    I am delighted to join my fellow Americans in celebrating 
Independence Day.
    Commemorating the birth of the greatest democracy in the world, the 
Fourth of July is a testament to all that is unique about America. Born 
of the courage of our founders and sustained by the spirit and sacrifice 
of every generation since, our nation has built a proud legacy of 
liberty. On this day, millions of our citizens join friends and loved 
ones at picnics and parades to rejoice in the blessings of freedom. 
People of all backgrounds unite in celebrating the energy and optimism 
that have always defined us as a people.
    We are blessed that our country is better able than any other to 
face the trials and embrace the opportunities of the next century. 
Holding fast to the noble principles on which America was founded, we 
must look toward tomorrow with the same love of freedom, faith in 
justice, and firm commitment to moving forward together. These ideals, 
which have seen us through more than two centuries of challenge and 
change, will bring us ever closer to a future of hope, prosperity, and 
peace.
    Best wishes to all for a wonderful celebration.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: An identical message was also made available by the White House.
