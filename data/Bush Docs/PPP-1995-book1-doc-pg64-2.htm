Message on the Observance of National African American History Month, 
February 1995
January 20, 1995

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating African American History 
Month, 1995.
    Hillary and I join you in marking the brave efforts of the countless 
Americans throughout our nation's history who have demanded justice, 
declared an end to segregation, and fought to ensure that every 
individual has the opportunity to build a brighter future for themselves 
and their families.
    Today, there is a renewed sense of hope in America--a hope based on 
the idea that our great diversity can unite rather than divide our 
society. It is the same hope that has inspired African Americans since 
ur country's beginnings to dream of a nation in which all people enjoy 
the freedom to make their own lasting contributions to our world. If we 
are truly to build on history's rich lessons, we must always remember 
these pioneers' pivotal roles in American history.
    Ours can be a land of unprecedented peace and prosperity in the 
twenty-first century if we have the faith that Martin Luther King 
described, the faith to ``transform the jangling discords of our nation 
into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.'' We must never cease striving 
to bring people together across racial and cultural barriers. This is 
our generation's most solemn calling and most important challenge.
    I urge everyone, during African American History Month and 
throughout the year, to take up this challenge and to learn more about 
the black Americans who have made this country great.

                                                            Bill Clinton
