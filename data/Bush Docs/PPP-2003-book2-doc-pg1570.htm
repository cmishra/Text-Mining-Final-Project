Remarks Following a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
November 17, 2003

    I just had the honor of meeting with the Medicare Conference Working 
Group. I first thanked them for their extraordinary leadership on 
developing a fine piece of legislation for Medicare. There are 
Republican leaders at this table; there are Democrat leaders at this 
table. These are Americans who understand we have an obligation to our 
seniors to modernize and strengthen the Medicare system.
    The bill that will be offered to the House and the Senate modernizes 
and strengthens Medicare. There's 400 billion additional dollars 
available for our seniors in this bill. There's prescription drug 
coverage in the bill for our seniors. This vote will demonstrate whether 
the Members of the House and the Senate will help keep our commitment to 
America's seniors. I look forward to working with the Members

around the table to secure passage of this very important and historic 
piece of legislation. I urge members of both political parties to study 
the legislation, to remember the promise we have made to America's 
seniors, and to vote yes for this legislation.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 4:20 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
