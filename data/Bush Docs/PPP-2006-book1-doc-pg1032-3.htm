Statement on Senate Confirmation of Dirk Kempthorne<Kempthorne, 
Dirk<ls-thn-eq> as the Secretary of the Interior
May 26, 2006

    I applaud the Senate for confirming Dirk Kempthorne as Secretary of 
the Interior. Dirk has an abiding love of nature and the outdoors and is 
dedicated to conserving our natural resources. He will continue my 
administration's efforts to effectively manage our national parks, 
support historic and cultural sites through our Preserve America 
Initiative, and pursue environmentally responsible energy development on 
Federal lands and waters. He will also work to

maintain good relations with Native American tribes and will play a 
leadership role in my cooperative conservation approach to environmental 
stewardship. I congratulate Dirk and his family on today's confirmation 
and thank him for his continued service to our Nation.
