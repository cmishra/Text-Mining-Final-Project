Statement on Senate Passage of Legislation To Reduce Federal Spending
November 3, 2005

    Today the Senate took an important step forward in cutting the 
deficit. I commend Senate leadership and the other Senators who 
supported this spending reduction legislation, and I congratulate 
Senator Gregg<Gregg, Judd A.<ls-thn-eq> on its successful passage. 
Congress needs to send me a spending reduction package this year to keep 
us on track to cutting the deficit in half by 2009.
