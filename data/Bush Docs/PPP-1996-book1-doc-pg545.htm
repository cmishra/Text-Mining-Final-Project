Remarks at a Tree Planting Ceremony Honoring Those Who Died in the 
Aircraft Tragedy in Croatia
April 5, 1996

    Last year, as we prepared to go to Oklahoma City, Hillary and I 
planted a dogwood tree here in honor of the public servants who lost 
their lives there. And this year as we prepare to go back, almost a year 
later, we are planting, sadly, another tree in honor of Secretary Brown 
and all the public servants of the United States and the citizens who 
lost their lives in the plane crash. We hope the prayers of the American 
people will be with them and their families at

this difficult time. We hope everyone will honor the contributions they 
made to the United States and the welfare of our people.

Note: The President spoke at 9:15 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House.
