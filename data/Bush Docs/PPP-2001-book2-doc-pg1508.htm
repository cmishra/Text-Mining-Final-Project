Statement on Representative Richard K. Armey's<Armey, Richard 
K.> Decision Not To Seek Reelection
December 12, 2001

    The country, the people of Texas, and the Congress have been well 
served by Congressman Dick Armey. As a fellow Texan, I know his 
effective leadership firsthand.
    When he was a sophomore lawmaker, and a member of the then minority 
party, Dick Armey proved his mettle by authoring and passing a major 
base closure initiative that was signed into law. As majority leader, he 
has skillfully guided legislation through Congress; his dedication to 
reforming Government, lowering taxes, and simplifying the tax system has 
deeply influenced public policy.
    I know Dick's dedication to public service will remain strong, even 
during his retirement. His sense of humor, candor, and leadership will 
be sorely missed in Congress.
    Laura and I extend our thanks to Dick, his wife, Susan,<Armey, 
Susan> and their family, and we wish each of them the best in 
the future.
