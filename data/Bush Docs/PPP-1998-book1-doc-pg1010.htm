    By virtue of the authority vested in me by 49 U.S.C. 40106(b), I

Lebanon established by Presidential Determination 85-14 of July 1, 1985, 
as amended by Presidential Determination 92-41 of August 17, 1992, is 
hereby further amended to permit U.S. air carriers to engage in foreign

passengers, including U.S. and non-U.S. citizens, and their accompanying 
baggage, to and from Lebanon and to permit U.S. and foreign air carriers 
to sell in the United States air transportation services for passengers, 
including U.S. and non-U.S. citizens, to and from Lebanon.
    All other prohibitions set forth in the above-referenced 
Presidential Determinations, including the prohibition on direct 
operations to Lebanon by U.S. air carriers, remain in effect.

to implement this determination immediately and to revoke effective 
immediately any regulations inconsistent herewith.
    You are further directed to publish this determination in the
