Statement on Proposed Maritime Security and Trade Legislation
March 10, 1994

    Today my administration is sending to the Congress the ``Maritime 
Security and Trade Act of 1994.'' This legislation represents an 
important step forward to assuring America's future as a maritime 
nation.
    A modern merchant United States flag fleet, with skilled U.S. 
mariners, will provide not only jobs and economic benefits but also an 
important sealift capability in times of national emergency. My 
administration's proposal calls for a $1 billion, 10-year program to 
revitalize the U.S. maritime industry. I look forward to working with 
the Congress to secure approval for this important legislation.
