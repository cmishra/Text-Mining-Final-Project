Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Sudan
November 1, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the Sudan emergency is to continue in effect beyond November 3, 2005. 
The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in the 
Federal Register on November 2, 2004 (69 FR 63915).
    The crisis between the United States and Sudan constituted by the 
actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on November 3, 1997, has not been 
resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests and 
pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, I have 
determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency 
declared with respect to Sudan and maintain in force comprehensive 
sanctions against Sudan to respond to this threat.

                                                          George W. Bush
