February 24, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to nominate John M. 
Deutch, a highly respected expert on military technology and current 
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, to serve as 
Deputy Secretary of Defense under Secretary William Perry.
    ``John Deutch is a sound and sophisticated adviser whose expertise 
on military technology and policy has served the Department of Defense 
well in his tenure as Under Secretary of Defense,'' the President said. 
``Secretary Perry and I will rely heavily on his knowledge, imagination, 
and judgment as we work to maintain the strongest military in the world 
at a time of budgetary constraints.''

Press Secretary.
