Memorandum on the White House Program for the National Moment of 
Remembrance
May 2, 2000

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject:  White House Program for the National Moment of Remembrance

    As Memorial Day approaches, it is time to pause and consider the 
true meaning of this holiday. Memorial Day represents one day of 
national awareness and reverence, honoring those Americans who died 
while defending our Nation and its values. While we should honor these 
heroes every day for the profound contribution they have made to 
securing our Nation's freedom, we should honor them especially on 
Memorial Day.

[[Page 819]]

    In this time of unprecedented success and prosperity throughout our 
land, I ask that all Americans come together to recognize how fortunate 
we are to live in freedom and to observe a universal ``National Moment 
of Remembrance'' on each Memorial Day. This memorial observance 
represents a simple and unifying way to commemorate our history and 
honor the struggle to protect our freedoms.
    Accordingly, I hereby direct all executive departments and agencies, 
in consultation with the White House Program for the National Moment of 
Remembrance (Program), to promote a ``National Moment of Remembrance'' 
to occur at 3 p.m. (local time) on each Memorial Day.
    Recognizing that Memorial Day is a Federal holiday, all executive 
departments and agencies, in coordination with the Program and to the 
extent possible and permitted by law, shall promote and provide 
resources to support a National Moment of Remembrance, including:
  <bullet>   Encouraging individual department and agency personnel, and 
            Americans everywhere, to pause for one minute at 3:00 p.m. 
            (local time) on Memorial Day, to remember and reflect on the 
            sacrifices made by so many to provide freedom for all.
  <bullet>   Recognizing, in conjunction with Memorial Day, department 
            and agency personnel whose family members have made the 
            ultimate sacrifice for this Nation.
  <bullet>   Providing such information and assistance as may be 
            necessary for the Program to carry out its functions.
    I have asked the Director of the White House Millennium Council to 
issue additional guidance, pursuant to this Memorandum, to the heads of 
executive departments and agencies regarding specific activities and 
events to commemorate the National Moment of Remembrance.

                                                      William J. Clinton

 Note:  This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on May 3.
