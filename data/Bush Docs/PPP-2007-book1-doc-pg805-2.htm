Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on the Faith-Based and Community 
Initiative
June 25, 2007

    Today's Supreme Court decision marks a substantial victory for 
efforts by Americans to more effectively aid our neighbors in need of 
help. The Faith-Based and Community Initiative can remain focused on 
strengthening America's armies of compassion and expanding their good 
works. Similar efforts by Governors and mayors in States and cities all 
across the country can also continue to advance.
    From the first days of my administration, we've championed the idea 
that those in need are better served when government draws on the 
strengths of every willing community partner--secular and faith-based, 
large and small. My administration has eliminated regulatory and policy 
barriers in the Federal Agencies, deliveredtraining and development to 
more than 50,000 social service entrepreneurs, and competitively awarded 
tens of thousands of Federal grants to faith-based and community 
organizations for service to others at home and abroad. These efforts 
fortify America's safety net and expand our Nation's supply of 
compassion.
    This ruling is a win for the thousands of community and faith-based 
nonprofits all across the country that have partnered with government at 
all levels to serve their neighbors. Most importantly, it is a win for 
the many whose lives have been lifted by the caring touch and 
compassionate hearts of these organizations.
