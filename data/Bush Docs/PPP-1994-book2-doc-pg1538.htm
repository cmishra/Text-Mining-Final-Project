Statement on the Nomination for Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic
September 12, 1994

    I will look to General Sheehan to continue the innovative efforts of 
Admiral Miller in defining the role of allied military power in forging 
a safe and secure world.

Note: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary 
announcing that the President nominated Gen. John J. Sheehan, USMC, to 
succeed Adm. Paul D. Miller as Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, and 
to serve as commander in chief, U.S. Atlantic Command.
