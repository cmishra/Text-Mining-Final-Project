Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting Budget Deferrals
October 18, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report seven deferrals of budget authority, 
totaling $3.5 billion.
    These deferrals affect International Security Assistance programs as 
well as programs of the Agency for International Development and the 
Departments of Health and Human Services and State. The details of these 
deferrals are contained in the attached report.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
The report detailing the deferrals was published in the  Federal 
Register on October 27.
