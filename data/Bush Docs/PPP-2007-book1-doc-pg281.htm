Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> of Colombia in Bogota, Colombia
March 11, 2007

    Mr. President, thank you very much. I appreciate your hospitality. I 
am amazed by the beauty of your country. I've never been here to the 
beautiful capital city of your country, but Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
and I were struck by two things: the beauty of the landscape and the 
warmness of the people.
    We--I bring greetings from the United States to the people of your 
country. We have been friends, and we shall remain friends. We value 
your democracy. I appreciate your strong leadership. We come during a 
period where your country has come through very difficult times, and now 
there's a brighter day ahead. And my message to the people of your 
country is, we want to help every individual realize their God-given 
potential.
    I'd like to propose a toast to the people of this country and to the 
leadership of this country. Que Dios les bendiga.

Note: The President spoke at 3 p.m. at Casa de Narino. The transcript 
released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks 
of President Uribe. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a 
Spanish language transcript of these remarks.
