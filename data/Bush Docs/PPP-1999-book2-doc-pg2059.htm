Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
November 10, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period August 1, 1999, to September 30, 
1999. The previous submission covered events during June and July 1999.
    In an official working visit to the United States, Turkish Prime 
Minister Ecevit and I had a productive meeting on September 28. We 
exchanged views on a number of topics, including Cyprus. I emphasized 
that reaching a just and lasting solution to the Cyprus dispute remains 
one of my highest priorities. The Prime Minister and I agreed that there 
cannot be a solution to the Cyprus problem that would return the

situation to what it was before 1974: all Cypriots must live in 
security. Prime Minister Ecevit<Ecevit, Bulent> supported my 
idea that my Special Emissary for Cyprus, Alfred H. Moses,<Moses, Alfred 
H.> travel to the region to explore ways to move forward on 
the Cyprus issue, in particular by starting comprehensive talks with no 
pre-condition under U.N. auspices, as called for by the G-8.
    The international community mourned the death of Greek Alternate 
Foreign Minister Kranidiotis.<Kranidiotis, Yannos> His passing 
is a true loss for Greece and Cyprus.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
