Memorandum on the Combined Federal Campaign
June 25, 1996

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: 1996 Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area

    I am delighted that the Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin 
has agreed to serve as the chair of the 1996 Combined Federal Campaign 
of the National Capital Area. I ask you to support the campaign by 
personally chairing it in your Agency and appointing a top official as 
your vice chair.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. This year our goal 
is to raise more than $38 million. Public servants not only contribute 
to the campaign, but assume leadership roles to ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help guarantee another 
successful campaign this year.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on June 26.
