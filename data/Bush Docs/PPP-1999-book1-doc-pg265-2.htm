Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting on the Deployment of United 
States Military Personnel to Kenya and Tanzania
February 25, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    On August 10, 1998, I reported to the Congress that two teams of 
U.S. military personnel had been deployed to Kenya and Tanzania to 
assist in the provision of security for our embassies in Nairobi and Dar 
es Salaam in the aftermath of the terrorist bombings at those sites. I 
am providing this supplemental report, consistent with the War Powers 
Resolution, as part of my efforts to keep the Congress informed about 
the continuing deployment of U.S. military personnel in Kenya.
    The military personnel that deployed to Tanzania have since 
redeployed. Military personnel have remained in Kenya, however, to 
assist in provision of security for our embassy and American citizens in 
Nairobi. The need for this additional security support will continue 
until renovations are completed to provide a secure and permanent 
embassy facility in Nairobi.
    I have continued this deployment of U.S. Armed Forces pursuant to my 
constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as 
Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. I appreciate the support of the 
Congress in this action to assist in embassy security and the security 
of American citizens overseas.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Strom Thurmond, President pro tempore of 
the Senate.
