Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
April 25, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through January 
31, 1995. The current report covers the period from February 1, 1995, 
through March 31, 1995.
    During this period my Special Emissary for Cyprus, Richard I. 
Beattie, and the State Department's Special Cyprus Coordinator, James A. 
Williams, visited Turkey and met with Turkish leaders. Constructive 
discussions were held on how best to move the process forward after the 
elections in northern Cyprus in April. Prime Minister Ciller expressed 
her willingness to assist in finding a solution during her recent visit 
and restated Ankara's commitment to work with the United Nations in 
producing an overall solution to the Cyprus problem.
    On March 6, the European Union agreed to begin accession 
negotiations with Cyprus after the conclusion of the 1996 
Intergovernmental Conference. On the same date, the European Union 
concluded a customs union agreement with Turkey. I believe talks on 
membership in the EU for the entire island of Cyprus, together with 
Turkey's integration into Europe, will serve as a catalyst to the search 
for an overall solution on Cyprus.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
