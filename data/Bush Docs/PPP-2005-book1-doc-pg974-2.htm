Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I thank the Ford's Theatre Society and 
to the producing director, Paul Tetreault.<Tetreault, Paul R.<ls-thn-eq>
    Since we moved to Washington, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
have been guests of Ford's Theatre a number of times, and we appreciate 
the vital work it is doing. As a working stage, Ford's Theatre provides 
an important venue for the arts right here in the heart of our Nation's 
Capital.
    I'm really grateful to the members of the Armed Services who 
participated in tonight's celebration. Our military is defending America 
and advancing the cause of freedom and peace around the world. We are 
privileged to be citizens of a country served by our brave troops, and 
we thank them for their service.
    We appreciate the military families who are with us tonight. It's 
not easy being left behind when a loved one goes to war. By loving and 
supporting a man or woman in uniform, our military families also serve 
our Nation, and America is grateful to all of them for their support and 
sacrifice.
    Once again, we thank all the entertainers and the supporters of the 
Ford's Theatre who have made this evening one to remember. May God bless 
you all, and may God continue to bless the United States.

Note: The President's remarks were videotaped at approximately 8:45 p.m. 
at Ford's Theatre for broadcast on July 4 on the ABC Television Network. 
In his remarks, he referred to entertainers Jeff Foxworthy, the 
Pendragons, and Julie Roberts. The transcript was released by the Office 
of the Press Secretary on June 13.
