Message on the Observance of Hanukkah, 1993
December 7, 1993

    I am pleased to send my warmest greetings to all who are celebrating 
Hanukkah.
    The Festival of Lights, a joyous holiday that commemorates a 
miracle, is a fitting time to give thanks for the blessings of the past 
year. One of those great blessings was the historic handshake between 
the Prime Minister of Israel and the Chairman of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization--something that surely would have seemed a 
miracle just a short time ago. Hanukkah serves as a reminder that faith 
and perseverance can sustain us against the most difficult odds.
    We live in a world weary of violence and determined to take steps to 
advance the cause of peace. We live in a nation that has made a renewed 
commitment to improving our communities and using our rich ethnic 
heritage to unite us, rather than to divide us. The strong beliefs and 
confidence that brought victory to the Maccabees and eight days of light 
to the Temple can guide us as we face the momentous challenges of our 
times. The eternal lesson of Hanukkah--that faith gives us the strength 
to work miracles and find light in times of darkness--inspires all of us 
to strive toward a brighter future.
    In this holiday season, let us rededicate ourselves to creating a 
more peaceful world for all.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
December 7.
