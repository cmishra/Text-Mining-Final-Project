Statement on the Situation in Zimbabwe
December 9, 2008

    As my administration has made clear, it is time for Robert 
Mugabe<Mugabe, Robert<ls-thn-eq> to go. Across the continent, African 
voices are bravely speaking out to say now is the time for him to step 
down. These leaders share the desire of ordinary Zimbabweans for a 
return to peace, democracy, and prosperity. We urge others from the 
region to step up and join the growing chorus of voices calling for an 
end to Mugabe's tyranny.
    The United States will continue to work with our partners around the 
world to halt the violence and stem the humanitarian disaster that the 
Mugabe<Mugabe, Robert<ls-thn-eq> regime is inflicting on its people. We 
stand ready to help rebuild Zimbabwe once a legitimate government has 
been formed that reflects the results of the March elections.
