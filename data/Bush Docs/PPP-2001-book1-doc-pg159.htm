touch. Then we will assess whatever damage, and we will provide whatever 
resources are necessary to help the people.
    Q. When were you told?
    The President. I was told in Omaha.
    Q. Do you have a message for the people of Washington?
    The President. Well, God bless, obviously. Anything we can do to 
help, we will do so.

as these.
