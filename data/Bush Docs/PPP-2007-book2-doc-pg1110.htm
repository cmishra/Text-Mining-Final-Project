Remarks Congratulating Iraqi Leaders at Kirtland Air Force Base, New 
Mexico
August 27, 2007

    I congratulate Iraq's leaders on the agreement reached yesterday in 
Baghdad. I've been briefed on the agreement, and this morning I spoke to 
Iraq's elected leaders. These leaders represent all the Iraqi 
communities. These leaders of Prime Minister Maliki,<Maliki, Nuri al-
<ls-thn-eq> President Talabani,<Talabani, Jalal<ls-thn-eq> Vice 
President Hashimi,<Hashimi, Tariq al-<ls-thn-eq> Vice President Abd Al-
Mahdi,<Abd Al-Mahdi, Adil<ls-thn-eq> President<Barzani, 
Masoud<ls-thn-eq> Barzani recognize the true and meaningful 
reconciliation that needs to take place, and they recognize this is a 
process. Yesterday's agreement reflects their commitment to work 
together for the benefit of all Iraqis to further the process.
    The agreement begins to establish new power-sharing agreements and 
commits to supporting bottom-up security and political initiatives and 
advances agreement among Iraq's leadership on several key legislative 
benchmarks.
    While yesterday's agreement is an important step, I reminded them, 
and they understand, much more needs to be done. The Iraqi parliament 
will convene again in early September, and it will need to act to codify 
this political progress.
    It's in our interests that we help the Iraqi people succeed. Success 
in Iraq will be a major blow to the extremists and radicals who would 
like to attack America again. And that's why the United States will 
continue to support Iraq's leaders and all the Iraqi people in their 
efforts to overcome the forces of terror that seek to overthrow a 
nascent democracy.
    In this regard, I welcome and accept the expressed desire of the 
Iraqi leadership to develop a long-term relationship with the United 
States based on common interests. The United States is committed to 
developing this relationship and to strengthening diplomatic, economic, 
and security ties with the Iraqi Government and its people.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:33 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, President Jalal Talabani, and Vice 
Presidents Tariq al-Hashimi and Adil Abd Al-Mahdi of Iraq; and Masoud 
Barzani, president, Kurdistan region in Iraq. The Office of the Press 
Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of these remarks.
