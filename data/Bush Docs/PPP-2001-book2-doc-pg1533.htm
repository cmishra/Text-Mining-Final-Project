Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Economic Stimulus 
Package
December 20, 2001

    I commend the House of Representatives for its leadership in passing 
an economic security package that will help workers and get our economy 
growing. This bipartisan plan will help ensure that workers have access 
to health care and unemployment benefits, that new jobs will be created, 
and that people will have more money in their

pockets. For the sake of America's workers, I call on the Senate to act 
now on this plan, which can pass the Senate with a bipartisan majority 
if it is brought up for a vote. If this bipartisan bill gets to my desk, 
I will sign it.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
