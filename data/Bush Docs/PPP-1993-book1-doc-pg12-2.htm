Statement on the Death of Justice Thurgood Marshall
January 24, 1993

    I am deeply saddened by the passing of Justice Thurgood Marshall. He 
was a giant in the quest for human rights and equal opportunity in this 
century. Every American should be grateful for the contributions he made 
as an advocate and Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

Note: The related proclamation is listed in Appendix D at the end of 
this volume.
