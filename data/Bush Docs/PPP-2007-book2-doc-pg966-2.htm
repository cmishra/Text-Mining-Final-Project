Remarks Following a Briefing By Provincial Reconstruction Team Leaders 
and Brigade Combat Commanders
July 13, 2007

    As part of our strategy to succeed in Iraq, I not only reinforced 
our military efforts with more troops, we also surged civilians to work 
with our military to help the reconciliation efforts in a country that 
is still recovering from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein.
    And today my Security Council here had a opportunity not only to 
speak with our Ambassador in Iraq<Crocker, Ryan C.<ls-thn-eq> but also 
five members of Provincial Reconstruction Teams, three civilians and two 
military--colonels. They have briefed us on the grassroots effort to 
improve services, to improve the economy,

to encourage local government, all aiming at enhancing this concept of 
reconciliation from the bottom up.
    We heard from the PRT leader in Anbar.<Soriano, James<ls-thn-eq> I 
had the honor of speaking to him months ago, and now he has briefed us 
on the progress that he has seen. Listen, there is still a lot of work 
to be done. But these people at the grassroots understand that most 
Iraqis want to live in peace and that, with time, we'll be able to help 
them realize that dream.
    And so I want to thank you once again for your outstanding service 
to our Nation in the cause of peace. What happens in Iraq matters to the 
United States of America. A violent, chaotic Iraq will affect our 
security at home. An Iraq that can self-govern, provide basic services 
to its people, and be an ally in the war on terror will mean that all of 
us have accepted a great challenge and laid a foundation of peace for 
our children and grandchildren.
    And so thank you for your service. I appreciate your--I want to 
thank your families who are supporting you in this just and noble cause. 
And may God bless you all. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:30 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan 
C. Crocker.
