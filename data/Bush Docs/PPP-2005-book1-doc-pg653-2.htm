Remarks on the Nomination of General Peter Pace<Pace, Peter<ls-thn-eq> 
To Be Chairman and Admiral Edmund P. Giambastiani, Jr.,<Giambastiani, 
Edmund P., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> To Be Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff
April 22, 2005

    The President. Good morning. As President, my most solemn duty is 
protecting the American people. In meeting this responsibility, one of 
the most important decisions I make is the appointment of the Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Today I'm pleased to announce my decision 
to nominate General Peter Pace to take on this vital job.
    When confirmed by the Senate, General Pete Pace will be the first 
marine in history to hold this vital position. He knows the job well. 
For the past 3\1/2\ years, he has served under our superb Secretary of 
Defense, Don Rumsfeld.<Rumsfeld, Donald H.<ls-thn-eq> He has been the 
Deputy to one of the most outstanding Chairmen our Nation has ever had, 
General Richard Myers.<Myers, Richard B.<ls-thn-eq>
    As my most senior military adviser, General Myers<Myers, Richard 
B.<ls-thn-eq> has helped prepare military forces so they can meet the 
threats of this new century. This is a huge task, even in peacetime. 
Dick Myers did it while defending America from one of the most 
determined and vicious enemies we have ever faced. On General Myers's 
watch, we toppled two brutal dictatorships in Afghanistan and Iraq and 
liberated more than 50 million people. By removing the Taliban and 
Saddam Hussein,<Hussein, Saddam<ls-thn-eq> we have made America safer 
and put a troubled region on the path to freedom and peace.
    I want to thank General Dick Myers<Myers, Richard B.<ls-thn-eq> for 
his able service over four decades and his tireless dedication to duty 
and country. And I also thank his wife, Mary Jo.<Myers, Mary 
Jo<ls-thn-eq> Dick Myers has had four jobs with four stars, but the 
distinction that he is proudest of is not a military one. Last year, the 
National Father's Day Council named him Father of the Year.
    I'm confident that the great work that General Dick Myers<Myers, 
Richard B.<ls-thn-eq> set in motion at the Pentagon will continue under 
the leadership of General Pete Pace. The first thing America needs to 
know about Pete Pace is that he is a marine. To the American people, 
marine is shorthand for ``can do.'' And I'm counting on Pete Pace to 
bring the Marine spirit to these new responsibilities.
    General Pete Pace's life is the story of the American Dream. His 
father was an immigrant from Italy. Pete Pace was born in Brooklyn. He 
grew up in New Jersey, and he graduated from the U.S. Naval

Academy. He was a rifle platoon leader in Vietnam. He commanded marines 
in Somalia, and he went on to command U.S. Marine forces in the Atlantic 
and became the head of the U.S. Southern Command. It tells you something 
about Pete Pace's devotion to his troops that under the glass on his 
desk at the Pentagon, he keeps a photo of Lance Corporal Guido Farinaro. 
He was the first marine he lost in combat in Vietnam.
    I've come to rely on Pete Pace's wisdom, judgment, and sense of 
humor. I will continue to rely on those qualities as he serves our 
Nation as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We'll need his wisdom 
and determination as we continue to transform our Armed Forces so we can 
defeat today's enemies while preparing ourselves for military challenges 
we will face as this new century unfolds.
    General Pete Pace also understands the critical role military 
families play in the success of our Armed Forces. That's because he has 
a great military family himself. I'm pleased to welcome his wife, 
Lynne,<Pace, Lynne<ls-thn-eq> and daughter, Tiffany,<Pace, Tiffany 
M.<ls-thn-eq> who have joined us today. They're proud of Pete, and they 
should be.
    Because he has served in the job, General Pete Pace also understands 
the important role that the Vice Chairman plays. Today I am pleased to 
announce that I have nominated an outstanding military officer, Admiral 
Ed Giambastiani. [Laughter] He shall be known as Admiral G. [Laughter] 
Anyway, he's going to be the Vice Chairman. [Laughter]
    For the past 2\1/2\ years, Admiral G, as his friends and now the 
President calls him--[laughter]--has been serving our Nation while 
wearing two important hats. As Commander of the U.S. Joint Forces 
Command in Norfolk, he has been transforming our Armed Forces so they 
can better work together to defeat the threats of the 21st century. As 
the first Supreme Allied Commander for Transformation, he's been leading 
the effort to bring reform to NATO military so our Alliance is prepared 
for the threats of tomorrow.
    Admiral G is joined today by his wife, Cindy,<Giambastiani, 
Cindy<ls-thn-eq> daughter, Cathy,<Giambastiani, Cathy<ls-thn-eq> and his 
son, Pete,<Giambastiani, Peter<ls-thn-eq> a Navy lieutenant, and Pete's 
wife, Jennifer.<Giambastiani, Jennifer<ls-thn-eq>
    I appreciate the willingness of these men and their families to take 
on these new assignments in an extraordinary moment in our Nation's 
history. We still face ruthless adversaries who wish to attack our 
country. With the leadership of men like these, the outcome of the 
struggle is assured: America will defeat freedom's enemies and ensure 
the security of our country for generations to come.
    It's my honor to bring to the podium General Pete Pace.

[At this point, Chairman-designate Pace made brief remarks.]

    The President. Thanks for bailing me out. [Laughter]

[Chairman-designate Pace continued his remarks, and then Vice Chairman-
designate Giambastiani made brief remarks.]

    The President. Thank you all for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 10:12 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to former President Saddam 
Hussein of Iraq. The transcript released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary also included the remarks of Chairman-designate Pace and Vice 
Chairman-designate Giambastiani.
