Statement on Additional California Earthquake Assistance
August 2, 1994

    Years after natural disasters struck the Bay area and south Florida, 
ghost towns remain and local communities continue to suffer. We are 
working today to overcome those problems, when they have become far more 
difficult and expensive to address. In Los Angeles and Santa Monica, we 
are proposing to begin the restoration of these ghost towns now, before 
it is too late.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
that the President requested additional fiscal year 1994 funds for the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development for the repair and 
reconstruction of housing damaged by the southern California earthquake 
earlier this year.
