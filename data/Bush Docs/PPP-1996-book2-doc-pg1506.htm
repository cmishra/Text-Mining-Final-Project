Statement on the Death of Arthur Flemming
September 8, 1996

    Arthur Flemming was a close friend to me and the First Lady. He was 
a wonderful human being and great public servant who thought of nothing 
more than the health and well being of his fellow Americans. He 
transcended party, generation, and race in search of consensus on some 
of the great issues of our day. The First Lady and I, and the country, 
will greatly miss him.
