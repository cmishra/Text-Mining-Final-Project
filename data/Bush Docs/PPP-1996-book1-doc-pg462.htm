Statement on Signing the Tenth Continuing Resolution
March 15, 1996

    Today, I have signed into law H.J. Res. 163, the Tenth Continuing 
Resolution for fiscal 1996.
    H.J. Res. 163 provides for a temporary extension of appropriations--
March 16th through March 22nd--for activities funded in four of the five 
appropriations bills that have not been enacted into law. The District 
of Columbia receives no new Federal funds, but retains authority to use 
local funds.
    It is regrettable that I must sign yet another continuing 
resolution. However, Congress still has not passed five of this year's 
thirteen appropriations bills in acceptable form, so this measure is 
necessary to prevent a third government shutdown.
    We are now nearly halfway through the fiscal year. Continuing 
uncertainty over funding levels and authorities has impaired the ability 
of our Federal agencies and State and local governments to provide 
critical services to the public.
    I urge Congress to meet its responsibilities by sending me 
legislation for the remaining fiscal 1996 appropriations bills in an 
acceptable form. I have made it clear to the Congress what changes need 
to be made to make them acceptable.
    The purpose of those changes is to ensure, as we work to balance the 
budget and control discretionary spending, that we protect our nation's 
investments in education, the environment, law enforcement, and 
technology.
    Unfortunately, while the Senate has made improvements, the current 
House and Senate versions of an omnibus appropriations bill for the 
remainder of the year still do not protect these national priorities. 
Moreover, they contain harmful and unacceptable legislative riders 
affecting the environment and other issues.
    We have a responsibility to the American people to act together to 
resolve our differences. I am committed to doing so. I urge the Congress 
to act quickly to enact acceptable appropriations legislation for the 
remainder of the fiscal year.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

March 15, 1996.

Note: H.J. Res. 163, approved March 15, was assigned Public Law No. 104-
116.
