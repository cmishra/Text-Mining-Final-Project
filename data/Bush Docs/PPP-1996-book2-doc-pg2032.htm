Statement on the Tentative Agreement Between the United Auto Workers and 
General Motors
November 2, 1996

    I congratulate and applaud the United Auto Workers and General 
Motors for putting in the intense effort and long hours that led to this 
tentative agreement. Their hard work and ultimate success are a tribute 
to our system of collective bargaining. They have proven once again that 
when labor and management work together, they make our businesses, our 
working families, and our economy stronger. I am very hopeful that the 
tentative agreement will be ratified and that the outstanding local 
issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work.
