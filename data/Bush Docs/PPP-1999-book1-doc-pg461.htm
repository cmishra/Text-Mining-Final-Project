Statement on the Rescue of a United States Pilot in Serbia
March 27, 1999

    I am pleased with the news that our pilot has been rescued 
successfully. I am tremendously proud of the skill and bravery of the 
pilot and of the courageous individuals who participated in the 
recovery.
    As I have said from the outset, this military operation entails real 
risk. However, the continued brutality and repression of the Serb forces 
further underscores the necessity for NATO forces to persevere.
    Our NATO operations will go forward as planned. I strongly support 
the decision of Secretary General Solana<Solana, Javier> to 
move to a new phase of the air campaign, which will include a wider 
range of targets, including forces in the field.
