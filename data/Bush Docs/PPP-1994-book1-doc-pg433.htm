Statement on House of Representatives Action on Budget Legislation
March 11, 1994

    I commend the House for passing our budget. This budget continues to 
bring down the deficit and makes needed investments in our people and in 
our economy. Our commitment to fiscal discipline and targeted 
investments is paying off in strong economic growth and job creation. 
Working together, the Congress and this administration are building a 
stronger economy for today and a future of opportunity for our children.
