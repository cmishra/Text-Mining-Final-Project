Nomination for the Small Business Administration
September 23, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Philip Lader 
as Administrator of the Small Business Administration. He also announced 
that he would make the SBA Administrator a member of his Cabinet, 
effective when Mr. Lader takes office. The SBA Administrator is also a 
member of the National Economic Council.
    ``Phil is a great manager and motivator, and he knows business,'' 
the President said. ``His extensive private sector experience as well as 
his work at OMB and in the White House make him an ideal candidate to 
head the SBA. Erskine Bowles turned SBA around after years of neglect. 
Phil is going to make it even better.''
    ``I think it's well known how much I respect Phil Lader. My 
selection of Erskine Bowles and now Phil Lader for this job reflects my 
firm commitment to a strong SBA. This appointment and the elevation of 
the SBA Administrator to Cabinet status reflect my equally firm 
commitment to address the interests and concerns of our Nation's small 
business community.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
