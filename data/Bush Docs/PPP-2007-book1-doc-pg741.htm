Statement on the Bombing of the Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra, Iraq
June 13, 2007

    I condemn in the strongest terms today's terrorist attack on the Al-
Askari Mosque in Samarra. This barbarous act was clearly aimed at 
inflaming sectarian tensions among the peoples of Iraq and defeating 
their aspirations for a secure, democratic, and prosperous country. I 
join Iraq's leaders in calling on all Iraqis to refrain from acts of 
vengeance and reject Al Qaida's scheme to sow hatred among the Iraqi 
people and to instead join together in fighting Al Qaida as the true 
enemy of a free and secure Iraq.
    At the Prime Minister's<Maliki, Nuri al- <ls-thn-eq> request, the 
coalition has dispatched a rapid reaction force to Samarra to assist 
Iraqi forces in guarding the mosque and restoring calm and security to 
the area. The United States also stands ready to help the Iraqi people 
rebuild and restore this holy shrine. I call upon the international 
community and Iraq's neighbors to do everything in their power to help 
Iraq's Government and people combat the terrorists, especially in 
stopping the flow of foreign terrorists into Iraq. Those responsible for 
this outrage must be found and brought to justice. The United States 
stands by the Iraqi people in this difficult moment and remains fully 
committed to helping all Iraqis realize their dreams of a peaceful 
future.

Note: The statement referred to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of Iraq.
