Statement on the 10th Anniversary of the Terrorist Attack on the Khobar 
Towers in Saudi Arabia
June 26, 2006

    Ten years ago yesterday, in an attack on the Khobar Towers apartment 
complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, 19 members of our Armed Forces were 
killed and hundreds of other Americans were injured by terrorists who we 
believe were working with Iranian officials. We honor the courage of 
those who paid the ultimate price in defending our country. America will 
carry on the legacy of these fallen heroes by continuing the mission for 
which they gave their lives: defeating tyranny, defending freedom, and 
protecting their fellow citizens.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I offer our prayers and the 
gratitude of this great Nation to the families who lost loved ones in 
that brutal attack. These families can know that their loved ones will 
always be remembered and that we will remain determined in our efforts 
to bring to justice those responsible for this attack.
    In remembrance of those who lost their lives 10 years ago, I ask 
Americans to keep their families in your hearts and your prayers.
