Statement on Senator Christopher S. ``Kit'' Bond's<Bond, Christopher S. 
``Kit''<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not To Seek Reelection
January 8, 2009

    Senator Kit Bond has been a wonderful public servant and statesman 
for the people of Missouri. During more than three decades of service as 
Governor and United States Senator, Kit has been a tireless advocate for 
our children, our military, and our Nation's intelligence community. He 
played a vital role in the effort to modernize the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act. Because of his leadership, we are protecting the 
liberties of our citizens while gathering vital information we need to 
prevent attacks on our soil.
    I have been honored to work with Senator Bond during my time as 
President, and Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish Kit, Linda,<Bond, 
Linda<ls-thn-eq> and their son Samuel<Bond, Samuel<ls-thn-eq> all the 
best in the future.
