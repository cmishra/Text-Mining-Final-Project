Statement on the Death of Lewis Puller
May 12, 1994

    I am saddened by the death of my friend Lewis Puller, who served his 
country with honor and distinction. As the son of America's most 
decorated Marine veteran of World War II and a winner of the Pulitzer 
Prize for his moving story of his personal struggle, ``Fortunate Son,'' 
Lewis Puller was a true American hero. His death reminds us all of the 
grief that still haunts so many of America's veterans today, of the 
wounds that never heal, and the loved ones left behind.
    My most memorable moment with Lewis was on Memorial Day a year ago 
at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, when he appeared at that ceremony 
unexpectedly and wheeled himself up next to me on the platform. I want 
his wife, Toddy, and his children, Lewis and Maggie, to know that it was 
an honor for me to be by his side on that day, and as Memorial Day 
approaches again, Lewis will hold a special place in my thoughts and 
prayers.
