Statement on the Death of Larry Doby<Doby, Larry> 
June 20, 2003

    Larry Doby was a good and honorable man and a tremendous athlete and 
manager. He had a profound influence on the game of baseball, and he 
will be missed. As the first African American player in the American 
League, he helped lead the Cleveland Indians to their last World Series 
title in 1948, became a nine-time All-Star, and was voted into the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998. Laura<Bush, Laura> joins me in 
sending our condolences to Larry's family during this difficult time.
