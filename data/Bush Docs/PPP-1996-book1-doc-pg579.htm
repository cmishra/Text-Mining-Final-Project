Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting Proposed Budget Rescissions

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report 10 proposed rescissions of budgetary 
resources, totaling $400.4 million. These rescission proposals affect 
the Department of Defense.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
report detailing the proposed rescissions was published in the Federal 
Register on April 23.
