Statement on Action To Fight Global Climate Change
September 27, 1999

    I commend the hundreds of mayors and other local officials across 
the country who today are committing themselves to the fight against 
global climate change. The communities they represent understand that 
the threat of global warming is real. They also understand that we can 
begin to address this threat through actions that both help our 
environment and save money for taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. 
Today's pledge will help encourage other communities across American to 
do their part to meet this global challenge.
    Regrettably, even as ordinary citizens, local leaders, and a growing 
number of leading corporations are taking action, many in Congress are 
ignoring the mounting evidence of global warming and thwarting 
commonsense efforts to address it. I urge Congress to fully fund my 
proposed package of investments to accelerate the deployment of clean 
energy technologies for the 21st century including the proposed clean 
air partnership fund, which will provide grants to State and local 
governments for projects that reduce both greenhouse gases and 
pollutants like soot, smog, and air toxics. Finally, I call on Congress 
to withdraw all appropriations riders aimed at strangling programs that 
save energy, save consumers and businesses money, and reduce global 
warming pollution.
    I look forward to working with local leaders to meet this pressing 
environmental challenge, and I applaud their leadership and dedication.
