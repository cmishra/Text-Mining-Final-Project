Statement on Terrorist Attacks in Najaf, Iraq
August 11, 2006

    The terrorists in Iraq have again proven that they are enemies of 
all humanity. Yesterday they targeted innocent civilians in Najaf near a 
holy Muslim shrine and a symbol of peace throughout the world.
    According to Iraqi officials, the terrorist who committed this 
atrocity was stopped by Iraqi police before he could enter the holy 
shrine. These police officers were killed in the attack. They died for 
their country and for the cause of freedom, and we honor their 
dedication and bravery. We also mourn the loss of every innocent life in 
this atrocity and other atrocities perpetrated in Iraq in recent months.
    On behalf of the American people, I join Iraqi leaders of all 
communities who have condemned this barbarous action in the strongest 
possible terms. To the Iraqi people, I pledge the commitment of the 
United States to helping your new Government bring peace and security to 
all areas of your country.
