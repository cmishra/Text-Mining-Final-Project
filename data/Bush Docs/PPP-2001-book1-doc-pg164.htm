Remarks in Little Rock, Arkansas, on the Earthquake in Washington State
February 28, 2001

    I want to say something about what's taken place in Seattle today. I 
send my prayers and express our country's concern for our fellow 
citizens in Seattle, Tacoma, and Olympia--areas of the State of 
Washington. Those folks were affected by a major earthquake today. Our 
prayers are with those who were injured and their families, and with the 
many thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted.
    Thousands of people in Washington are without power or phone 
service. Airports are closed, and many buildings have sustained 
structural damage. My administration stands ready to help in any way we 
can. I've asked the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
Joe Allbaugh,<Allbaugh, Joe M.<ls-thn-eq> to travel to Seattle to offer 
our assistance. He is on his way in a couple of hours, and he'll be 
traveling with members of the--Washington State's congressional 
delegation.
    I've talked to Director Allbaugh.<Allbaugh, Joe M.<ls-thn-eq> He 
told me he felt like Senator Murray<Murray, Patty<ls-thn-eq> would be 
going. And they're reaching out to other members of the congressional 
delegation to travel with him. We will work with State and local 
officials to provide whatever help we can to the people of the State of 
Washington.

Note: The President spoke at 5:20 p.m. at Adams Field airport.
