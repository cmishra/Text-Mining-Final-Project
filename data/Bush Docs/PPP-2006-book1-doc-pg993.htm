Statement on the Death of Lee Jong-wook<Lee Jong-wook<ls-thn-eq>
May 22, 2006

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I were saddened to learn of the 
death of Dr. Lee Jong-wook. As the world's top health official, Dr. Lee 
worked tirelessly to improve the health of millions of people, from 
combating tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS to his aggressive efforts to 
eradicate polio. He provided tremendous leadership to the international 
community as it confronted the challenges of the 21st century, including 
the threat of an influenza pandemic. Dr. Lee's outreach to world leaders 
and entities increased awareness of potentially devastating public 
health dangers. We send our deepest condolences to his family.
