Statement on the Anniversary of the Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin
October 21, 1999

    Four years ago today, according to the Hebrew calendar, Yitzhak 
Rabin was murdered by an assassin in Tel Aviv. He was a Prime Minister, 
a general, a diplomat, and a courageous soldier in the battle for peace. 
All of us who were his friends still mourn his death.
    Twelve days from now, world leaders will gather in Oslo to honor 
Yitzhak Rabin's memory. I will attend on behalf of the American people. 
It was in Oslo, 6 years ago, that Israelis and Palestinians made the 
crucial decision to try to work together to achieve peace. Now, Prime 
Minister Barak<Barak, Ehud>, Chairman Arafat,<Arafat, 
Yasser> and I will come together in Oslo to build on that 
legacy and move closer to Rabin's goal: a permanent peace between Israel 
and the Palestinian people.
    There is much hard work ahead, with difficult decisions for all 
sides. But as we look back in sorrow to mourn the passing of a great 
man, we must do everything in our power on behalf of the cause to which 
he gave his life.
