Statement on the Death of Ambassador M. Larry Lawrence
January 9, 1996

    I was deeply saddened to learn of the death today of our Ambassador 
to Switzerland, M. Larry Lawrence. Larry was a good friend and a valued 
colleague who brought his abundant energy and fresh vision to every task 
he undertook. As Ambassador in Switzerland, he was a tireless and 
effective advocate of U.S. interests, especially the promotion of U.S. 
exports and commercial ties. Larry's service to his country did not 
begin with his diplomatic assignment. During World War II, at the age of 
18, he volunteered for the merchant marines. He was wounded when his 
ship was sunk by enemy torpedoes in arctic waters. Many years later, 
Larry was decorated with the Medal of Valor by the Government of the 
Russian Federation.
    Larry's civilian life showed the same courage and resolve. As an 
entrepreneur, he restored the Hotel del Coronado, one of the west 
coast's outstanding architectural landmarks. Larry's quiet philanthropy 
also touched many lives. He believed passionately in education for 
women; the scholarships he endowed for minority women at the University 
of Arizona represent a lasting contribution. Hillary joins me in 
expressing our deepest sympathy to Larry's wife, Shelia, and to his 
children. We will miss him.
