Statement Urging Senate Action on the Economic Security Package
December 7, 2001

    Today's unemployment numbers are troubling, and they underscore that 
we must act to ensure America's economic security. The most important 
thing we can do for unemployed workers and those who are concerned about 
their jobs is to get the economy growing. The Senate has not acted on 
the economic security package I proposed in October, and since then, 
over three-quarters of a million Americans have lost their jobs. Today's 
important economic warning demonstrates that American workers have 
already waited too long, so I urge the Senate to take immediate action 
to help workers and our economy.
