Statement on the Death of Tammy Wynette<Wynette, Tammy<ls-thn-eq>
April 7, 1998

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the untimely death of 
Tammy Wynette. For more than 30 years, Tammy Wynette defined the 
Nashville sound that helped to make American country western music 
popular all over the world. Her string of number one hits has* filled 
music halls, homes, and radio waves, and her trademark style has* filled 
our hearts and made her a legend. From the Mississippi cotton fields 
where she worked as a child, to the stage of the Grand Ole Opry where 
she presided as the First Lady of country music, Tammy Wynette was an 
American original, and we will miss her.
