Statement on Compensation and Benefits for Filipino Veterans
July 27, 2000

    Today I am directing the Department of Veterans Affairs to produce a 
study on the needs of Filipino veterans who served with the U.S. Armed 
Forces during World War II. I have asked that the study provide specific 
options on how our Veterans Affairs' health care system can address the 
needs of these Filipino veterans now living in the United States.
    During World War II, Filipino nationals were called into military 
service by Executive order of the President and fought valiantly under 
U.S. command to help achieve peace and freedom in the Pacific. After the 
war, the United States made grants to the Philippine Government to 
provide for the needs of these veterans. In addition, some are eligible 
for benefits under the United States veterans system. However, many of 
these deserving veterans living in the United States are currently not 
eligible for such benefits.
    For several years, my administration has worked with Members of 
Congress such as Representatives Bob Filner<Filner, Bob> and 
Patsy Mink<Mink, Patsy T.> to recognize the contributions of 
Filipino veterans and to improve the compensation and benefits of those 
living in the United States. As this population ages, it has a growing 
need for quality health care. That is why I am asking the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to look at ways we can address their needs. I look 
forward to the Department's recommendations. I am eager to find a way to 
fulfill the needs of this deserving group of veterans.
