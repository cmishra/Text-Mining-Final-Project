Statement on Signing the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living 
Adjustment Act of 1995
November 22, 1995

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2394, the ``Veterans' Compensation 
Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 1995.''
    In signing H.R. 2394, I am pleased to extend a most deserved benefit 
to our Nation's service-disabled veterans and the surviving spouses and 
children of those who made the supreme sacrifice in defense of our 
freedom. In acting to maintain the value of these payments, we keep 
faith with those who have given so much in service to us all.
    The Act provides a 2.6 percent increase in compensation and 
dependency and indemnity compensation benefits, effective December 1, 
1995. This is the same percentage increase that Social Security 
beneficiaries and veterans' pension recipients will be receiving in 
January.
    On Veterans Day, we paused to salute all men and women in uniform. 
Today, it is altogether fitting that we give tangible expression to our 
enduring commitment to honor our obligations to them.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

November 22, 1995.

Note: H.R. 2394, approved November 22, was assigned Public Law No. 104-
57. This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
November 27.
