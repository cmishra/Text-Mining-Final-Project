Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Strengthening America's

    The U.S. shipbuilding industry is unsurpassed in building the finest 
and most complex naval vessels in the world. Now that the Cold War has 
ended, these shipyards, like many other defense firms, face a new 
challenge--translating their skills from the military to the commercial

The enclosed report describes steps that the Government is taking and 
will take to assist their efforts. I look forward to working with the 
Congress and the industry to ensure a successful transition to a 
competitive industry in a truly competitive marketplace.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
October 1, 1993.
