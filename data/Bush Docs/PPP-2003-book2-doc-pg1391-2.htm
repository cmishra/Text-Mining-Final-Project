Statement on the Death of Madame Chiang Kai-shek<Madame Chiang Kai-
shek<ls-thn-eq>
October 24, 2003

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I were saddened to learn of the 
death of Madame Chiang Kai-shek. Madame Chiang was a close friend of the 
United States throughout her life and especially during the defining 
struggles of the last century. Generations of Americans will always 
remember and respect her intelligence and strength of character. On 
behalf of the American people, I extend condolences to Madame Chiang's 
family members and many admirers around the world.
