Statement on Senate Confirmation of James B. Peake<Peake, James 
B.<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of Veterans Affairs
December 14, 2007

    I am pleased that the Senate unanimously confirmed Dr. James Peake 
to serve as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Dr. Peake is a decorated 
veteran, highly skilled physician, and proven leader who has devoted his 
career to serving America's men and women in uniform. His decades of 
expertise in combat medicine and health care management have provided 
him with a thorough understanding of the Department's responsibility to 
care for America's veterans.
    One of his first tasks as Secretary will be to ensure that my 
administration continues to swiftly implement the recommendations of 
the<Dole, Robert J.<ls-thn-eq> Dole-Shalala<Shalala, Donna E.<ls-thn-eq> 
Commission on Wounded Warriors. I am confident that he will build upon 
our record of improving care, reducing bureaucracy, and ensuring that 
our veterans receive the benefits they deserve.

Note: The statement referred to former Sen. Robert J. Dole and former 
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E. Shalala, Cochairs, 
President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors.
