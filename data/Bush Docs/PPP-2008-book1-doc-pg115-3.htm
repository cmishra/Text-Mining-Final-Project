Statement on Signing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2008
January 28, 2008

    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 4986, the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. The Act authorizes funding for 
the defense of the United States and its interests abroad, for military 
construction, and for national security-related energy programs.
    Provisions of the Act, including sections 841, 846, 1079, and 1222, 
purport to impose requirements that could inhibit the President's 
ability to carry out his constitutional obligations to take care that 
the laws be faithfully executed, to protect national security, to 
supervise the executive branch, and to execute his authority as 
Commander in Chief. The executive branch shall construe such provisions 
in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the 
President.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,
