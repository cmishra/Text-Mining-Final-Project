Statement on the Accord on a New Railroad Station for New York City
March 4, 1998

    Last October, at the request of Senator Moynihan,<Moynihan, Daniel 
Patrick<ls-thn-eq> the White House began meetings with the Department of 
Transportation, the U.S. Postal Service, the General Services 
Administration, Amtrak, the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment 
Corporation, and local officials to find a way to designate the James 
Farley Post Office Building in New York City as the new home for Penn 
Station.
    Today I am happy to announce that an accord has been reached on Penn 
Station and plans to restore the James Farley Post Office Building are 
now underway. I applaud Senator Moynihan's<Moynihan, Daniel 
Patrick<ls-thn-eq> leadership and those involved in creating this 
magnificent opportunity.
    In 1993, I asked Congress to act on a vision to build a new, 
beautiful railroad station in Manhattan worthy of the future and worthy 
of New York City. Today that vision has become a reality.
