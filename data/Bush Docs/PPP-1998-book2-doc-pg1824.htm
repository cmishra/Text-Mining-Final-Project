Statement on the Death of Chris Georges
October 20, 1998

    Chris Georges was a reporter's reporter. Whether he was writing 
about the budget, Medicare, or welfare, Chris' journalistic integrity, 
attention to detail, and focus on the human side of policy earned him 
the respect of both his fellow reporters and those who work in the 
Congress and the White House. It was only fitting that his nomination 
for a Pulitzer Prize was for a story about welfare and HIV-positive 
children. Chris' friends and colleagues most remember his decency, 
integrity, wit, and sense of fairness. He will be deeply missed by his 
parents, sisters, and many friends.
