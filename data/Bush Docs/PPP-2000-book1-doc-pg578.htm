Statement on House Action on Supplemental Appropriations Legislation
March 30, 2000

    I am pleased that the House of Representatives today took action 
that would meet many of the essential, immediate needs in my 
supplemental budget request, including helping victims of Hurricane 
Floyd, providing energy assistance for families struggling with rising 
oil prices, helping keep illegal drugs out of our country by supporting 
the Colombian Government's fight against drug traffickers, and providing 
for our troops in Kosovo.
    It is vital that Congress avoid delay in meeting these needs; the 
costs of delay are great. A delay in Kosovo funding would soon 
jeopardize our current level of military readiness around the world and 
our ability to help the people of Kosovo build peace and a better 
future. A delay in support for Colombia's antidrug efforts would signal 
that Colombia lacks the international support to prevail against drug 
traffickers. At home, delaying funding for the victims of Hurricane 
Floyd would leave thousands in temporary housing possibly through their 
second winter and without funding to replenish the program for home 
energy assistance. A delay in LIHEAP funds would leave many Americans, 
especially the elderly and infirm, vulnerable in the event of an extreme 
heat wave this summer.
    The bill produced by the House today, while meeting essential needs, 
is also flawed. The House bill is too large--providing unnecessary 
funding for certain areas while failing to fund areas of the highest 
importance, including Embassy security for our diplomatic personnel in 
Kosovo and elsewhere in the region, building peace and stability in 
Kosovo to support the efforts of our troops, and contributing our 
Nation's share to the U.N. peacekeeping force there. In addition, the 
House bill fails to provide debt relief for the world's poorest nations.
    Because the needs in my budget request are essential and immediate, 
I urge the Senate to turn swiftly to its work on the budget request and 
to produce a better, right-sized bill, that includes the necessary level 
of funding for Kosovo and debt relief, and that should pass without 
delay.

Note: The statement referred to LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program.
