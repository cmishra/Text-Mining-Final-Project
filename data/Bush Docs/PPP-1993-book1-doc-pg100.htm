Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
February 12, 1993

    Q. Mr. President, what kind of feedback have you been getting, sir? 
What kind of feedback you've been getting from the Congressmen and----
    The President. Very helpful.
    Q. Do you think the Republicans will go along with you?
    The President. Well, I don't know. Right now, I'm gathering their 
ideas and opinions, and we'll see. I hope so.
    Q. Are you going to cut spending, sir, on the space station and the 
super collider?
    The President. Tune in Wednesday.
    Q. Have you started writing the speech?
    The President. I've started putting the elements of it together. It 
may not be as much of a speech as a talk.

Note: The exchange began at 3:08 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
this exchange.
