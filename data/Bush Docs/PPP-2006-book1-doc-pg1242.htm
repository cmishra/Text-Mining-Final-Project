Remarks Following a Tour of Graceland With Prime Minister Junichiro 
Koizumi<Koizumi, Junichiro<ls-thn-eq> of Japan in Memphis
June 30, 2006

    President Bush. First of all, the Prime Minister and I would like to 
thank Priscilla<Presley, Priscilla<ls-thn-eq> and Lisa<Presley, Lisa 
Marie<ls-thn-eq> for their gracious hospitality. And we thank the 
Graceland staff as well for arranging this unusual experience. First of 
all, my presence here shows it's never too late to come to Graceland. 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are--we've known Elvis Presley since 
we were growing up. He's obviously a major part of our music history. He 
had an international reputation. His reputation was so strong that he 
attracted the attention of the now Prime Minister of Japan.
    I was hoping the Prime Minister would want to come to Graceland. I 
knew he loved Elvis; I didn't realize how much he loved Elvis. He not 
only knows Elvis's history, he can sing a pretty good Elvis song. This 
visit here shows that not only am I personally fond of the Prime 
Minister, but the ties between our peoples are very strong as well.
    And so, again, to the<Presley, Priscilla<ls-thn-eq> 
Presleys,<Presley, Lisa Marie<ls-thn-eq> thank you all. And Mr. Prime 
Minister, glad you joined us. Want to say a few comments?
    Prime Minister Koizumi. It's like a dream. I never expected Mr. 
President come with me to visit Graceland. There's Elvis song: ``To 
Dream Impossible.'' [Laughter]

[At this point, Prime Minister Koizumi sang an Elvis song.]

    Prime Minister Koizumi. My dream came true. So thank you very much 
for--[inaudible]--thank you. Thank you very much for treating me nice. 
That's an Elvis song.

    President Bush. We're going to go have some barbeque. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:44 a.m. on the front lawn at Graceland. 
In his remarks, he referred to the late entertainer Elvis Presley's 
wife, Priscilla, and daughter, Lisa Marie.
