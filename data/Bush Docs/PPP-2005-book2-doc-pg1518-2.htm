Memorandum on the African Burial Ground in New York City
October 4, 2005

Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior

Subject: African Burial Ground, New York City

    The African Burial Ground, located in New York City, is a National 
Historic Landmark administered by the General Services Administration 
(GSA). This site includes objects of historic and scientific 
significance that may be appropriate for Federal protection through 
designation as a National Monument under the Antiquities Act of 1906 (16 
U.S.C. 431).
    The GSA's archaeological research has identified over 400 human 
remains, along with associated artifacts dating back to the 18th 
century. Further exploration at the discovered site may provide research 
on the experience of the African population in Colonial New York.
    Accordingly, please provide me with an assessment of the historic 
and scientific significance of the African Burial Ground and whether it 
may warrant permanent Federal protection through designation as a 
National Monument.

                                                          George W. Bush
