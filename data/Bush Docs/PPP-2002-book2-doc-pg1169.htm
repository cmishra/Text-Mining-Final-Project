Letter to Congressional Leaders on Termination of the National Emergency 
With Respect to the Taliban
July 2, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Pursuant to section 202(a) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 
U.S.C. 1622, I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order that 
terminates the national emergency described and declared in Executive 
Order 13129 of July 4, 1999, related to the actions and policies of the 
Taliban, and amends Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, to 
include reference to Mohammed Omar and the Taliban in the Annex to that 
order, thus preserving the sanctions imposed against the Taliban.
    I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
