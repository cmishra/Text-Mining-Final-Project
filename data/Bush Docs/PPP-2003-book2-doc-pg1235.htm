Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Legislation Banning 
Partial-Birth Abortion
October 2, 2003

    I applaud the House for passing the ban on partial-birth abortion so 
soon after the
congressional conferees completed their
work. Today's action is an important step that will help us continue to 
build a culture of life in America. I look forward to the Senate passing 
this legislation so that I can sign this very important bill into law.
