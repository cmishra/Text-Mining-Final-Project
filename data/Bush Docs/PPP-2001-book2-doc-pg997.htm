 Exchange With Reporters in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin
 August 20, 2001

     The President.  Everybody enjoying themselves in Waco?
     Q.  Love it.
     The President.  That's the spirit.

Situation in the Middle East/Visit to Harley-Davidson

    Q. Sir, there were some comments on the Sunday chat shows yesterday 
that you're disconnected in the Middle East peace process. Do you have 
any response to that?
    The President. Every time I talk to you all, you ask me about the 
Middle East. Nothing has changed. We're very much engaged, trying to 
break the cycle of violence. I spoke to Ariel Sharon<Sharon, 
Ariel> the other day. The Secretary of State<Powell, Colin 
L.> is in constant dialog with the parties in the Middle East. 
In order to get to a peace process or discussions of peace, we must end 
the violence, and it requires two parties. It requires the desires of 
both parties to do that.
    Thank you. Anything else?
    It's great to be here in one of the world-class manufacturing 
companies, a company that not only is good at making a product, a 
company that is fabulous at marketing a product. The Harley-Davidson is 
a great example of the American entrepreneurial spirit. I look forward 
to having lunch with the workers and thank them for putting out such a 
quality product.

Note: The exchange began at 12:10 p.m. outside the Harley-Davidson 
Pilgrim Road Powertrain Operations factory. In his remarks, the 
President referred to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel. A tape was 
not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
