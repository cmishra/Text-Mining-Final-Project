Statement on the Roadmap for Peace in the Middle East
April 30, 2003

    On March 14, I noted the important steps taken by the Palestinian 
Legislative Council (PLC) toward the creation of an empowered, 
accountable office of Prime Minister. The PLC has now confirmed a new 
Palestinian Prime Minister<Abbas, Mahmoud> ``Abu Mazen'' and 
Cabinet. Today the roadmap for peace developed by the United States over 
the last several months in close cooperation with Russia, the European 
Union, and the United Nations has been presented to Israel and the 
Palestinians.
    The roadmap represents a starting point toward achieving the vision 
of two states, a secure state of Israel and a viable, peaceful, 
democratic Palestine, that I set out on June 24, 2002. It is a framework 
for progress towards lasting peace and security in the Middle East. 
Implementing the roadmap will depend upon the good faith efforts and 
contributions of both sides. The pace of progress will depend strictly 
on the performance of the parties.
    I urge Israelis and Palestinians to work with us and with other 
members of the international community and above all directly with each 
other to immediately end the violence and return to a path of peace 
based on the principles and objectives outlined in my statement of June 
24, 2002. Both Israelis and Palestinians have suffered from the terror 
and violence and from the loss of hope in a better future of peace and 
security. An opportunity now exists to move forward. The United States 
will do all it can to seize this opportunity. To that end, I have asked 
Secretary Powell<Powell, Colin L.> to travel to the region to 
begin working with the parties so that we can take advantage of this 
moment.
