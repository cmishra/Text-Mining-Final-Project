Statement on the Death of Amir Essa bin Salman Al-Khalifa<Khalifa, Essa 
bin Salman Al-> of Bahrain
March 6, 1999

    I would like to express my deep sadness at the news that Shaikh Essa 
bin Salman Al-Khalifa of Bahrain has passed away. The prayers and 
condolences of all Americans go out to the royal family and the people 
of Bahrain.
    The Amir was a good friend of the American people and a good friend 
of peace. He shared our desire to see a just, comprehensive and lasting 
peace in the region. I take heart from the personal commitment to 
forwarding the cause of peace the Amir expressed during his recent June 
visit to the United States. The Amir shared his heartfelt hope to see 
peace come to his region in eloquent and passionate words.
    Shaikh Essa did much to deepen and strengthen the historic 
relationship between America and Bahrain. He will be missed.
