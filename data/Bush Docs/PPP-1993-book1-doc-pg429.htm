Nomination for Posts at the National Endowment for the Humanities
April 13, 1993

    The President announced his intention to nominate Sheldon Hackney to 
be Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities, National 
Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, today. He will also name 
Michael Shapiro to be the Endowment's General Counsel.
    ``The National Endowment for the Humanities plays a vital role in 
encouraging and enhancing a better understanding of our country's rich 
heritage,'' said the President. ``Doing just that has been the work of 
Sheldon Hackney's life. Likewise, Michael Shapiro has demonstrated true 
ability in the management of cultural institutions. I am confident that 
the NEH will flourish in their hands.''

the Press Secretary.
