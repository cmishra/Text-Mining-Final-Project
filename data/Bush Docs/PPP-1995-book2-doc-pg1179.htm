Statement on the Death of Major Richard J. Meadows
July 29, 1995

    I mourn the passing today of Major Richard J. Meadows, USA (Ret.), 
whose dedicated and exceptional service is cherished by everyone who 
knew of his extraordinary courage and selfless service.
    I recently had asked General Wayne Downing, the commander-in-chief 
of the U.S. Special Operations Command, to present the Presidential 
Citizens Medal to Major Meadows. I am gratified to know that Major 
Meadows' wife, Pamela; his son, Mark, a U.S. Army captain; and daughter, 
Michele, will receive this award tonight at a gathering of those 
involved in the Sontay raid at Hurlburt Field. Although this will now be 
a posthumous honor, I am pleased that Major Meadows knew of this honor 
before he died.
    To Major Meadows' family and friends and to the Special Operations 
community, I extend my heartfelt condolences. We will all remember him 
as a soldier's soldier and one of America's finest unsung heroes.
