Exchange With Reporters After Signing the Book of Condolence at the 
Indian Embassy
January 3, 2005

    Q. Mr. President, you have come this far; are you planning to extend 
your visit someday to India? It could be before your Presidency----
    The President. Well, I appreciate that very much. I was just telling 
the Ambassador, when I spoke to the Prime Minister<Singh, 
Manmohan<ls-thn-eq> I assured him that my intentions were to make it 
this year to India. In the meantime, though, our country stands with the 
people who have suffered. We want the Indian Government, the Indian 
people to know that we'll help in any way we can. I've asked President 
Clinton<Clinton, William J.<ls-thn-eq> and President Bush<Bush, George 
H.W.<ls-thn-eq> to lead an effort to raise private contributions to go 
to the families of those who have suffered and to help provide food, 
medicine, water, shelter, whatever the Indian Government thinks is 
necessary.
    I want to thank the Indian Government for taking a lead in this 
issue. One of the first things that we did was to put together a core 
group of nations, nations that are capable of organizing relief efforts 
around the region. And the Indian Government has been especially strong 
as a part of this core group. And I told the Ambassador<Sen, 
Ranendra<ls-thn-eq> to thank the Prime Minister<Singh, 
Manmohan<ls-thn-eq> for his very strong leadership.
    Our navies are coordinating together; our search and rescues are 
coordinating together. And now the American people and the American 
Government want to help where help is needed.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 11:01 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India; and India's Ambassador to the 
U.S. Ranendra Sen.
