Statement on the International Convention Against Doping in Sport
August 4, 2008

    Today I signed the instrument of ratification for the International 
Convention Against Doping in Sport adopted by the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization on October 19, 2005.
    This convention is a valuable tool in protecting the integrity of 
international sport and the health of athletes. The convention advances 
international cooperation on doping control matters and promotes a

drug-free competitive environment for athletes. Ratification of the 
convention represents the culmination of the longstanding efforts of the 
international community and the United States to jointly develop an 
equitable and harmonized approach to antidoping control and enforcement 
measures in international competition. Importantly, the convention 
highlights the vital role of youth education, comprehensive drug 
testing, and research in combating doping.
    The timing of the United States ratification, on the eve of the 
Beijing Olympic Games, is appropriate. Over the next several weeks, the 
world will be focused on the talent and dedication of the world's most 
accomplished athletes. The convention makes clear that the use of 
performance-enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts 
the positive attributes of sport.
    I remain particularly concerned that doping sends to young people 
the message that performance is more important than character and 
health. As a result, my administration has aggressively pursued 
education campaigns, research, and drug testing, as well as cooperation 
among public and private partners to encourage clean, fair, and healthy 
sport competition. These efforts have coincided with a significant 
decline in the number of young people using performance-enhancing drugs.
    The challenges posed by doping must also be addressed by 
international cooperation and collaboration. By ratifying the 
convention, the United States is demonstrating its continued commitment 
and leadership in working with the international community to combat 
this public health issue.
