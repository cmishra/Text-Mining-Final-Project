Message to the Congress Transmitting Proposed Temporary Public Debt 
Limit Increase Legislation
November 13, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    In disapproving H.R. 2586, a bill that would have, among other 
things, provided for a temporary increase in the public debt, I stated 
my desire to approve promptly a simple increase in the debt limit. 
Accordingly, I am forwarding the enclosed legislation that would provide 
for such an increase.
    I urge the Congress to act on this legislation promptly and to 
return it to me for signing.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

November 13, 1995.
