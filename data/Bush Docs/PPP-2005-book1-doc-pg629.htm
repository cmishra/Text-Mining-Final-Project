Remarks on the Election of Pope Benedict XVI
April 19, 2005

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I offer our congratulations to Pope 
Benedict XVI. He's a man of great wisdom and knowledge. He's a man who 
serves the Lord. We remember well his sermon at the Pope's funeral in 
Rome, how his words touched our hearts and the hearts of millions. We 
join with our fellow citizens and millions around the world who pray for 
continued strength and wisdom as His Holiness leads the Catholic Church.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 3:31 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House upon arrival from Springfield, IL.
