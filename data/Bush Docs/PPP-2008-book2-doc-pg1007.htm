Remarks on Intelligence Reform Legislation
July 9, 2008

    Today the United States Congress passed a vital piece of legislation 
that will make it easier for this administration and future 
administrations to protect the American people. This vital intelligence 
bill will allow our national security professionals to quickly and 
effectively monitor the plans of terrorists outside the United States, 
while respecting the liberties of the American people.
    This legislation is critical to America's safety; it is long 
overdue. Months ago, my administration set out key criteria that this 
intelligence legislation would have to have before I would sign it into 
law. The Attorney General<Mukasey, Michael B.<ls-thn-eq> and Director of 
National Intelligence<McConnell, J. Michael<ls-thn-eq> report that the 
bill Congress passed today meets these criteria, and therefore, I will 
soon sign the bill into law.
    This bill will help our intelligence professionals learn who the 
terrorists are talking to, what they're saying, and what they're 
planning. It will ensure that those companies whose assistance is 
necessary to protect the country will themselves be protected from 
lawsuits for past or future cooperation with the Government. It will 
uphold our most solemn obligation as officials of the Federal Government 
to protect the American people.
    I want to thank the members of my administration who worked hard to 
get this legislation passed. I thank the Democratic and Republican 
leadership in the Congress for their efforts, particularly House 
Majority Leader Hoyer,<Hoyer, Steny H.<ls-thn-eq> House Republican Whip 
Blunt,<Blunt, Roy<ls-thn-eq> Senators Bond<Bond, Christopher S. 
``Kit''<ls-thn-eq> and Rockefeller,<Rockefeller, John Davison ``Jay,'' 
IV<ls-thn-eq> Congressmen Hoekstra,<Hoekstra, Peter<ls-thn-eq> 
Reyes,<Reyes, Silvestre<ls-thn-eq> and Smith.<Smith, Lamar 
Seeligson<ls-thn-eq>
    This legislation shows that even in an election year, we can come 
together and get important pieces of legislation passed.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 4:01 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Attorney General Michael B. 
Mukasey. Due to the 13-hour time difference, these remarks were made 
after those to the White House press pool in Toyako, Japan.
