Statement on Signing the Combating Autism Act of 2006
December 19, 2006

    For the millions of Americans whose lives are affected by autism, 
today is a day of hope. The ``Combating Autism Act of 2006'' will 
increase public awareness about this disorder and provide enhanced 
Federal support for autism research and treatment. By creating a 
national education program for doctors and the public about autism, this 
legislation will help more people recognize the symptoms of autism. This 
will lead to early identification and intervention, which is critical 
for children with autism. I am proud to sign this bill into law and 
confident that it will serve as an important foundation for our Nation's 
efforts to find a cure for autism.

Note: S. 843, approved December 19, was assigned Public Law No. 109-416.
