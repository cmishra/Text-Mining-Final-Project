    The President announced his choices today for several senior 
positions at the Department of Justice. He intends to nominate Philip 
Heymann to be Deputy Attorney General. He is nominating Webster Lee 
Hubbell to be Associate Attorney General and Drew S. Days III to be 
Solicitor General.
    ``The team that Attorney General Reno and I are putting together at 
the Justice Department is talented, strong, and ready to move forward 
quickly to tackle the many difficult issues the Department faces.'' said 
the President. ``With this core group in place, we can move forward to 
make an independent, aggressive force working to achieve justice for all 
Americans and safe streets across our country. I hope that the Senate 
will quickly confirm these outstanding individuals.''
