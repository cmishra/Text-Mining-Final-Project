Remarks at George W. Bush Elementary School in Stockton
October 3, 2006

    The President. I want to thank Sylvia Ulmer,<Ulmer, 
Sylvia<ls-thn-eq> the principal of George W. Bush Elementary School, for 
welcoming me. It's such an honor, Sylvia--and Jack,<McLaughlin, 
Jack<ls-thn-eq> thank you, sir--it's such an honor to have a school 
named after me. When I pulled in the parking lot and I saw George W. 
Bush Elementary, I couldn't think of a higher tribute to a person, and I 
thank you all and the citizens of this community for this honor and 
tribute. Frankly, I was a little emotional when I pulled in----
    Sylvia Ulmer.<Ulmer, Sylvia<ls-thn-eq> So am I. So am I.
    The President. I want to thank the teachers and the faculty here. I 
can't wait to tell Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> that I went into the 
Laura Bush Library and saw teachers working hard to teach kids how to 
read. It's just a blessing to be there.
    You know, being at this school reminds us, we have a special 
responsibility to protect our children. One of the most important jobs 
of those involved with schools and government is to make sure that 
children are safe. And Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I were saddened 
and deeply concerned, like a lot of other citizens around the country, 
about the school shootings that took place in Pennsylvania and Colorado 
and Wisconsin. We grieve with the parents, and we share the concerns of 
those who worry about safety in schools.
    Yesterday I instructed Attorney General Gonzales<Gonzales, Alberto 
R.<ls-thn-eq> and Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings<Spellings, 
Margaret<ls-thn-eq> to convene a meeting next Tuesday, a meeting of 
leading experts and stakeholders, to determine how best the Federal 
Government can help States and local governments improve school safety. 
Our schoolchildren should never fear their safety when then enter to a 
classroom. And, of course, the superintendent<McLaughlin, 
Jack<ls-thn-eq> and principal<Ulmer, Sylvia<ls-thn-eq> know that.
    We also had a reminder of the need for people in positions of 
responsibility to uphold that responsibility when it comes to children, 
in the case of Congressman Mark Foley.<Foley, Mark A.<ls-thn-eq> I was 
dismayed and shocked to learn about Congressman Foley's unacceptable 
behavior. I was disgusted by the revelations and disappointed that he 
would violate the trust of the citizens who placed him in office.
    Families have every right to expect that when they send their 
children to be a congressional page in Washington, that those children 
will be safe. We have every right as citizens to expect people who hold 
higher office behave responsibly in that office. I fully support Speaker 
Hastert's<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> call for an investigation by law 
enforcement into this matter. This investigation should be thorough, and 
any violations of the law should be prosecuted.
    Now, I know Denny Hastert;<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> I meet with 
him a lot. He is a father, teacher, coach, who cares about the children 
of this country. I know that he wants all the facts to come out, and he 
wants to ensure that these children up there on Capitol Hill are 
protected. I'm confident he will provide whatever leadership he can to 
law enforcement in this investigation.
    Again, I want to thank you for your hospitality. It's an honor to be 
here. Appreciate your time. God bless. Thank you.
