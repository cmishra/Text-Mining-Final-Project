Statement on Child Safety Locks for Handguns
August 14, 1997

    This week, Smith and Wesson, the world's largest manufacturer of 
handguns, announced that it is forging a partnership with the Master 
Lock Co. to provide a child safety lock with every handgun sold for 
commercial use. I applaud both of these companies for their efforts to 
promote gun safety.
    I particularly want to commend Smith and Wesson for taking an 
important and responsible step for children's safety. Child safety locks 
are the right thing to do. In 1994, 185 children were killed by 
accidental gunshot wounds. That is why my anti-gang and youth violence 
legislation would require that all federally licensed gun dealers 
provide such safety devices with every handgun sold. And that is why on 
March 3d I ordered all Federal agencies to provide child safety locks 
with the thousands of handguns they issue to Federal law enforcement 
officers.
    Child safety locks have garnered the wide support of law 
enforcement, the medical community, many local governments, and now a 
part of the firearms manufacturing industry. This fall the full Senate 
considers the anti-juvenile crime legislation. I hope they will include 
the child safety lock as part of the legislation.
