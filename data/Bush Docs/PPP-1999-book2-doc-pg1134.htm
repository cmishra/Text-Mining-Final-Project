Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting on the National Emergency With 
Respect to the Taliban
July 4, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) and section 301 of the National 
Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1631, I hereby report that I have exercised 
my statutory authority to declare a National emergency with respect to 
the threat to the United States posed by the actions and policies of the 
Afghan Taliban and have issued an executive order to deal with this 
threat.
    The actions and policies of the Afghan Taliban pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States. The Taliban continues to provide safe haven to Usama bin 
Ladin<bin Ladin, Usama> allowing him and the Al-Quida 
organization to operate from Taliban-controlled territory a network of 
terrorist training camps and to use Afghanistan as a base from which to 
sponsor terrorist operations against the United States.
    Usama bin Ladin<bin Ladin, Usama> and the Al-Qaida 
organization have been involved in at least two separate attacks against 
the United States. On August 7, 1998, the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, 
Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were attacked using powerful 
explosive truck bombs. The following people have been indicted for 
criminal activity against the United States in connection with Usama bin 
Ladin and/or the Al-Qaida organization: Usama bin Ladin, his military 
commander Muhammed Atef,<Atef, Muhammed> Wadih El Hage,<El 
Hage, Wadih> Fazul Abdullah Mohammed,<Mohammed, Fazul 
Abdullah> Mohammed Sadeek Odeh,<Odeh, Mohammed 
Sadeek> Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-Owhali,<Owhali, Mohamed Rashed 
Daoud Al-> Mustafa Mohammed Fadhil,<Fadhil, Mustafa 
Mohammed> Khalfan Khamis Mohamed,<Mohamed, Khalfan 
Khamis> Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani,<Ghailani, Ahmed 
Khalfan> Fahid Mohammed Ally Msalam,<Msalam, Fahid Mohammed 
Ally> Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan,<Swedan, Sheikh Ahmed 
Salim> Mamdouh Mahmud Salim,<Salim, Mamdouh Mahmud> 
Ali Mohammed,<Mohammed, Ali> Ayman Al-Zawahiri,<Zawahiri, 
Ayman Al-> and Khaled Al Fawwaz.<Fawwaz, Khaled Al> 
In addition, bin Ladin and his network are currently planning additional 
attacks against U.S. interests and nationals.
    Since at least 1998 and up to the date of the Executive order, the 
Taliban has continued to provide bin Ladin<bin Ladin, Usama> 
with safe haven and security, allowing him the necessary freedom to 
operate. Repeated efforts by the United States to persuade the Taliban 
to expel bin Ladin to a third county where he can be brought to justice 
for his crimes have failed. The United States has also attempted to 
apply pressure on the Taliban both directly and through frontline states 
in a position to influence Taliban behavior. Despite these efforts, the 
Taliban has not only continued, but has also deepened its support for, 
and its relationship with, Usama bin Ladin and associated terrorist 
networks.
    Accordingly, I have concluded that the actions and policies of the 
Taliban pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States. I have, therefore, 
exercised my statutory authority and

issued an Executive order which, except to the extent provided for in 
section 203(b) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1072(b)) and regulations, orders, 
directives or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date:
    --blocks all property and interests in property of the Taliban, 
        including the Taliban leaders listed in the annex to the order 
        that are in the United States or that are or hereafter come 
        within the possession or control of United States persons;
    --prohibits any transaction or dealing by United States persons or 
        within the United States in property or interests in property 
        blocked pursuant to the order, including the making or receiving 
        of any contribution of funds, goods, or services to or for the 
        benefit of the Taliban;
    --prohibits the exportation, re-exportation, sale, or supply, 
        directly or indirectly, from the United States, or by a United 
        States person, wherever located, of any goods, software, 
        technology (including technical data), or services to the 
        territory of Afghanistan under the control of the Taliban or to 
        the Taliban; and
    --prohibits the importation into the United States of any goods, 
        software, technology, or services owned or controlled by the 
        Taliban or from the territory of Afghanistan under the control 
        of the Taliban.
    The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, is directed to authorize commercial sales of agricultural 
commodities and products, medicine and medical equipment, for civilian 
end use in the territory of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban under 
appropriate safeguards to prevent diversion to military, paramilitary, 
or terrorist end-users or end-use or to political end-use. This order 
and subsequent licenses will likewise allow humanitarian, diplomatic, 
and journalistic activities to continue.
    I have designated in the Executive order, Mullah Mohhamad 
Omar,<Omar, Mohhamad> the leader of the Taliban, and I have 
authorized the Secretary of State to designate additional persons as 
Taliban leaders in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and 
the Attorney General.
    The Secretary of the Treasury is further authorized to designate 
persons or entities, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the 
Attorney General, that are owned or controlled, or are acting for or on 
behalf of the Taliban or that provide financial, material, or technical 
support to the Taliban. The Secretary of the Treasury is also authorized 
to issue regulations in the exercise of my authorities under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement these measures 
in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. 
All Federal agencies are directed to take actions within their authority 
to carry out the provisions of the Executive order.
    The measures taken in this order will immediately demonstrate to the 
Taliban the seriousness of our concern over its support for terrorists 
and terrorist networks, and increase the international isolation of the 
Taliban. The blocking of the Taliban's property and the other 
prohibitions imposed under this executive order will further limit the 
Taliban's ability to facilitate and support terrorists and terrorist 
networks. It is particularly important for the United States to 
demonstrate to the Taliban the necessity of conforming to accepted norms 
of international behavior.
    I am enclosing a copy of the Executive order I have issued. This 
order is effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 6, 1999.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on July 6. 
The Executive order of July 4 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
