Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to the Situation In or In Relation to the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo
October 24, 2007

To the Congress of the United States:
    The situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and atrocities that 
continue to threaten regional stability and was addressed by the United 
Nations Security Council in Resolution 1596 of April 18, 2005, 
Resolution 1649 of December 21, 2005, and Resolution 1698 of July 31, 
2006, continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13413 of October 27, 2006, and the related measures 
blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the conflict.
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation 
to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the related measures 
blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the conflict in 
that country, must continue in effect beyond October 27, 2007.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 October 24, 2007.
