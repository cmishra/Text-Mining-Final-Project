Message to the Congress on Extending the Period of Production of the 
Naval Petroleum Reserve
October 9, 2002

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 201(3) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves 
Production Act of 1976 (10 U.S.C. 7422(c)(2)), I am informing you of my 
decision to extend the period of production of the Naval Petroleum 
Reserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, 2003, the expiration date 
of the currently authorized period of production.
    Enclosed is a copy of the report investigating the necessity of 
continued production of the reserves as required by section 
201(3)(c)(2)(B) of the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. 
In light of the findings contained in the report, I certify that 
continued production from the Naval Petroleum Reserves is in the 
national interest.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 October 9, 2002.
