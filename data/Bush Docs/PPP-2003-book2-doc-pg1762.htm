Message on the Observance of New Year's Day, 2004
December 31, 2003

    The past year has been a time of accomplishment and progress. 
Working together, our citizens have made America a safer, more 
prosperous, and better country. In the New Year, we will build on these 
successes, embracing the challenges and opportunities ahead.
    We have seen our brave men and women in uniform defend America and 
liberate the oppressed. We pray for their safety, and we are grateful 
for their service and the support of their families.
    In the past year, millions of people have answered the call to serve 
their neighbors in need. Americans from every walk of life are building 
a culture of compassion by devoting their time and talents to help 
others. In the New Year, I ask all Americans to answer the call to bring 
hope to those who are less fortunate.
    I encourage every American to give thanks to God for His many 
blessings and to reaffirm our commitment to peace and freedom around the 
world. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in wishing all Americans a 
Happy New Year. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless the 
United States of America.

                                                          George W. Bush
