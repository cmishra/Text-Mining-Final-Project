Radio Address to California Flood Victims
January 11, 1995

    Last night I declared a major disaster in the State of California. 
The necessary assistance will be made available to thousands of victims 
of the flooding in both northern and southern California.
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is working closely 
with State and local officials to ensure a quick response to the flood. 
FEMA Director James Lee Witt is in California to ensure that disaster 
funds begin to flow quickly to the State. These funds will help to begin 
the process of recovery, and we'll be with you for the long haul.
    I want to say a special word of thanks to all the young volunteers 
from AmeriCorps, our national service program, for the quick and good 
work they have done. Californians have proven over the last few years 
that they have a resilient spirit and a great sense of community. You 
have shown in the earthquake and the fires and now in these floods that 
you are a people who come together in times of crisis. The American 
people are with you.
    Hillary and I send our thoughts and prayers to the thousands of 
victims, and we wish you well.

Note: The address was recorded at approximately 9:20 a.m. in the Oval 
Office at the White House for later broadcast.
