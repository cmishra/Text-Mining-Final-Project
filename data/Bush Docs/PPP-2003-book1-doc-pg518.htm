Statement on House of Representatives Action on Healthy Forests 
Restoration Legislation
May 20, 2003

    Today's action by the House on the ``Healthy Forests Restoration Act 
of 2003'' is an important step toward implementing the kind of active 
forest management that is good for both the environment and our economy. 
It will save lives and the national treasure of our great forests, with 
their wildlife, trees, waters, habitat, and other natural resources.
    I urge the Senate to act quickly on this much-needed legislation. As 
this year's fire season progresses, we must equip Federal land managers 
with the tools they need to protect lives and communities, restore 
forest health, and safeguard habitat and watersheds.
