Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Report on Peacekeeping 
Operations
July 25, 2000

Dear Mr. Chairman:
    I am pleased to transmit herewith the 1999 Annual Report to the 
Congress on Peacekeeping required by section 4 of the United Nations 
Participation Act (Public Law 79-264), as amended.
    United Nations and other peacekeeping operations helped us protect 
our interests before they were directly threatened, and ensured that 
other nations shared with us the risks and costs of maintaining 
international stability.
    I look forward to working with you to ensure that peacekeeping 
remains a viable option for dealing with international conflicts.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations; John W. Warner, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Armed Services; Ted Stevens, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Appropriations; Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman, House Committee on 
International Relations; C.W. Bill Young, chairman, House Committee on 
Appropriations; and Floyd Spence, chairman, House Committee on Armed 
Services. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on July 26.
