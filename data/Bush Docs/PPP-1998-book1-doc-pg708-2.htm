Statement on Funding To Fight Methamphetamines
May 6, 1998

    I am pleased today to announce $8.8 million of new Federal money 
from the Office of National Drug Control Policy's High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Program to fight methamphetamines, a deadly drug. These new 
funds will bolster joint Federal, State and local law enforcement 
efforts now underway as part of this Administration's comprehensive 
National Methamphetamine Strategy. By further strengthening the ability 
of law enforcement to target those who produce and push 
methamphetamines, we take this deadly drug and the accompanying crime 
off our streets and protect our children.
