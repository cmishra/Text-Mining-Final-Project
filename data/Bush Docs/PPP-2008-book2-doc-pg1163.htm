Statement on the Selection of Governor Sarah Palin<Palin, 
Sarah<ls-thn-eq> of Alaska as Republican Vice Presidential Candidate
August 29, 2008

    Today Senator McCain<McCain, John<ls-thn-eq> made an exciting 
decision in choosing Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to join him on his 
ticket as the Vice Presidential candidate. Governor Palin is a proven 
reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for 
accountability in government. Governor Palin's success is due to her 
dedication to principle and her roll-up-your-sleeves work ethic and 
serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of America. By selecting a 
working mother with a track record of getting things done, Senator 
McCain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming 
Washington.
    I applaud Senator McCain<McCain, John<ls-thn-eq> for selecting 
Governor Palin. This decision is yet another example of why the American 
people can trust him to make wise decisions and to confidently lead this 
country.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
