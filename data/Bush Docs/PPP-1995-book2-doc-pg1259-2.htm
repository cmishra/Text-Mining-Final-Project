Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on the 
Partnership For Peace
August 17, 1995

Dear Mr. Chairman:  (Dear Claiborne:)  (Dear Lee:)
    In accordance with Section 514(a) of Public Law 103-236 (22 U.S.C. 
1928(a)), I am submitting to you this report on implementation of the 
Partnership for Peace (PFP) initiative.
    The ongoing adaptation of Europe's security structures to post-Cold 
War realities remains one of our highest foreign policy priorities. A 
central element of this adaptation is the extension of NATO's zone of 
stability and security to include Europe's emerging democracies. Over 
the past year and a half the Partnership for Peace has made a 
significant contribution to this goal by forging new cooperative ties 
between the Alliance and its partners. This U.S. initiative has united 
NATO Allies with former adversaries and traditionally neutral states in 
a partnership based on respect for democratic principles, peaceful 
resolution of disputes, and practical cooperation. Consistent with our 
broad, inclusive approach to European security, the Partnership embraces 
26 partner states, including Russia.
    For all Partners, PFP will be an enduring instrument for forging 
stronger ties with NATO. For those Partners interested in joining NATO, 
PFP will be the path to membership.
    Already, through joint training exercises and other PFP activities, 
PFP is helping interested Partners improve the ability of their forces 
to work alongside NATO's for possible future joint missions. As you will 
see from the attached report, NATO and its partners have made impressive 
progress in broadening and deepening the Partnership over the past year. 
We are working with our Allies and Partners to build on the 
Partnership's early momentum, in the shared conviction that cooperation 
and common action

are among the best means to achieving lasting peace and security 
throughout the Euro-Atlantic area.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Jesse Helms, chairman, and 
Claiborne Pell, ranking member, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations; 
and Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman, and Lee H. Hamilton, ranking member, 
House Committee on International Relations.
