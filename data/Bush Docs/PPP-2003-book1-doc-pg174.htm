Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Iraq
February 13, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq 
Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243) and as part of my effort to keep 
the Congress fully informed, I am providing a report prepared by my 
Administration on matters relevant to that resolution including on 
matters relating to planning for post-liberation Iraq under section 7 of 
the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-338). The report also 
discusses recent developments in the areas previously reported pursuant 
to section 3 of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq 
Resolution (Public Law 102-1) on our efforts to obtain compliance by 
Iraq with the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security 
Council.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
