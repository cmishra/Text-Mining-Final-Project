Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Emergency 
Funding for Disaster Relief
April 15, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    In accordance with provisions of Public Law 107-73, the Departments 
of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002, I hereby request and make available 
$250 million for the disaster relief program of the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS).
    These funds would allow DHS to continue providing assistance for 
disasters in several States, including the recovery of the Columbia 
space shuttle and the damaging winter storms on the East Coast. These 
funds also would be available for ongoing response to prior disasters 
and to ensure that DHS has resources on hand to provide timely response 
to future disasters.
    I designate these funds made available today as an emergency 
requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
    The details of this action are set forth in the attached letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his 
comments and observations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
