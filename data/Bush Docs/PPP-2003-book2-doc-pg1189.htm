Statement on the Transition of the Secretary General of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization
September 22, 2003

    I welcome today's decision by NATO to appoint Jaap de Hoop 
Scheffer,<de Hoop Scheffer, Jakob Gijshert ``Jaap''<ls-thn-eq> the Dutch 
Foreign Minister, as its next Secretary General, beginning in January 
2004. Mr. de Hoop Scheffer is a leader deeply committed to freedom and 
to strong and effective transatlantic cooperation. I look forward to 
working with him.
    I also commend Lord Robertson<Lord Robertson<ls-thn-eq> for his many 
achievements during his 4 years as Secretary General. Under his 
leadership, NATO welcomes seven new countries. He helped launch a new 
relationship between NATO and Russia. He spearheaded an ambitious agenda 
of transformation to make NATO forces lighter, faster, and better able 
to meet the challenges of the 21st century. During his tenure, NATO 
mounted its first operation outside its traditional area, proving that 
our Alliance can address terrorist threats where they arise. He made 
NATO a vital partner in the war on terror and in the effort to rebuild 
the newly freed nations of Afghanistan and Iraq.
    The American people will always remember Lord Robertson's<Lord 
Robertson<ls-thn-eq> leadership when after the September 11th attacks 
NATO invoked its solemn collective defense clause for the first time in 
its history. On behalf of all Americans, I extend best wishes to Lord 
Robertson as he prepares to depart his post as Secretary General of NATO 
and America's gratitude for a job well done.
