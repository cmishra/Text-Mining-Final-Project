Statement on House of Representatives Action on Welfare Reform
March 24, 1995

    At a time when so many Americans without regard to party agree on 
the need for welfare reform, it's a shame the House of Representatives 
could not produce a real welfare reform plan that would promote work and 
responsibility and attract broad bipartisan support. I am disappointed 
that instead of joining in a real, bipartisan effort to move people from 
welfare to work, a narrow partisan Republican majority passed a bill 
that is weak on work and tough on children.
    I am determined to work with Republicans and Democrats in Congress 
to produce the kind of welfare reform Americans, regardless of party 
affiliation, want and expect. To end welfare as we know it, we must be 
tough on work and tough on deadbeat parents not tough on children.

    I commend the House of Representatives on one part of the bill that 
enjoyed true bipartisan support--tough measures on child support 
enforcement, including refusing drivers' and professional licenses to 
deadbeat parents who refuse to pay child support. The House passed every 
major child support element of our welfare reform plan, which will 
enable us to mount the toughest child support enforcement crackdown in 
history. It is time to demand responsibility from parents who bring 
children into the world, not let them off the hook and expect taxpayers 
to pick up the tab for their neglect.
    Welfare reform can and must be a bipartisan issue. I look forward to 
working with Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to pass real 
welfare reform that will make work and responsibility the law of the 
land.
