Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Federal Agency 
Climate Change Programs and Activities
March 15, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with section 568(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2000, as contained 
in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2000 (Public Law 106-113), I 
transmit herewith an account of all Federal agency climate change 
programs and activities. This report includes both domestic and 
international programs and activities related to climate change, and 
contains data on both spending and performance goals.
    As the comprehensive nature of this report indicates, my 
Administration believes that climate change presents one of the premier 
challenges that America--and the world--will face in this new century. 
Informed by sound science and based on prudent measures, I believe it is 
critical that the Federal Government provide leadership to address this 
serious challenge and to act on behalf of our citizens and future 
generations. Our action plan, as detailed in this report, features 
numerous investments in scientific research, in proven public-private 
partnerships, and in efforts to promote new and developing technologies 
and practices that will not only reduce greenhouse gases, but will 
provide significant new economic opportunities and savings for American 
businesses and consumers.
    I appreciate the interest of the Congress in this important issue 
and in our efforts to address it. I urge the Congress to fully support 
these initiatives and to join my Administration in meeting the challenge 
of climate change.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
