Remarks on the Unveiling of a Group of Seven Commemorative Plaque in 
Halifax
June 17, 1995

    Ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to say a few words--I'm sure I 
speak on behalf of all of us here--to thank the people of Halifax and 
Nova Scotia and the leaders for making us feel so welcome and to say a 
special word of appreciation for the leadership Prime Minister Chretien 
has given to this conference. The people of Canada can be very, very 
proud of the direction and leadership that he gave this G-7 conference. 
It has been more businesslike, more informal, and more specific in its 
suggestions for what we can do to improve the lives of our people than 
many of our previous meetings. And I think it is due to the leadership 
of the Prime Minister. And all of us wanted to express that to the 
people of Canada. We are very, very grateful for it.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:05 a.m. at the Halifax Waterfront. A 
tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
