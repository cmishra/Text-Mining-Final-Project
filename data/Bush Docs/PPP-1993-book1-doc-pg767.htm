May 28, 1993

China

    Q. Heard anything from China, Mr. President? Their reaction, the 
Chinese reaction?
    The President. I don't know what their--I feel very good about our 
policy. I think it's a good policy. I don't want to isolate China. I 
want to do what's good for--just the Chinese people. But I think 
standing up for American values and values in China is the way to go. I 
think this is the right policy. And we have some very serious issues 
between us, along with these, a broad range of possibilities. I hope we 
can work----

Note: The exchange began at 10:07 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White
