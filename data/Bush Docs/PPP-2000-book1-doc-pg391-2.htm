Statement on the Sale of F-16 Aircraft to the United Arab Emirates
March 5, 2000

    I welcome the news that the negotiation for the sale of F-16 
aircraft to the United Arab Emirates has been successfully concluded and 
that the agreement has been signed. Completion of this sale is another 
significant step in the strategic relationship between the United States 
and the United Arab Emirates and reflects the importance we attach to 
strengthen the defensive capability of one of our most important friends 
in the Gulf. This sale is also important for the viability of our 
defense industrial base and will benefit American workers. I want to 
personally thank President bin Zayid<Nuhayyan, Zayid bin<ls-thn-eq> for 
his commitment to making this aircraft sale a reality.
