Message on the Observance of Passover, 5766
April 11, 2006

    Say therefore to the people of Israel, ``I am the Lord, and I will 
bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will 
deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with an 
outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment.''

                                                              Exodus 6:6

    I send greetings to those observing Passover, beginning at sundown 
on April 12.
    The story of the Jewish people throughout history reflects the 
triumph of faith, the importance of family, and the power of hope. 
During Passover, Jewish people across America and around the world 
gather together with family and friends to celebrate the liberation of 
the Children of Israel from slavery. By reading the Haggadah, singing 
traditional songs, and sharing the Seder meal, Jewish people relive the 
story of their redemption and ensure that their values and heritage are 
passed on to future generations.
    During this celebration of faith and hope, we are reminded that 
freedom is the Almighty's gift to every man, woman, and child. We pray 
for a more peaceful and hopeful world where the blessings of liberty are 
bestowed upon all mankind.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a 
blessed Passover.

                                                          George W. Bush
