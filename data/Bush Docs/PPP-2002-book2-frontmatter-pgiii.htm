                               Foreword

    This volume collects my speeches and papers from the second half of 
2002, a period in which the United States witnessed the passage of 
significant domestic reforms as we continued vigorously to pursue the 
war on terror abroad.

    On the home front, my Administration worked with the Congress to 
rouse an economy rocked by corporate scandals and the attacks of 
September 11. To bolster the worker and investor confidence essential 
for the functioning of any free market, in July 2002 I signed into law 
the most sweeping corporate reforms in more than 50 years. The Congress 
also passed Trade Promotion Authority after an 8-year lapse, giving me a 
stronger hand to open new markets abroad for American farmers, ranchers, 
workers, and entrepreneurs. The Congress also responded to our call by 
passing legislation making terrorism insurance available and affordable, 
as well as new laws that promoted conservation of our wetlands, expanded 
community health centers, and helped cities and States update their 
voting systems.

    From the outset, my Administration has made it clear that in order 
to best serve Americans in need, faith-based and community organizations 
must be free to compete for Federal grants on a level playing field. In 
December 2002, I signed an Executive Order directing all Federal 
agencies to follow the principle of equal treatment in awarding social-
service grants. In Congress, meanwhile, we continued to work for passage 
of legislation advancing my faith-based and community initiative. We 
also continued to work for a comprehensive energy plan and a Medicare 
reform bill that would include a prescription drug benefit. And to speed 
our economic recovery, we urged the Congress to make permanent the tax 
relief passed in 2001.

    Throughout this period, protecting the American people from attack 
remained our highest priority. During the second half of 2002, we saw 
important victories. Ramzi Binalshibh, a key al-Qaida chief who shared a 
house with Mohamed Atta in Germany and helped plan the September 11 
attacks, was captured along with several other al-Qaida operatives in 
Pakistan, exactly a year to the day after the attack on our homeland. We 
worked with our allies to take the offense against terrorists, breaking 
up their cells and disrupting their infrastructure. And in our 2003 
defense budget, we provided the largest increase in defense spending 
since Ronald Reagan's Presidency so that our Armed Forces would have the 
resources they need to defend our security and freedom.

    As we pursued terrorists abroad, we took vital steps to secure the 
homeland. The creation of a new Department of Homeland Security 
represented the most extensive reorganization of the Federal Government 
since the start of the Cold War. This department united dozens of 
Federal agencies in a single mission of protecting the American people 
and sharing critical information. We also acted to improve the 

[[Page vi]]

security 
of our ports, coasts, and borders, and we began increasing our 
stockpiles of vaccine to inoculate our population in the event of 
biological attack.

    Protecting Americans from terrorist attack also required us to 
address other threats before they fully materialized, including that 
posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq. In September, I urged the United Nations 
to consider Saddam's longstanding refusal to disarm and abide by all 
U.N. resolutions. After a spirited and civil debate, the Congress 
approved a strong bipartisan resolution, authorizing me to take military 
action to disarm the Iraqi regime in the event its dictator refused to 
meet his obligations to the world. In November, the U.N. Security 
Council passed a unanimous resolution demanding that Saddam disarm in 
compliance with its previous resolutions; allow thorough inspections; 
and abandon the tactics of denial and delay he had used to avoid 
accountability for more than a decade.

    America did not seek conflict with Iraq. By year's end, the many 
warnings the Congress and the U.N. had given had made clear that the 
choice between peace and war rested with Saddam Hussein.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 43d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period July 1-December 31, 2002. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not

printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Herbert Hoover, 
Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. 
Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, 
George Bush, and William J. Clinton are also included in the Public 
Papers series.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents publication program is under the 
direction of Frances D. McDonald, Managing Editor, Office of the Federal 
Register. The series is produced by the Presidential and Legislative 
Publications Unit, Gwendolyn J. Henderson, Chief. The Chief Editor of 
this book was Karen Howard Ashlin, assisted by Loretta F. Cochran, 
Kathleen M. Fargey, Stephen J. Frattini, Alison M. Gavin, Christopher 
Gushman, Margaret A. Hemmig, Maxine Hill, Alfred Jones, Stacey A. 
Mulligan, and Michael J. Sullivan.

    The frontispiece and photographs used in the portfolio were supplied 
by the White House Photo Office. The typography and design of the book 
were developed by the Government Printing Office under the direction of 
Bruce R. James, Public Printer.
