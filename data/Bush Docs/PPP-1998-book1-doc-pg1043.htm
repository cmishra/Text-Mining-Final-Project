Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Peacekeeping 
Operations
June 24, 1998

Dear Mr. Chairman:
    I am pleased to transmit herewith the 1997 Annual Report to the 
Congress on Peacekeeping. The report is required by section 407(d) of 
the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 
(Public Law 103-236).
    The report provides an account of how the United States used 
peacekeeping last year to promote regional stability and to advance U.S. 
interests. Our support for United Nations and other peacekeeping 
operations allowed us to protect our interests before they were directly 
threatened and ensured that other nations shared with us the risks and 
costs of maintaining stability in the post-Cold War world.
    Working together, we brought greater discipline to decisionmaking in 
national capitals and at the United Nations regarding multilateral peace 
operations. Tough questions about mandate, size, cost, duration, and 
exit strategy for proposed missions were answered before operations were 
approved. Careful attention was also given to ensuring that those 
responsible for leading peacekeeping missions--the United Nations, NATO, 
or a coalition of concerned states--were capable of successfully 
achieving the intended objective.
    I look forward to working with you to ensure that peacekeeping 
remains a viable option for dealing with international conflicts of 
interest to the United States.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Floyd Spence, chairman, House 
Committee on National Security; Robert L. Livingston, chairman, House 
Committee on Appropriations; Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman, House 
Committee on International Relations; Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations; Strom Thurmond, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Armed Services; and Ted Stevens, chairman, Senate Committee 
on Appropriations.
