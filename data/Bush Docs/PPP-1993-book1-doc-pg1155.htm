Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Meeting With 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti
July 22, 1993

    President Clinton held a cordial and constructive meeting this 
morning with President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti. The meeting 
lasted about 30 minutes. This was their first meeting since the signing 
of the so-called Governors Island agreement on July 3, although they 
spoke by telephone on July 4.
    The President commended President Aristide on his signing of the 
agreement, which establishes a sound timetable for the restoration of 
democracy and for Aristide's return to Haiti on October 30, just 100 
days from now. The President described the agreement as an historic step 
forward for democracy, economic prosperity, and freedom for Haiti. He 
reaffirmed that the United States will continue to play a leadership 
role with the international community in helping foster a better life 
for the Haitian people.
    The President and President Aristide discussed the steps that need 
to be taken to fulfill the terms of the agreement, including the naming 
of a new Prime Minister by President Aristide in consultation with 
members of the Haitian Parliament.
