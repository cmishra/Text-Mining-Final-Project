Remarks at a Dinner Honoring the Dance Theatre of Harlem
February 6, 2006

    Good evening. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I welcome you to the 
White House for what is going to be a very special evening. One of the 
interesting things about living here is that, on occasion, some of our 
Nation's finest artists come to perform. Nothing like having great 
performers in your living room. [Laughter] And tonight we're looking 
forward to a fantastic performance.
    As we gather during African American History Month, tonight we honor 
the Dance Theatre of Harlem and its unique founder, Arthur 
Mitchell.<Mitchell, Arthur<ls-thn-eq> America is blessed to have people 
like Arthur Mitchell in our midst. So, Arthur, thank you for coming; 
thank you for your care and concern for our Nation's youth; and thank 
you for being dogged in your determination to see that this program 
flourishes. And we're glad to be a part of seeing that the program does 
flourish.
    Since its creation in 1969, the company has set a new standard for 
excellence in dance and has won international acclaim. The Dance Theatre 
of Harlem School has provided thousands of students the opportunity to 
study dance, some of whom we'll see tonight. The Dance Theatre's 
community outreach programs are now bringing arts education to people 
all across America and around the world.
    For almost four decades, the Dance Theatre of Harlem has done a lot 
to enrich countless lives through its brilliant performances and 
educational efforts. And so tonight I offer a toast to the achievements 
and continued success of Arthur Mitchell<Mitchell, Arthur<ls-thn-eq> and 
the Dance Theatre of Harlem.

Note: The President spoke at 7:56 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House.
