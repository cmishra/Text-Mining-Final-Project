Joint Statement on Anti-Personnel Landmines
June 27, 1998

    The United States and China reaffirm their commitment to ending the 
humanitarian crisis caused by the indiscriminate use of anti-personnel 
landmines (APL). They both maintain that efforts to eliminate the APL 
threat to civilians should be pursued consistent with national security 
requirements.
    The United States and China recognize the importance of the Amended 
Protocol II to the Convention on Conventional Weapons in addressing 
humanitarian concerns resulting from the indiscriminate use of 
landmines. They agree to work toward the early ratification of the 
Amended Protocol and urge others to ratify it as well.
    The United States and China agree to actively pursue at the 
Conference on Disarmament the commencement of negotiations on an anti-
personnel landmines transfer/export ban by supporting the prompt 
establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee.
    The United States and China commit to accelerate global humanitarian 
demining operations with the objective of eliminating the threat of 
anti-personnel landmines to civilians as soon as possible. The United 
States and China reaffirm their commitments to furnish demining 
assistance, which could include mine awareness, training in mine 
clearance, and technology for detection and clearance, through 
appropriate channels to affected countries with the objective of 
promoting their indigenous capacity for humanitarian demining.

Note: The joint statement was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary, but it was not issued as a White House press release.
