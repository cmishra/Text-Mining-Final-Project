Statement on the Death of General Maxwell R. Thurman
December 2, 1995

    We mourn the passing yesterday of Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, USA, 
Ret., whose dedicated and exceptional service is cherished by everyone 
who knew of his extraordinary courage, enduring vision, and selfless 
service. During a distinguished career which culminated in his service 
as commander in chief of the U.S. Southern Command, General Thurman 
achieved prominence as a disciplined thinker, organizer, and leader. His 
foresight and leadership in a succession of key recruiting, personnel, 
military doctrinal development, and training assignments during the 
1970's and eighties helped shape the post-Vietnam Army and transform it 
into the high-quality, ready-to-fight force of today.
    To General Thurman's family and friends and to the Army community, I 
extend my heartfelt condolences. We will remember him as one of 
America's finest soldiers and most capable military leaders.
