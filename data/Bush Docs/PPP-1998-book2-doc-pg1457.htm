Statement on the Terrorist Bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland
August 15, 1998

    Today's terrorist bombing in Omagh was a barbaric act intended to 
wreck Northern Ireland's aspirations for peace and reconciliation. On 
behalf of every American, I condemn this butchery and hope that the 
culprits will be brought to justice quickly. I extend our deep sympathy 
to those affected by this tragedy. I renew my pledge to stand with the 
people of Northern Ireland against the perpetrators of violence; they 
will find no friends here.
    Now is the time for the parties of peace in Northern Ireland to 
redouble their efforts.
