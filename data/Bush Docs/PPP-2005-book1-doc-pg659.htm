Exchange With Reporters in Crawford, Texas
April 25, 2005

President's Meeting With Crown Prince Abdullah<Crown Prince 
Abdullah<ls-thn-eq> of Saudi Arabia

    Q. What do you expect to get out of this meeting, sir?
    The President. Do you like the footpath?
    Q. Let's talk about the meeting.
    The President. This is an important relationship--personal 
relationship with the Crown Prince is important. I look forward to 
talking with him about a variety of subjects. I'm glad you're here. 
Thank you for coming. I hope you're enjoying this day.

Oil Prices/Energy Legislation

    Q. How much progress can you make on oil prices?
    The President. I'll be glad to answer those questions at a later 
time.
    Q. Later today?
    The President. No. No, of course I'll talk about energy. And the 
Crown Prince<Crown Prince Abdullah<ls-thn-eq> understands that it's very 
important for there to be a--make sure that the price is reasonable. A 
high oil price will damage markets, and he knows that. I look forward to 
talking to him about that. But as well as--you know, we'll talk about 
his country's capacity. It's an important subject.
    One thing is for certain: I need to sign an energy bill. I 
appreciate the House passing the energy bill, and now it's time for the 
Senate to pass the energy bill. The bill is a long time in coming. The 
Vice President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> and I suggested they pass a bill 
in 2001, and nothing happened. Now is the time for something to happen. 
I'm looking forward to getting back to Washington and continue to talk 
about energy.
    Q. Sir, do you think gas prices can be any lower than it is today?
    The President. That depends on the supply and demand. One thing is 
for certain: The price of crude is driving the price of gasoline. The 
price of crude is up because not only is our economy growing, but 
economies such as India and China's economies are growing.
    Here comes my guest.<Crown Prince Abdullah<ls-thn-eq> Anyway, nice 
going; you got me to answer some questions.

Note: The exchange began at 11:05 a.m. at the Bush Ranch.
