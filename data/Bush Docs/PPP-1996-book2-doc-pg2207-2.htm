Letter to Congressional Leaders on Cyprus
December 13, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus 
question. The previous submission covered progress through July 31, 
1996. The current submission covers the period August 1, 1996, through 
September 30, 1996.
    I regret that intercommunal violence, including unprecedented 
killings of civilians, dominated events in Cyprus during this reporting 
period. These incidents raised intercommunal tensions to their worst 
level in many years and complicated efforts aimed at achieving a lasting 
solution to the Cyprus dispute. In meetings with the two Cypriot 
communities and the governments of Greece and Turkey, my representatives 
noted that the violence underscored the unsustainability of the status 
quo and the need for redoubled efforts toward a negotiated settlement. 
They advised that provocative rhetoric and actions be avoided to permit 
intercommunal relations to move onto a more constructive track.

Similar calls were made by the United Nations and the European Union.
    Notwithstanding the tragic events of August and September, my 
Administration remains committed to promoting a lasting peace on the 
island. Given the urgency of the current situation, we are appealing 
again for the implementation of practical measures to reduce the 
potential for conflict. We remain hopeful that both sides will recognize 
the importance of such measures and put them into immediate effect.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
