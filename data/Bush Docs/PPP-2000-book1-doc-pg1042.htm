Statement on the Upcoming Elections in Peru
May 26, 2000

    I deeply regret the decision by the Peruvian electoral authorities 
to proceed with the elections this coming Sunday in spite of the well-
documented concerns of the OAS observer mission. Even a relatively brief 
delay would give the OAS mission an opportunity to monitor the electoral 
process with greater confidence.
    As things stand, the OAS mission will not monitor Sunday's vote. I 
believe that is the correct decision under the circumstances.
    Free, fair, and open elections are the foundation of a democratic 
society. Without them, our relationship with Peru inevitably will be 
affected.
    We are consulting with our partners in the hemisphere and the 
international community to determine appropriate next steps.
