Statement of Condolence on the Death of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of 
Israel
November 5, 1995

    Prime Minister Rabin gave his life to Israel, first as a soldier for 
its freedom, then finally as a martyr for its lasting peace.
    For his example, his friendship to the United States, and his warm 
friendship to me, I am eternally grateful.

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: The President inscribed this statement in a condolence book at the 
Israeli Embassy. An original was not available for verification of the 
content of this statement.
