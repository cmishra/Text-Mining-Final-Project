Remarks on Arrival in Houston, Texas
July 18, 2008

Congressional Candidate Pete Olson<Olson, Pete<ls-thn-eq>

    It sure is good to be back in Houston, Texas. I am--I've come back 
to help Pete Olson win the congressional seat in the 22d Congressional 
District. I'm proud to support him. He's a Rice University graduate; he 
went to the University of Texas Law School; Navy fighter pilot; proud 
father, loyal husband, and a smart guy.

convinced Congressman Olson understands that. We've got to make sure we 
keep our taxes low. And one thing is for certain: We need to explore for

gasoline prices. One way to take the pressure off gasoline prices is to 
make it clear that the United States is going to be active about finding

country. And I'm convinced we can do so in environmentally friendly 
ways.
    No doubt in my mind, Pete Olson will make a fine United States 
Congressman, and I'm proud to be here to support him.

Note: The President spoke at 2:38 p.m. at Ellington Field.
