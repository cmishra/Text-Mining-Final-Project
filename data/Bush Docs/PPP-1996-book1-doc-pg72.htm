Message on the Observance of Ramadan
January 19, 1996

    Greetings to everyone observing the holy month of Ramadan.
    As the crescent moon signals the approach of this most sacred time 
in the Islamic year, Muslims the world over commemorate the revelation 
of the Koran to Muhammad. For Muslims, this marks a time of quiet 
reflection and religious devotion through fasting, self-examination, and 
intensive study of the teachings of Islam. Encouraging gratitude for our 
blessings and compassion for those in need, Ramadan cleanses the heart 
and lifts the soul.
    During this time of unprecedented movement toward peace in the 
Middle East, Muslims and people of all faiths have the opportunity to 
join together in creating a new world of harmony. Ramadan, with its 
promise of renewal, helps to nourish the spirit of brotherhood in us 
all. In this season of hope, let us resolve to work together for a 
better, brighter future--a future in which children of every religion 
can live together in peace.
    Hillary and I offer best wishes to Muslims everywhere for a 
memorable observance.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on
