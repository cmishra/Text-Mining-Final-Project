Statement on the Decision by Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, Maryland, 
Not To Seek Reelection
December 3, 1998

    Since becoming President in 1993, it has been my good fortune to 
work very closely with Mayor Kurt Schmoke on issues about which the 
residents of Baltimore and our Nation care. He has been a wonderful 
partner in our efforts to improve the quality of education for all 
children, increase the availability of health care and housing, enhance 
economic development in our inner cities, and revitalize our 
neighborhoods. In addition, Mayor Schmoke has been a dependable ally in 
our efforts to make our streets free from drugs and guns.
    I am grateful to the mayor for his public service to Baltimore and 
our Nation, and I look forward to making the most use of every day 
remaining in his current term of office to continue our work together.
