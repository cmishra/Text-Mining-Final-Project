Statement on House of Representatives Action on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
November 29, 1994

    Tonight the United States House of Representatives cast an historic 
vote for American workers, farmers, and families. This overwhelming 
bipartisan vote in support of the GATT legislation demonstrates our 
confidence in America's ability to compete and win in the global 
economy.
    Passage of the Uruguay round will provide enormous benefits for the 
United States: hundreds of thousands of new U.S. jobs, $100-$200 billion 
per year in increased GDP, and a $744 billion global tax cut.
    This vote demonstrates to the American people that Democrats and 
Republicans can work together in the national interest. The Uruguay 
round agreement is the product of 8 years of work by three 
administrations--Republican and Democratic. A strong majority of each 
party cast votes in favor of the agreement.
    The eyes of the world are now on the United States Senate. I call on 
the Senate to pass GATT with the same strong, bipartisan support as it 
received in the House of Representatives.
