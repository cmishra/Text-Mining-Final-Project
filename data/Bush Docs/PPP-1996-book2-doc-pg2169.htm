Message on the Observance of Hanukkah, 1996
December 5, 1996

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Hanukkah.
    In this season of joy, we remember the story of Judah Maccabee and 
his steadfast followers who freed Jerusalem from its oppressors and 
rededicated the Temple to God. Although they had only a small supply of 
consecrated oil with which to rekindle the temple's Holy Light, the 
courage and faith of the Maccabees were rewarded as the oil burned 
miraculously for eight days and eight nights until a new supply could be 
prepared.
    Today, more than two thousand years later, families around the world 
celebrate this Festival

of Lights by coming together in prayer, giving thanks to God for His 
many blessings, exchanging gifts, and lighting the eight candles of the 
menorah, one candle for each night that the sacred oil burned.
    Steeped in ritual and rich in meaning, Hanukkah imparts profound 
lessons to us: that faith in God can sustain us through any adversity; 
that peace ultimately comes to those who persevere; and that, just as 
the shammas passes its light to each candle in the menorah, so too must 
we share our hope and faith and joy with one another. In this way, we 
can ensure that the light kindled on that first Hanukkah so many 
centuries ago will continue to burn brightly for the generations to 
come.
    Hillary and I extend best wishes to all for a wonderful holiday 
celebration.

                                                            Bill Clinton
