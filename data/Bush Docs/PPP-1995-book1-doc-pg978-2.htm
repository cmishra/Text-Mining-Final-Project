June 29, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 446 of the District of Columbia Self-
Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the 
District of Columbia's Proposed FY 1995 Second Supplemental Budget and 
Rescissions of Authority Request Act and the Proposed FY 1996 Budget 
Request Act.
    The Proposed FY 1996 Budget has not been reviewed or approved by the

``Act''). It will be subject to such review and approval pursuant to 
section 208 of the Act.
