                                Foreword

    The papers in this volume cover events from the second half of 
2001--a period of history that saw America come under terrible attack 
and undertake a global war against terrorism.

    In the summer of 2001, our Government was moving forward on many 
important issues. Based on my proposals, the Congress considered 
historic reforms in public education, which they passed late in the 
year. Americans were beginning to reap the benefits of major tax relief. 
My Administration set clear standards on a question of profound moral 
consequence. I barred the use of Federal funds for stem cell research to 
prevent any further destruction of human embryos while allowing funding 
of potentially life-saving research on embryos where the life and death 
decision had already been made. On a trip to Europe, I affirmed 
America's commitment to wider trade and an expanded NATO Alliance. And 
in the presence of troops stationed in Kosovo, I signed legislation to 
increase the pay and benefits of our men and women in uniform.

    Then, on the morning of September 11th, enemies of our country 
brought violence and grief to the people of the United States. The 
ruthlessness of the attacks stirred our Nation to anger and resolute 
action, while the heroism of victims and rescuers inspired deep respect 
and pride in our fellow citizens.

    On that day we entered a new kind of war. No longer could we rely on 
two great oceans for protection. Our Government took unprecedented steps 
to safeguard the American homeland from further attack, and to prepare 
for any that might come.

    I ordered the Armed Forces into battle in Afghanistan to root out 
the terrorists, destroy their camps, and remove the regime that had made 
that country a terrorist haven. I committed our Nation to alleviate the 
suffering of the Afghan people by providing educational and medical 
assistance, and by working with international institutions to help 
rebuild Afghanistan. And Laura, while serving as a calming voice of 
reassurance here at home, led efforts to ensure that women in 
Afghanistan could achieve independence and receive the benefits of full 
participation in society and government.

    Americans celebrated the Holidays in a time of testing, with losses 
to mourn and great tasks to complete. Yet we bowed our heads in humble 
appreciation for the remarkable fortitude of our people, the resilience 
of the American spirit, and the unique heritage of faith and patriotism 
in the face of adversity that is ours as citizens of the United States 
of America.

    As the year drew to a close, the successful campaign in Afghanistan 
continued. We began to rebuild where the terrorists had struck, in New 
York and at the Pentagon. Our Government took crucial steps to speed the 
recovery of industries struggling in the aftermath of September 11th. 
And across the world, a great coalition assembled to oppose terror 
networks and terror states, and to defend freedom in the first war of 
the 21st century.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 43d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period July 1-December 31, 2001. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not

printed full-text in the book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and
other Presidential documents released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary and published in the Federal Register. This information 
appears in the appendixes at the end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Herbert Hoover, 
Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. 
Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, 
George Bush, and William J. Clinton are also included in the Public 
Papers series.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents publication program is under the 
direction of Frances D. McDonald, Managing Editor, Office of the Federal 
Register. The series is produced by the Presidential and Legislative 
Publications Unit, Gwendolyn J. Henderson, Chief. The Chief Editor of 
this book was Karen Howard Ashlin, assisted by Kathleen M. Fargey, 
Stephen J. Frattini, Christopher Gushman, Margaret A. Hemmig, Maxine 
Hill, Alfred Jones, Loretta C. Jones, Stacey A. Mulligan, Lydia C. Poon, 
Michael J. Sullivan, and Karen A. Thornton.

    The frontispiece and photographs used in the portfolio were supplied 
by the White House Photo Office. The typography and design of the book 
were developed by the Government Printing Office under the direction of 
Bruce R. James, Public Printer.
