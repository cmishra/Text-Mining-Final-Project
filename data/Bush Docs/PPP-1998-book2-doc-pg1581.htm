Statement on the Death of George C. Wallace
September 14, 1998

    Hillary and I offer our condolences to the family and friends of 
George Wallace. I remember working with him at the Governors' conference 
in 1983. Governor Wallace was wheelchair-bound and often in great pain, 
but he rolled into the committee room to provide the crucial vote that 
enabled the Governors to help save Federal support for disabled 
Americans unable to work.
    Like the State he served as Governor and the region he represented 
as a candidate for President, George Wallace made a painful--but 
essential--journey, abandoning, in the end, the politics of division and 
embracing the politics of inclusion and reconciliation. For that, all 
Americans can be grateful.
