Remarks on the Russia-United States Strategic Offensive Reductions 
Agreement
May 13, 2002

    The President. Good morning.
    The Press. Good morning.
    The President. Today I'm pleased to announce that the United States 
and Russia has agreed to a treaty which will substantially reduce our 
nuclear arsenals to the agreed-upon range of 1,700 to 2,200 warheads. 
This treaty will liquidate the legacy of the cold war.
    When I sign the treaty with President Putin<Putin, 
Vladimir> in Russia, it will begin the new era of U.S.-Russian 
relationships. And that's important. The new era will be a period of 
enhanced mutual security, economic security, and improved relations.
    I look forward to going to Moscow to sign this treaty. It is--it 
will be the culmination of a lot of months of hard work and a 
relationship built on mutual trust that

Slovenia.
    This is good news for the American people today. It'll make the 
world more peaceful, and put behind us the cold war once and for all.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 8:32 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House, prior to his departure for Chicago, IL. In his remarks, he 
referred to President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
