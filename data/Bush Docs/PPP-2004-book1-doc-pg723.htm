Statement on the Enlargement of the European Union
May 3, 2004

    I applaud the action by the European Union (EU) to welcome into 
their membership 10 new countries from Central Europe and the 
Mediterranean. This enlargement will bring opportunity and hope to 
millions of Europeans. Along with NATO's expansion, the EU's enlargement 
further unites the new and the established democracies of Europe and 
helps create a Europe whole, free, and at peace. We welcome the prospect 
of further enlargement of the EU to qualified countries, including 
Romania and Bulgaria, and we support Turkey's European Union 
aspirations.
    This new European Union will more effectively play its essential 
role as a force for democracy, prosperity, and stability. This action 
strengthens the enduring partnership between the United States and 
Europe and marks a major advance for the common values and purposes of 
our transatlantic community.
