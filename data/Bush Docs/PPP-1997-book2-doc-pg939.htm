Statement on the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Decision To Stop Using 
the Joe Camel Character in Tobacco Advertisements
July 10, 1997

    I welcome R.J. Reynolds' decision today to stop using Joe Camel in 
its advertisements. This step is long overdue. As I said last year when 
we announced the FDA rule to protect youth from tobacco, we must put 
tobacco ads like Joe Camel out of our children's reach forever. I am 
glad RJR has finally taken this step today, and I hope other companies 
will follow suit. In the months ahead, I will keep fighting until the 
days of marketing tobacco to our children are over.
