Statement on United States Military Personnel Recommendations From 
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates<Gates, Robert M.<ls-thn-eq>
January 5, 2007

    I am pleased to accept the recommendations of Secretary Gates for 
several key positions in our Nation's Armed Forces. These leaders are 
accomplished military professionals whose experience, skill, and 
dedication will enable them to successfully lead our troops as they 
protect our country.
    General George Casey<Casey, George W., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> has been a 
strong and effective commander of the Multi-National Force in Iraq. I 
have come to depend on his wise counsel and solid judgment in our 
efforts to protect the American people in the war on terror. I look 
forward to working with him in his new role as Chief of Staff of the 
United States Army. General Casey will succeed General Peter 
Schoomaker,<Schoomaker, Peter J.<ls-thn-eq> who has done an outstanding 
job in helping transform the U.S. Army to confront the challenges of the 
21st century. I wish General Schoomaker all the best as he retires from 
active duty after a distinguished career.
    Lieutenant General Dave Petraeus<Petraeus, David H.<ls-thn-eq> will 
succeed General Casey.<Casey, George W., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> General Petraeus 
is a soldier of vision and determination. His service in Iraq has 
equipped him with expertise in irregular warfare and stability 
operations and an understanding of the enemy we face. I am confident 
that General Petraeus has the right experience, leadership skills, and 
judgment to be an outstanding commander of MNF-I.
    Admiral William J. Fallon,<Fallon, William J.<ls-thn-eq> currently 
the commander of U.S. Pacific Command, has earned a reputation as one of 
our country's foremost military strategists. His experience and 
leadership will be critical to helping our country achieve victory over 
the radicals and extremists who threaten freedom. He will be an 
excellent commander of U.S. Central Command.
    Admiral Fallon<Fallon, William J.<ls-thn-eq> will succeed General 
John Abizaid,<Abizaid, John P.<ls-thn-eq> who has overseen some of our 
military's most extraordinary efforts to spread freedom and democracy. 
He has earned the respect and admiration of a grateful nation, and his 
service is a model for those who wear our country's uniform. As he 
retires, I express my deep appreciation for all he has done for America.

Note: The statement referred to Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, USA, 
commanding general, U.S. Army Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth.
