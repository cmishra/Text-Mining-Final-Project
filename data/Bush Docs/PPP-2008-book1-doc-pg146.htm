Remarks Honoring the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup Champion
February 5, 2008

    The President. You know, one of the things I love about NASCAR is 
not only are these great athletes, but they're socially minded folks. 
And Chandra<Johnson, Chandra Janway<ls-thn-eq> and Jimmie<Johnson, 
Jimmie<ls-thn-eq> and I met several times--one time at a place where the 
folks of NASCAR are putting something back into the community to help 
the less fortunate. In this case, it happened to be in a place called 
Victory Junction in North Carolina, and it was a fabulous experience. 
And I want to thank you all very much for taking your fame and lending 
it to help somebody in need. It's really what makes America a great 
place. And you're leaders on the track and leaders off the track.
    Jimmie Johnson.<Johnson, Jimmie<ls-thn-eq> Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 1:09 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson and 
his wife Chandra.
