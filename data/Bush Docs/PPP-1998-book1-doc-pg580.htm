Statement on Tornado Damage in Arkansas and Tennessee
April 16, 1998

    I was deeply saddened to learn this morning of the tragic deaths of 
two small children in Arkansas, as well as the deaths of two individuals 
from Dyer County, Tennessee. My heart goes out to their parents and 
families and to the many who have suffered in both States. The 
destruction of last night's tornadoes was swift and powerful, and the 
threat of another storm looms in its wake.
    Disaster relief efforts began today at daybreak. James Lee 
Witt,<Witt, James Lee<ls-thn-eq> the Director of FEMA, will provide me 
with an assessment of the destruction and FEMA is standing ready to 
respond if appropriate. The burden of recovery is heavy, but it will not 
be carried by these communities alone. Our thoughts and prayers are with 
the survivors as they mourn all that was lost and begin the difficult 
process of healing and rebuilding.
