To the Senate of the United States:
    Consistent with Condition (l)(A) of the resolution of advice and 
consent to the ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic 
Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, adopted by the United States Senate on 
May 8, 2003, and based on the recommendation of the Department of State, 
I hereby certify to the Senate that:
      
      
    (i) the inclusion of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, 
        Slovakia, and Slovenia in NATO will not have the effect of 
        increasing the overall percentage share of the United States in 
        the common budgets of NATO; and (ii) the inclusion of Bulgaria, 
        Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 
        NATO does not detract from the ability of the United States
