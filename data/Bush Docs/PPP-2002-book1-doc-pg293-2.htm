Statement Following a Meeting With Southern African Leaders
February 26, 2002

    Today I met with three Presidents who can help bring peace and 
prosperity to southern Africa. Presidents dos Santos<dos Santos, Jose 
Eduardo> of Angola, Chissano<Chissano, Joaquim 
Alberto> of Mozambique, and Mogae<Mogae, Festus 
Gontebanye> of Botswana and I discussed our common interests 
in working with each other and through the Southern African Development 
Community to bring greater peace, prosperity, and stability to the 
region.
    I reiterated that expanding trade is the surest path to sustainable 
development. I commended the<dos Santos, Jose Eduardo> 
three<Chissano, Joaquim Alberto> Presidents'<Mogae, Festus 
Gontebanye> leadership in developing a regional strategy to

combat HIV/AIDS and promote economic integration. As part of that 
effort, I asked the Presidents to join my call for the World Bank to 
begin providing 50 percent of its assistance to the world's poorest 
nations in the form of grants rather than loans.
    The<dos Santos, Jose Eduardo> three<Chissano, Joaquim 
Alberto> Presidents<Mogae, Festus Gontebanye> also 
discussed the tragic wars in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo. We agreed that peace is within reach of both countries. I urged 
President dos Santos to move quickly toward achieving a cease-fire in 
Angola. And we agreed that all parties have an obligation to seize this 
moment to end the war and develop Angola's vast wealth to the benefit of 
the Angolan people. President dos Santos has it within his power to end 
26 years of fighting by reaching out to all Angolans willing to lay down 
their arms. Angolans deserve no less.
    Finally, I commend the work of former President Masire,<Masire, 
Quett K.J.> President Mbeki,<Mbeki, Thabo> and other 
SADC leaders--including Presidents dos Santos,<dos Santos, Jose 
Eduardo> Chissano,<Chissano, Joaquim Alberto> 
and<Mogae, Festus Gontebanye> Mogae--on the Inter-Congolese 
Dialogue in South Africa. I remain committed to working with the leaders 
of southern Africa to achieve lasting peace and stability in the region.

Note: The statement referred to former President Quett K.J. Masire of 
Botswana and President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa.
