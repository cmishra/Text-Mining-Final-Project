Statement on the Death of Sebastian Arcos Bergnes
December 23, 1997

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Sebastian Arcos 
Bergnes, a courageous and tireless activist for human rights, democracy, 
and freedom in Cuba.
    Mr. Arcos dedicated his life to peaceful change in his beloved 
homeland. He was a man of honor and dignity who commanded enormous 
respect around the world for the sacrifices he made and the good work he 
did for the people of Cuba. As one of the founders of the human rights 
movement in Cuba, he blazed a trail which has inspired many others who 
cherish individual liberties. He was an example to us all and will be 
missed.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his son and daughter and the rest 
of the family who will carry on the effort to secure human rights in 
Cuba.
