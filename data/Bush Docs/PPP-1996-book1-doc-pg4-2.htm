Message to the Congress on Most-Favored-Nation Trade Status for Romania
January 3, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:
    On May 19, 1995, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Romania is in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria of 
sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This action allowed for 
the continuation of most-favored-nation (MFN) status for Romania and 
certain other activities without the requirement of an annual waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the 
Congress concerning emigration laws and policies of Romania. You will 
find that the report indicates continued Romanian compliance with U.S. 
and international standards in the area of emigration policy.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

January 3, 1996.
