Memorandum on Assistance for Federal Employees Affected by Hurricane 
Floyd
September 17, 1999

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Assistance for Federal Employees Affected by Hurricane Floyd

    I am deeply concerned about the devastating losses suffered by many 
as a result of Hurricane Floyd. Many parts of the Federal Government 
have been mobilized to respond to this disaster.
    As part of this effort, I ask the heads of executive departments and 
agencies to excuse from duty without charge to leave or loss of pay 
those Federal civilian employees who are affected by Hurricane Floyd and 
its aftermath and who can be spared from their usual responsibilities. 
Specifically, I request that excused absence be granted to employees who 
are needed for emergency law enforcement, relief, or clean-up efforts 
authorized by Federal, State, or other officials having jurisdiction and 
employees who are prevented from reporting for work or faced with a 
personal emergency because of Hurricane Floyd and its aftermath.
    I am also authorizing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to 
determine whether there is a need to establish an emergency leave 
transfer program to assist employees affected by this major disaster. An 
emergency leave transfer program would permit employees in an executive 
agency to donate their unused annual leave for transfer to employees of 
the same or other agencies who were adversely affected by Hurricane 
Floyd and who need additional time off for recovery. If the need for 
donated annual leave becomes evident, I direct OPM to establish the 
emergency leave transfer program and provide additional information to 
agencies on the program's administration.

                                                      William J. Clinton
