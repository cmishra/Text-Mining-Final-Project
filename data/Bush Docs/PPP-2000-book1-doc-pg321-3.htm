Statement on Emergency Assistance to Fishing Communities
February 25, 2000

    Due to the decline in important fishing stocks on the west and east 
coasts, many fishing communities are suffering unexpected losses that 
seriously threaten their livelihoods. In Long Island Sound, the lobster 
catch has fallen sharply this year. On the west coast, in Oregon, 
Washington,

and California, there has been a serious decline in groundfish stocks.
    The economic threat to fishing communities is severe. I am asking 
Congress to provide emergency assistance of $56 million to provide aid 
to those whose economic welfare is threatened by this crisis and to fund 
research to identify the causes and potential solutions to these 
problems to restore the long-term health of our vital fishing industry. 
I urge Congress to act quickly to provide relief to communities that are 
clearly in need.

Note: A portion of the President's statement was also made available on 
the White House Press Office Actuality Line.
