Remarks Following a Meeting With Chief<Mulally, Alan<ls-thn-eq> 
Executive<LaSorda, Thomas W.<ls-thn-eq> Officers<Wagoner, 
Rick<ls-thn-eq> of United States Automobile Manufacturers
November 14, 2006

    The Vice President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> and members of my 
Cabinet--Secretary of Treasury,<Paulson, Henry M., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> 
Secretary<Peters, Mary E.<ls-thn-eq> of Transportation--members of my 
staff, and I have just had a constructive and meaningful dialog with 
CEOs of the U.S. automobile manufacturers.
    First, these leaders have--are making difficult decisions, tough 
choices to make sure that their companies are competitive in a global 
economy. And I'm confident that they're making the right decisions, and 
that's good news for the American people because the automobile 
manufacturers play such a significant part of our economy and a vital 
part of our employment base.
    We've had a fascinating discussion about a lot of major issues that 
we share in common. One, of course, is rising health care costs. And I 
assured these leaders that the Government is addressing rising health 
care costs through a variety of initiatives that I think, over time, are 
going to make a significant difference in not only their cost but the 
cost to the U.S. taxpayer as well.
    We talked about our mutual desire to reduce our dependence on 
foreign oil. Obviously, as these automobile manufacturers begin to 
incorporate new technologies that will enable us to power our cars in 
different ways, it will make it easier for me to be able to tell the 
American people, we're using less foreign oil. And that's in our 
economic interests as well as in our national security interests.
    And finally, they've--these gentlemen are well aware that I'm on my 
way overseas this evening. And one of the issues I'll be talking about 
with our partners in APEC is free trade, but fair trade. And my message 
to our trading partners is, just treat us the way we treat you. Our 
markets are open for your products, and we expect your markets to be 
open for ours, including our automobiles.
    And so we've found a lot in common. We'll have a continuing dialog. 
It's in our interest that in Government we find out ways that we'll be 
able to work to make sure that this industry is as vibrant and solid as 
possible. And so this is the beginning of a series of discussions we'll 
have, not only with me but also with people in our Government. I really 
do want to thank you all for coming. I appreciate you coming.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 2:03 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. Participating in the event were Alan Mulally, president and chief 
executive officer, Ford Motor Co.; Thomas W. LaSorda, chief executive 
officer and president, Chrysler Group; and G. Richard Wagoner, Jr., 
chairman and chief executive officer, General Motors Corp.
