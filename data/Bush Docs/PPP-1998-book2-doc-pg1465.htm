Statement on Progress Against Drunk Driving
August 24, 1998

    The data released today by the Department of Transportation shows 
that we are making real progress in protecting Americans from drunk 
drivers. Last year, the number of people killed in alcohol-related 
crashes dropped to an all-time low, representing a decline of over a 
third since 1982. For the first time since we started keeping these 
statistics in 1975, drunk driving deaths accounted for less than 40 
percent of all traffic deaths. And alcohol-related fatalities among 16- 
to 20-year-olds dropped by 5 percent last year alone.
    Our progress is the result of stronger laws, tougher enforcement, 
and increased public

awareness. In particular, today's statistics show the importance of the 
legislation I fought for and signed 3 years ago to ensure zero tolerance 
for underage drinking and driving. But there is more we must do. We 
could save even more lives by passing a tough national standard of 
impaired driving at .08 blood alcohol content (BAC)--and I continue to 
challenge the Congress to enact this life-saving measure. If we work 
together, we can spare thousands of families from the grief and anger of 
losing a loved one to a preventable drunk driving crash, and make our 
roads, highways, and communities safer for all Americans.

Note: The statement referred to the National Highway System Designation 
Act of 1995, Public Law 104-59, approved November 28, 1995.
