Remarks on Lighting the National Christmas Tree
December 1, 2005

    Thank you all very much. Welcome to the Christmas Pageant of Peace. 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are so honored to join you all. The 
lighting of the National Christmas Tree is one of the great traditions 
in our Nation's Capital. Each year, we gather here to celebrate the 
season of hope and joy and to remember the story of one humble life that 
lifted the sights of humanity.
    Santa, thanks for coming. [Laughter] Glad you made it. I know you've 
got a lot of commitments this time of year. By the way, we have a lot of 
chimneys in the White House--[laughter]--if you're looking for something 
to do. I appreciate all our entertainers. Thanks for being here. This is 
a fantastic evening.
    I want to thank Peter Nostrand,<Nostrand, Peter F.<ls-thn-eq> who is 
the chairman of the Christmas Pageant of Peace, and John 
Betchkal,<Betchkal, John J.<ls-thn-eq> all the members of the board. I 
appreciate Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton,<Norton, Gale 
A.<ls-thn-eq> other members of my Cabinet who are here. I appreciate the 
Members of Congress who have come.
    I particularly want to give a special thanks to the National Parks 
Service Director Fran Mainella<Mainella, Frances P.<ls-thn-eq> and all 
the good folks who work for the National Parks Service. Reverend 
Martin,<Martin, Richard B.<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much as well.
    Christmas is a time to rejoice and to give thanks for the blessings 
of the season and for the blessings that surround us every day of the 
year. We also remember that we have a responsibility to help those in 
need. America is a compassionate and generous land, and acts of kindness 
toward others fulfill the spirit of the season.

    As we approach Christmas in this time of war, we pray for freedom 
and justice and peace on Earth. In his Christmas Eve address to the 
Nation in 1941, Franklin Roosevelt said that ``Against enemies who 
preach the principles of hate and practice them, we set our faith in 
human love, and in God's care for us and all men everywhere.'' We ask 
for God to watch over our men and women in uniform who are serving 
overseas. Their families miss them, hold a seat open for them, and pray 
for their safe return. America's military men and women stand for 
freedom, and they serve the cause of peace. Many of them are serving in 
distant lands tonight, but they are close to our hearts.
    As an expression of our hope for peace and happiness in this 
Christmas season, we light the National Christmas Tree. Jackie,<Kantor, 
Jackie<ls-thn-eq> Melissa,<Kantor, Melissa<ls-thn-eq> and Jenna 
Kantor<Kantor, Jenna<ls-thn-eq> of Bethesda are with us here. They 
started ``Project Backpack'' to give children displaced by Hurricane 
Katrina new backpacks filled with books and toys and school supplies. 
These girls are an example of the compassion that is found in the hearts 
and souls of Americans everywhere, and they have shown how much good can 
be done when we reach out to help a neighbor in need. And so Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I now invite them to join us to turn on the lights.
    And would you help turn on these lights, as well, by counting down. 
Five, four, three, two, one.

Note: The President spoke at 5:55 p.m. on the Ellipse at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to John J. Betchkal, president, 
Christmas Pageant of Peace; and Rev. Richard B. Martin, pastor, Church 
of the Nativity, Burke, VA.
