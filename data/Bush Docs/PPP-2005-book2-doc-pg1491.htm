Remarks to Reporters in Beaumont, Texas
September 27, 2005

    I just met with local county judges and mayors, along with the 
Governor.<Perry, Rick<ls-thn-eq> Obviously this area is hurt. The 
Governor knows that. I saw it firsthand, how it's hurt. We've got some 
priorities that we're in the process of working together to achieve. The 
first is food and water. The second is electricity and generators moving 
this way; there's a rational plan to distribute the generators. Thirdly, 
there's fuel. We fully understand that it's hard to maintain order if 
you don't have fuel for your cars and first-responders.
    And I appreciate the planning that the Governor<Perry, 
Rick<ls-thn-eq> put into this. The State of Texas is--took precautions 
before the storm hit and is now responding. And our job is to work with 
the State. I have the top people here with me, the Coast Guard 
admiral,<Hereth, Larry L.<ls-thn-eq> who is in charge of the Federal 
response. I had the head of FEMA<Paulison, R. David<ls-thn-eq> with me, 
and I had a three-star Army general<Clark, Robert T.<ls-thn-eq> here, 
all of them here to help make sure these people can get their lives back 
together.
    Again, the Governor<Perry, Rick<ls-thn-eq> has got a plan to make 
sure people don't come back too early. He's listening to the local 
judges and the mayors. Obviously, we want people to come home as quickly 
as possible. We want them to be able to do so in an orderly way. And 
when they get home, they find that there's a--you know, as best as 
possible, power and water.

Note: The President spoke at 10:58 a.m. at Southeast Texas Regional 
Airport. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. Rick Perry of Texas; Rear 
Adm. Larry L. Hereth, USCG, commander, Fifth Coast Guard District; R. 
David Paulison, Acting Director, Federal Emergency Management Agency; 
and Lt. Gen. Robert T. Clark, USA, commander, Joint Task Force--Rita. A 
tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
