Statement on Senator John W. Warner's<Warner, John W.<ls-thn-eq> 
Decision Not To Seek Reelection
August 31, 2007

    John Warner is one of the most dedicated Senators in American 
history. Five Presidents have relied on his steady judgment, wise 
counsel, and candid advice. With Senator Warner's retirement, the Senate 
will lose one of its most independent and widely respected voices, and 
the Commonwealth of Virginia will lose one of its fiercest advocates.
    John Warner has served our country in many roles throughout his 
distinguished career, always putting the American people's needs first. 
He enlisted in the Navy shortly before his 18th birthday and chose to 
interrupt his law studies to commence a second tour of active military 
duty as an officer in the Marine Corps, volunteering for duty in Korea. 
He went on to practice law, serve as an assistant U.S. attorney, and 
serve as Secretary of the Navy before his election to the Senate. Our 
military had no greater friend than Senator Warner during his service as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Forces.
    I look forward to working with Senator Warner in the coming months 
as we assess the situation in Iraq and pursue policies to keep our 
country safe.
    John Warner is a true statesman. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
wish Senator Warner, his wife Jeanne,<Vander Myde, Jeanne<ls-thn-eq> and 
the rest of his family all the best.
