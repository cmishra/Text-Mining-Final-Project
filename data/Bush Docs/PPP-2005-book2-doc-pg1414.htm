Memorandum on the 2005 Combined Federal Campaign
September 9, 2005

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: 2005 Combined Federal Campaign

    The Secretary of Transportation, Norman Y. Mineta, has agreed to 
serve as the Chair of the 2005 Combined Federal Campaign of the National 
Capital Area (CFC-NCA). I ask you to enthusiastically support the CFC by 
personally chairing the campaign in your agency and by encouraging top 
agency officials around the country to do the same.
    The Combined Federal Campaign is an important way for Federal 
employees to support thousands of worthy charities. Public servants not 
only contribute to the campaign but also assume leadership roles to 
ensure its success.
    Your personal support and enthusiasm will help positively influence 
thousands of employees and will result in another successful campaign.

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on September 12.
