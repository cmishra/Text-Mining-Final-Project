Statement on Senate Confirmation of United States Ambassador and 
Permanent Representative to the United Nations
August 5, 1999

    I am deeply gratified that the Senate has approved Ambassador 
<Holbrooke, Richard C.>Richard C. Holbrooke's nomination to be 
the U.S. Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations. 
I am grateful to Ambassador Holbrooke for his commitment to public 
service and especially for his willingness to persevere through the 
confirmation process.
    Vice President Gore, Secretary Albright, and I welcome him back to 
our foreign policy team. With the U.N. facing significant challenges in 
Kosovo, Iraq, Africa, and elsewhere, Ambassador Holbrooke is the right 
person to lead our efforts at the U.N. He will play a key role in 
working with the Congress to meet our obligations and to secure needed 
reforms at the United Nations.
    Since he joined the Foreign Service 37 years ago, Ambassador 
Holbrooke has served our Nation with distinction in Asia, Africa, and 
Europe. I am confident that he will represent the United States with 
dedication.
