Statement on Senator C. Trent Lott's<Lott, C. Trent<ls-thn-eq> Decision 
Not To Seek Reelection
November 26, 2007

    For more than three decades, Trent Lott has been an outstanding 
advocate in the United States Congress for the people of Mississippi. 
With service in the Republican leadership in both the House of 
Representatives and the Senate, he has skillfully advanced legislation 
and effectively championed key principles of our party, including low 
taxes and a strong national defense.
    Trent has worked to enhance the economic vitality of our Nation and 
his home State throughout his career. By focusing on the important 
defense, transportation, infrastructure, agricultural, and educational 
needs of Mississippi, he has helped bring new development and 
opportunity to his constituents.
    Throughout his service, Trent has always been a leader, someone his 
colleagues have known they could count on to stay true to his 
principles, while working cooperatively to achieve results for the 
American people. Trent enjoyed bipartisan respect because of his 
reverence for the institutions of Congress and because Republicans and 
Democrats knew they could count on him to keep his commitments and his 
word. His immense talent will be missed in our Nation's Capital. 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish him and his wife Tricia<Lott, 
Patricia Thompson<ls-thn-eq> all the best.
