Statement on Proposed Citizen Service Legislation
May 24, 2002

    I commend House Select Education Subcommittee Chairman Peter 
Hoekstra<Hoekstra, Peter> and Ranking Member Tim 
Roemer<Roemer, Tim> for their bipartisan leadership in 
introducing H.R. 4854, the ``Citizen Service Act of 2002.'' In January, 
I called upon all Americans to dedicate at least 2 years--the equivalent 
of 4,000 hours--over the course of their lives in service to others, and 
I laid out policies for fostering service all across the country and 
around the world. Increasing opportunities for all Americans to 
participate in meaningful service activities is a priority of this 
administration, and the bipartisan sponsors and co-sponsors of the 
``Citizen Service Act of 2002'' are leading that effort in the House of 
Representatives.
    Programs such as Learn and Serve America, Senior Corps, and 
AmeriCorps offer Americans a variety of ways to help meet important 
community needs through service. Through their hard work on the 
``Citizen Service Act of 2002,'' Chairman Hoekstra<Hoekstra, 
Peter> and Congressman Roemer<Roemer, Tim> are 
helping to strengthen and improve these programs based on the principles 
and reforms I outlined earlier this year. I also look forward to working 
with the Senate and to signing the ``Citizen Service Act of 2002'' this 
legislative session.
