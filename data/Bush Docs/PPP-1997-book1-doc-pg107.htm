Letter to Congressional Leaders and the Chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission Reporting on Radio Frequency Spectrum 
Reallocation
February 4, 1997

Dear __________:
    Title VI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 directs 
the Secretary of Commerce to prepare a report identifying at least 200 
megahertz (MHz) of the radio frequency spectrum for reallocation, over a 
period of 15 years, from Federal Government use to nonfederal Government 
use. This title also directs the President to notify the Federal 
Communications Commission and both Houses of Congress as actions are 
taken under this title. Including the reallocation of the 25 MHz 
reported in this

notice, actions have now been completed to reallocate 120 MHz of 
spectrum for use by nonfederal Government entities.
    Under delegated authority, the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration (NTIA) is responsible for managing the 
Federal Government's use of the radio frequency spectrum. On March 22, 
1995, former Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown submitted to you NTIA's 
Spectrum Reallocation Final Report; this report presented a schedule for 
reallocating specified frequency bands over the period extending to 
January 1999. The NTIA report identified the frequency band 4635-4660 
MHz for reallocation in January 1997.
    I am pleased to inform you that the Federal Government frequency 
assignments in the 4635-4660 MHz frequency band have been withdrawn by 
NTIA in compliance with section 114 of the Act. In addition, appropriate 
modifications have been made to the United States Table of Frequency 
Allocations for Federal Government stations to reflect the completed 
spectrum reallocation actions.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives; Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate; and Reed 
E. Hundt, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
