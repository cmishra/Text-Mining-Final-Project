    President Bush. It's my honor to visit again with my very close

very strong leader who's got a vision that's based upon the principles 
of human dignity and freedom.
    And we'll spend time talking about Iraq. We're both convinced and 
strongly believe that our goals in Iraq are the right goals, and we'll 
accomplished the goals.
    He's a steadfast friend, and I'm so proud to be with you again.
