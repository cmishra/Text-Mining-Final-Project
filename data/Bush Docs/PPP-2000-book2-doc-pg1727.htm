Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Hosni 
Mubarak<Mubarak, Hosni> of Egypt in Cairo
August 29, 2000

Middle East Peace Process

    Q. What do you hope to accomplish in this meeting today, Mr. Mubarak 
and Mr. Clinton?
    President Mubarak. We're going to do our best to find a solution for 
the problem in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinians. We 
are making some consultations so as you could help the two parties to 
reach a framework. It's very important. We hope to finish it by 
September. We want that.
    Q. Are you hopeful, sir?
    President Mubarak. I'm always hopeful. And I think with the 
cooperation with the United States and their support, I think this will 
be reached.
    President Clinton. I think the time is short for resolving this. And 
I think all the parties understand that without the involvement and 
leadership and support of Egypt, they won't be able to do it. President 
Mubarak has been critical to this process for nearly 20 years now, 
certainly in all the time that I've been here. So we're going to work 
together and see if we can find a way to help the parties get over this 
next big hump.

 Note:  The exchange began at 7:10 a.m. at the Presidential Terminal at 
Cairo International Airport. A tape was not available for verification
