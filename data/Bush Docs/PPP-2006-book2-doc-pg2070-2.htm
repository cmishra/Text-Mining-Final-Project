Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Iran
November 9, 2006

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the Iran emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 on November 14, 
1979, is to continue in effect beyond November 14, 2006.
    Our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the 
process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is 
still underway. For these reasons, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue for 1 year the national emergency declared on 
November 14, 1979, with respect to Iran.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 November 9, 2006.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
