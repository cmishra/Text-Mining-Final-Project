Nomination for Commissioner of the Social Security Administration
November 15, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Shirley S. 
Chater, Ph.D., the current Commissioner of Social Security, to head the 
Social Security Administration when it becomes an independent agency 
next year.
    ``In the year since she was sworn in as the current Commissioner, 
Dr. Chater has taken decisive steps to improve service to Americans with 
disabilities, to streamline the agency and make it more efficient, and 
to enact high customer service standards for the more than 49 million 
Americans who receive Social Security or Supplemental Security Income 
benefits,'' the President said. ``I can think of no better person to 
protect and maintain the administration's commitment to Social 
Security.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
