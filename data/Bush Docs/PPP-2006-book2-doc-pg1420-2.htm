Letter to Congressional Leaders on Departure of American Citizens From 
Lebanon
July 18, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Hostilities involving Israeli military forces and Hezbollah 
terrorists in Lebanon commenced on July 12, 2006, and have included 
military operations in the vicinity of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.
    Although there is no evidence that Americans are being directly 
targeted, the security situation has deteriorated and now presents a 
potential threat to American citizens and the U.S. Embassy. On July 14, 
the Department of State first requested Department of Defense assistance 
to support the departure of American citizens from Lebanon. On July 15, 
U.S. military helicopters temporarily deployed to Cyprus. On July 16, 
these combat-equipped helicopters delivered to U.S. Embassy, Beirut, a 
contingent of U.S. military personnel who will assist in planning and 
conducting the departure from Lebanon of U.S. Embassy personnel and 
citizens and designated third country personnel. The helicopters also 
transported U.S. citizens from Beirut to Cyprus. It is expected that 
these helicopters will continue to provide support to the Embassy, 
including for the departure of additional personnel from Lebanon. It is 
likely that additional combat-equipped U.S. military forces may be 
deployed to Lebanon and Cyprus and other locations, as necessary, in 
order to support further efforts to assist in the departure of persons 
from Lebanon and to provide security.
    These actions are being undertaken solely for the purpose of 
protecting American citizens and property. United States forces will 
redeploy as soon as it is determined that the threat to U.S. citizens 
and property has ended and the departure of any persons, as necessary, 
is completed.
    I have taken this action pursuant to my constitutional authority to 
conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander in Chief and Chief 
Executive. I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the 
Congress informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

tempore of the Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the
