Statement on Initiatives To Combat Medicare and Medicaid Fraud
May 3, 1995

    These initiatives are the right way to control health care costs and 
protect Medicare for our senior citizens. They will help ensure that 
Medicare dollars, on which so many of our seniors rely, go to the people 
who deserve them.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
a crackdown on fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid as an outgrowth 
of the effort to reinvent Government.
