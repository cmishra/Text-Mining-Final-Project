Statement on Signing the Investor and Capital Markets Fee Relief Act
January 16, 2002

    Today I signed into law H.R. 1088, the Investor and Capital Markets 
Fee Relief Act. This legislation will provide fee relief to the growing 
number of Americans who have invested in stocks and bonds to save for 
their retirements, their children's education, and other needs. This 
legislation will relieve the 50 percent of American households that now 
own stock, either directly or in pension or mutual funds, from the 
burden of these fees, while ensuring that the SEC has sufficient funding

to carry out its important mission of protecting investors through 
vigorous enforcement of securities laws. I applaud the Congress for 
acting in an overwhelming bipartisan manner in sending this legislation 
to my desk.

Note: H.R. 1088, approved January 16, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
123.
