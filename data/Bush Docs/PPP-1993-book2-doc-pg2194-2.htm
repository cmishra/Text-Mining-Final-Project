Appointment for Assistant to the President for Congressional Affairs
December 20, 1993

    The President announced today that he has appointed Pat Griffin to 
be the Assistant to the President for Congressional Affairs. Mr. 
Griffin, an experienced professional with experience in academia, 
government, and the private sector, will begin work at the White House 
in mid-January.
    ``I am very glad to have someone of Pat Griffin's skill and 
experience leading my legislative team here at the White House,'' said 
the President. ``We have an ambitious agenda on the Hill for the next 
year, with difficult challenges like health care, crime, and welfare 
reform to be addressed. I am counting on Pat to work closely with 
Members on both sides of the aisle to move those issues forward.''

Note: A biography of the appointee was made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
