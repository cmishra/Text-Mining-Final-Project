Remarks on the National Strategy for Homeland Security
July 16, 2002

    Mr. Vice President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> and Governor 
Ridge,<Ridge, Tom<ls-thn-eq> thank you all. I want to thank the Members 
of Congress who have come to discuss the creation of the Department of 
Homeland Security. We just had a really productive meeting on this 
important issue. All of us agree that protecting Americans from attack 
is our most urgent national priority and that we must act on the 
priority.
    I want to thank the Speaker, Speaker Hastert,<Hastert, J. 
Dennis<ls-thn-eq> and Leader Gephardt,<Gephardt, Richard A.<ls-thn-eq> 
as well as Leader Lott<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> and Senator Reid<Reid, 
Harry<ls-thn-eq> for being here. And I appreciate so very much their 
agreement that we ought to have a debate about the creation of the 
Department of Homeland Security on the floor of both bodies before 
Congress leaves for the August break. These four leaders have shown a 
strong commitment to get something done on behalf of the American 
people.
    I also want to appreciate--the members of the House Select Committee 
on Homeland Security are here, Chairman Armey<Armey, Richard 
K.<ls-thn-eq> and Vice Chairman Pelosi<Pelosi, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> and 
other members. Both Republicans and Democrats are charged with 
reconciling the work of numerous House committees who acted this past 
week. They face a significant challenge, but I'm confident they'll meet 
the challenge, because they, too, want to do what's right.
    I also welcome Members of the House and Senate who have been long 
interested in changing the way our Government protects our homeland--
Senator Lieberman<Lieberman, Joseph I.<ls-thn-eq> and Thompson<Thompson, 
Fred<ls-thn-eq> and Collins,<Collins, Susan M.<ls-thn-eq> Congresswomen 
Harman<Harman, Jane<ls-thn-eq> and Tauscher,<Tauscher, Ellen 
O.<ls-thn-eq> and Congressmen Thornberry,<Thornberry, Mac<ls-thn-eq> 
Gibbons,<Gibbons, Jim<ls-thn-eq> Chambliss,<Chambliss, Saxby<ls-thn-eq> 
Portman,<Portman, Rob<ls-thn-eq> and Shays.<Shays, 
Christopher<ls-thn-eq> These are members who had an interest in reform 
prior to September the 11th. They've been working on this issue for a 
long time, and I appreciate their input and their willingness to stay 
involved in the process.
    I want to thank them for their past efforts. The American people 
need to know these Members of Congress are working hard and working long 
hours. And during the next couple of weeks, they'll be working hard to 
get something on the floor of their respective bodies. And that's good, 
and that's good for the American people.
    There are a lot of tough decisions that will be made as we develop 
and discuss and debate how to move forward. But I'm confident that 
Members of both parties and Members of both Chambers know that the 
security of our Nation is the goal. That's the most important thing that 
they'll be focused on, is how best to secure the United States.
    We also understand that the current structure of our Government is a 
patchwork, to put it best, of overlapping responsibilities, and it 
really does hinder our ability to protect the homeland. And so we're 
working with both parties in both Chambers to effect a strategy that 
will make it more likely that not only this administration and this 
Congress can deal with the true threats of the 21st century but, as 
importantly, future administrations and future Congresses will be able 
to deal with the threats that will continue to be directed at a nation 
which loves freedom.
    I--right after the September the 11th attacks, I established the 
Office of Homeland Security in the White House and gave it a critical 
mission: to produce a national strategy for homeland security. And today 
I'm sending to Congress our new National Strategy for Homeland Security. 
This comprehensive plan lays out clear lines of authority and clear 
responsibilities, responsibilities for Federal employees and for 
Governors and mayors and community and business leaders and the American 
citizens.

With a better picture of those responsibilities, all of us can direct 
money and manpower to meet them.
    In the war on terror, the American people are showing tremendous 
strength and great resolve. Our unity is a great weapon in this fight. 
And by acting together to create a new and single Department of Homeland 
Security, we'll be sending the world a signal that the Congress and the 
administration will work together to protect the American people and to 
win this war on terror.
    Again, I want to thank the Members for their hard work. I appreciate 
the long hours that they're putting in. I appreciate their love for 
America and their patriotism during this trying time for our country.
    May God bless the American people, and may God continue to bless 
America.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 9:30 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish 
language transcript of these remarks.
