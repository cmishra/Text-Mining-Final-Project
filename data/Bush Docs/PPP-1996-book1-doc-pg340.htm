Statement on Tax Provisions for United States Troops in Bosnia
February 26, 1996

    Today, in recognition of the sacrifices members of the U.S. Armed 
Forces are making in and around Bosnia, I am asking Congress to extend 
to them a series of special tax rules.
    Historically, these provisions--which include extending the time to 
file returns and certain tax relief for those serving under hostile 
conditions--have been restricted to individuals deployed in ``combat 
zones.'' However, the men and women of today's military confront 
hardships and risks in non-combat missions like the one we have 
undertaken in Bosnia. I believe the law should be extended to cover 
them. I look forward to working with Congress to enact these changes as 
quickly as possible.
