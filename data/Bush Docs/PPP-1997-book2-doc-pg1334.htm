Message on the Observance of Yom Kippur, 1997
October 9, 1997

    Warm greetings to all those observing Yom Kippur.
    On this most solemn of Jewish holy days, Jews across America and 
around the world acknowledge the transgressions of the past year and 
come before God to atone for their sins. It is a time to rectify 
mistakes, to repair broken bonds between family members, friends, and 
neighbors, and to reaffirm their sacred covenant with God. Rich with 
tradition and ritual, observed with strict fasting and devout prayer, 
the Day of Atonement offers the Jewish people a powerful reminder to 
begin the new year by seeking what is most important: the mercy of God 
and the forgiveness of those whom they may have failed.
    As our nation embarks upon a season of renewal and reconciliation, 
Americans of all faiths can learn from the lessons of Yom Kippur. By 
acknowledging the divisions among us and seeking forgiveness from one 
another for past injuries and mistakes, we can strengthen our families, 
communities, and nation and enter the future as a more compassionate and 
united people.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a blessed Yom 
Kippur.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on
