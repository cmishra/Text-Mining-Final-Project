Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on United States Citizens 
Missing in Cyprus
May 22, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with Public Law 103-372, I hereby submit the enclosed 
``Report to Congress on the Investigation of the Whereabouts of the U.S. 
Citizens Who Have Been Missing from Cyprus Since 1974.'' The report was 
prepared by retired Ambassador Robert S. Dillon,<Dillon, Robert 
S.<ls-thn-eq> with significant contribution by former State Department 
Associate Director of Security Edward L. Lee, II.<Lee, Edward L., 
II<ls-thn-eq> Their intensive investigation centered on Cyprus, but it 
followed up leads in the United States, Turkey, Greece, Switzerland, and 
the United Kingdom.
    The investigation led to the recovery of partial remains that were 
identified through DNA testing (done at the Armed Forces Institute of 
Pathology DNA Identification Laboratory) and other evidence as being 
those of one of the missing Americans, Andreas Kassapis.<Kassapis, 
Andreas<ls-thn-eq> The report concludes that Mr. Kassapis was killed 
shortly after his capture in August 1974. The report also concludes 
that, although their remains could not be recovered, the other four 
missing U.S. citizens in all likelihood did not survive the events in 
Cyprus in July and August 1974.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

May 22, 1998.
