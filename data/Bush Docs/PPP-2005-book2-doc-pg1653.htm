Message on the Observance of Eid al-Fitr
November 4, 2005

    I send warm greetings to American Muslims and Muslims around the 
world observing Eid al-Fitr, the Festival of Breaking the Fast.
    Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, a time of prayer, reflection, 
and fasting. It is the holiest month of the Muslim year. To celebrate 
this holiday, many Muslims gather in their homes and mosques to thank 
God for His blessings and His help in keeping the fast. Muslims also 
demonstrate their compassion by reaching out to the less fortunate and 
giving gifts of money or food to help those in need. This year, many 
American Muslims have reached out to the victims of Hurricanes Katrina, 
Rita, and Wilma and to those affected by the devastating earthquake in 
South Asia. Their contributions have been generous and reflect the 
important values shared by all Americans.
    Our Nation is blessed to count many Muslims among our fellow 
citizens. As Americans, we share a commitment to family, a belief in 
God's justice and man's moral responsibility, and hope for a future of 
peace and tolerance.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a joyful 
celebration. Eid Mubarak.

                                                          George W. Bush
