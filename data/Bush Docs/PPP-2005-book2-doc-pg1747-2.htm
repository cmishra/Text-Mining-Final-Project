    Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, thank you for arranging such 
beautiful weather; it's a beautiful day.
    Secondly, thank you for the very frank and candid discussion we just 
had on a range of issues. China is an exciting country, and it's an 
important country. And this visit is a chance for you and me to continue 
a very important relationship.
    I invited the President to come to America as soon as he can. And I 
look forward to welcoming you, Mr. President, in our country, so we can 
continue our dialog on how to make our relations as open and

such a warm opening ceremony. Thank you, sir.
