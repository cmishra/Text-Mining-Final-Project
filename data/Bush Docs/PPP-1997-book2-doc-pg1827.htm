so generously to the Presidential Legal Expense Trust. We also want to 
thank Michael Cardozo,<Cardozo, Michael<ls-thn-eq> the executive 
director of the Trust, the cochairs, Father Theodore Hesburgh<Hesburgh, 
Theodore M.<ls-thn-eq> and Nicholas Katzenbach,<Katzenbach, 
Nicholas<ls-thn-eq> and the other trustees, John Brademas,<Brademas, 
John<ls-thn-eq> Ronald Olson,<Olson, Ronald<ls-thn-eq> Elliot 
Richardson,<Richardson, Elliot<ls-thn-eq> Michael Sovern,<Sovern, 
Michael<ls-thn-eq> John Whitehead,<Whitehead, John<ls-thn-eq> and 
Barbara Jordan,<Jordan, Barbara<ls-thn-eq> who served until her death in 
1996. Hillary and I are immensely grateful for their assistance.
    In light of the trustees' decision to dissolve the Trust, we have 
asked the Counsel's office to advise us concerning the ethical and legal 
requirements that would govern any future efforts to address both the 
substantial legal fees already accumulated and those that will be 
generated by the need for ongoing representation.
