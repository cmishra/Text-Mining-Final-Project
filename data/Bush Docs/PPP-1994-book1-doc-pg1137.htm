Statement on the Death of Airmen at Fairchild Air Force Base
June 24, 1994

    I was profoundly saddened to learn tonight of the tragic aircraft 
accident at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, that took the lives of 
four Air Force officers of the 12th Air Combat Command. The deaths of 
these superb airmen remind us as a nation of the hazardous risks 
involved in maintaining the readiness and proficiency of our Armed 
Forces and the debt we owe our military personnel. Hillary joins me in 
asking all Americans to keep the families of these distinguished Air 
Force officers and all the personnel of the 12th Air Combat Command in 
their prayers.
