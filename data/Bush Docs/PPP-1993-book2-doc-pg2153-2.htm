Appointment for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
December 10, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to appoint three 
individuals, Jerry MacArthur Hultin, Raymond J. McClendon, and James B. 
Nutter, to the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage 
Corporation (Freddie Mac), a stockholder-owned corporation chartered by 
Congress in 1970 which supports home ownership and rental housing 
through the creation and development of a secondary market for 
residential mortgages.
    ``Jerry Hultin, Raymond McClendon, and James Nutter all bring years 
of financial management experience to the task of overseeing the 
important work of Freddie Mac,'' said the President. ``I appreciate 
their willingness to serve.''

Note: Biographies of the appointees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
