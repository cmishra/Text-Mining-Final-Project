Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
May 2, 2001

Budget Agreement

    It's my honor to welcome back to the Cabinet Room leaders in the 
House and the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, who worked hard on 
the budget. There is a budget deal; it's an agreement that makes a lot 
of sense. In the agreement is the largest tax cut in a generation and 
reasonable levels of spending.
    This plan could not have been done without the leadership of the 
Speaker<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> and the leader of the 
Senate,<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> nor could it have been done without two 
really fine budget chairmen, Congressman Nussle<Nussle, Jim<ls-thn-eq> 
and Senator Domenici,<Domenici, Pete V.<ls-thn-eq> both of whom and 
their staffs and their committees worked long, hard hours.
    And finally, it couldn't have been done without the cooperation and 
work of some of our Democrat friends, Breaux<Breaux, John B.<ls-thn-eq> 
in Louisiana and Miller<Miller, Zell<ls-thn-eq> of Georgia, 
Condit<Condit, Gary A.<ls-thn-eq> of California, Members around this 
table, who realized that it's time--it was time to come together to put 
a good budget together on behalf of the American people; Members who 
realize that what we're talking about is not partisan politics but good 
budget politics, good budget policy. They'll always recognize that we're 
here to serve the people, and this is the people's budget. It's a good 
budget for the working people of America, and I'm proud to congratulate 
you all for a job really well done.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 1:10 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
