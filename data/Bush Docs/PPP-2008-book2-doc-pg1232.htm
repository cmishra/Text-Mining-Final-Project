September 23, 2008

    The President. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I and Secretary 
Rice<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> and members of my administration have 
just had a wonderful lunch with democracy leaders, human rights 
activists, courageous men and women who have stood strong for freedom. I 
assured them that this Government--or my Government believes in the 
universality of freedom. We believe there's an Almighty, and a gift of 
that Almighty to every man, woman, and child is freedom.
    They inspire us. Here in America, we have an obligation to help 
others realize the blessings of liberty. They have been on the 
frontlines of securing liberty. And so we want to thank you very much 
for your courage. We thank you for your set of beliefs that remain 
strong. Thank you for taking time to be with us today. And you might 
want to say something.

with the introduction of human rights activist, U Kovida.]
