Statement on the Death of Raisa Gorbacheva<Gorbacheva, Raisa>
September 20, 1999

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Raisa 
Maksimovna Gorbacheva, wife of former Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev.<Gorbachev, Mikhail S.> We extend our deepest 
condolences to her family and friends in Russia and other countries. The 
example she set through her help for child victims of leukemia and 
through her own courageous struggle against this terrible disease was an 
inspiration to people everywhere.
