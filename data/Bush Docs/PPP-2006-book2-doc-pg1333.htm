Remarks Following a Dinner With Mayor Richard M. Daley<Daley, Richard 
M.<ls-thn-eq> of Chicago and Business Leaders in Chicago, Illinois
July 6, 2006

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> said, ``What do you want for your 
birthday?'' I said, ``I want to have dinner in Chicago with the mayor.'' 
[Laughter] Thank you all for joining us. We've had a wonderful 
discussion. Chicago is a fabulous town, Mayor. And you're awfully kind 
to host us here.
    Somebody said, ``Well, what's your birthday wish?'' I've got a lot 
of birthday wishes. I hope our troops are safe. I hope Roger 
Ebert<Ebert, Roger<ls-thn-eq> does well. That's a birthday wish. I know 
a lot of people here in Chicago are praying for him. It's been a heck of 
a birthday party tonight, and I appreciate you all joining me, and 
looking forward to having my cake.
    Thanks for coming.
