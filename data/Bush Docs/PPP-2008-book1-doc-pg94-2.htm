Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Request for Additional Funds for Veterans Resources
January 17, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:
    My Administration is committed to providing the resources needed to 
ensure that veterans, including those returning from current combat 
operations, receive the quality care and services they deserve.
    In the FY 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Public Law 110-161, 
$3,691,391,000 was designated by the Congress as an emergency 
requirement contingent upon a formal budget request by me that includes 
designation of the entire amount as an emergency requirement.

[[Page 95]]

While I believe that these funds should have been considered as regular 
appropriations, the men and women who have sacrificed for our country 
should not be held hostage to budgetary wrangling in Washington. 
Therefore, to provide these funds in a timely manner I hereby request 
and designate as an emergency requirement the $3,691,391,000, consistent 
with Public Law 110-161.
    Additional information on this action is set forth in the enclosed 
letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
