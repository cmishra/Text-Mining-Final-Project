Statement on Senate Confirmation of Tom Ridge<Ridge, Tom> as 
Secretary of Homeland Security
January 22, 2003

    I applaud the Senate for acting quickly and in a strong, bipartisan 
manner to confirm the first Secretary of the Department of Homeland 
Security. With today's historic vote, the Senate has demonstrated our 
shared commitment to doing everything we can to secure our homeland. 
Secretary Ridge is an outstanding and dedicated public servant who 
understands my administration's top priority always will be the 
protection of the American people, and I look forward to continuing to 
work closely with him to fulfill this important responsibility.
