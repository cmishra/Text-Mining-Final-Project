Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Energy Legislation
April 21, 2005

    I commend the House for taking an important step to secure our 
energy future and to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
The House energy legislation is largely consistent with the key 
objectives of my comprehensive national energy policy: increasing 
conservation and efficiency, expanding domestic production in 
environmentally responsible ways, diversifying our energy supply with 
more renewables and clean fuels, and modernizing our energy 
infrastructure. For more than a decade, our Nation has not had a 
sensible, balanced, and comprehensive energy strategy. An energy bill 
will help us make better use of the energy supplies we have and will 
make our supply of energy more affordable and more secure for the 
future. I look forward to swift Senate action so that I can sign a bill 
into law by August.
