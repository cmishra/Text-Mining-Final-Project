Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
March 6, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period December 1, 2000-January 31, 2001. 
The previous submission covered events during October and November 2000.
    The United Nations continued in its efforts to sustain the proximity 
talks that started in December 1999. The United States remains committed 
to the United Nations effort to find a just and lasting settlement to 
the Cyprus problem.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
