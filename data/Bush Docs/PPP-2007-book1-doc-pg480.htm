Statement on the Interagency Task Force on Returning Global War on 
Terror Heroes
April 24, 2007

    The brave men and women who have volunteered to protect and defend 
our country deserve to receive the highest level of support from our 
grateful Nation. Today Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim 
Nicholson<Nicholson, R. James<ls-thn-eq> and members of the Interagency 
Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror Heroes released a 
governmentwide action plan that sets out steps to improve our care for 
America's troops and veterans.
    The task force has proposed specific recommendations to immediately 
begin addressing the problems and gaps in services that were identified 
across the veterans and military healthcare systems. These 
recommendations include directing the Department of Defense and the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to develop a joint process for disability 
determination. Additionally, I have asked Secretary Nicholson<Nicholson, 
R. James<ls-thn-eq> to communicate directly with the members of the 
Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors to ensure 
that both groups exchange ideas and information that will efficiently 
advance reform efforts.
    I commend the work of the task force, welcome its recommendations, 
and have directed Secretary Nicholson<Nicholson, R. James<ls-thn-eq> to 
work with all agencies involved on the recommendations and to report 
back to me within 45 days on how these measures are being implemented.
