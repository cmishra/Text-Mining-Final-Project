President's Health/Visit With Marines

    The President. I just finished two things. One, I had my physical, 
and I'm feeling pretty good. It's a great hospital to come to to get 
your physical.
    But I also visited with some brave marines who have been wounded. 
It's a remarkable experience to meet with these incredibly courageous 
souls who keep their spirit. And I understand why they're serving the 
country. I met with their parents. I met with the healers who work here 
at Bethesda. It's a--it's such a great credit to our country to have a 
place such as this.
    So I want to thank you for having me, and thanks for giving me my 
physical.
    Rear Adm. Robinson.<Robinson, Adam M., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> You're 
welcome, sir.
    The President. Thank you.
    Q. How's your health, sir?
    The President. She's going to put out the return. I think you'll 
find it's pretty good. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:16 p.m. Participating in the visit was 
Rear Adm. Adam M. Robinson, Jr., USN, commander, National Naval Medical 
Center. A tape was not available for verification of the content of
