Remarks on Arrival in Hampton, Virginia
March 4, 2001

    Well, thank you all very much. And thank you for your service to 
this great land of ours. Laura and I are thrilled to be here. I'm 
traveling today with members of my Cabinet: the Secretary of State, 
Colin Powell,<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> and<Powell, Alma<ls-thn-eq>

Abraham,<Abraham, Spencer<ls-thn-eq> and his bride.<Abraham, 
Jane<ls-thn-eq>
    We've assembled the finest national security team of any 
administration. We understand our job is to keep the peace. But we also 
understand in order to do so, our military must be well prepared, well 
trained, well housed, and well paid.
    One of the first policy speeches I gave was to send the message, 
loud and clear, to the U.S. Congress that we expect there to be a pay 
raise for those who wear the uniform. But what you can expect from us is 
a clear mission, a clear, focused mission that says our military will be 
trained and ready to fight and win war and, therefore, prevent war from 
happening in the first place.
    We're honored to be here. Thank you for your service to America. Our 
country and the world is better off for it.
    God bless.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 1 p.m. at Langley Air Force 
Base. In his remarks, he referred to Secretary Powell's wife, Alma; 
Secretary Rumsfeld's wife, Joyce; and Secretary Abraham's wife, Jane. A 
tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
