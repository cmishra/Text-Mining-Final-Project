Nomination for Appeals Court and District Court Judges
November 17, 1993

    The President today nominated Judith Rogers, currently chief judge 
of the DC Court of Appeals, to be U.S. Court of Appeals judge for the 
District of Columbia Circuit. He also nominated attorney Thomas Vanaskie 
to be a U.S. District Court judge for the Middle District of 
Pennsylvania.
    ``I am particularly proud to be making these appointments today. 
Judith Rogers' career has been one of historic firsts, and she will be 
only the second African-American woman ever to serve on a U.S. Court of 
Appeals. I am confident that she will continue the outstanding work she 
has done on Washington's highest court,'' said the President. 
``Likewise, I firmly believe that Thomas Vanaskie will exhibit all the 
qualities of an outstanding jurist on the District Court.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
