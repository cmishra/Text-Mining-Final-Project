Statement on the Situation in Kosovo
January 16, 1999

    I condemn in the strongest possible terms the massacre of civilians 
by Serb security forces that took place last night in the village of 
Racak in Kosovo. This was a deliberate and indiscriminate act of murder 
designed to sow fear among the people of Kosovo. It is a clear violation 
of the commitments Serbian authorities have made to NATO. There can be 
no justification for it.
    The perpetrators must be brought to justice. The Serb authorities 
must act immediately to identify those responsible. They must cooperate 
with the Kosovo Verification Mission and the International War Crime 
Tribunal. They must withdraw security forces, carry out all the 
commitments they have made to NATO, and cease their repression.
    We are in close contact with Secretary-General Solana<Solana, 
Javier> and our NATO allies. Together, we will work to stop 
the repression and prevent an escalation of fighting.
    It is urgent that these murders not trigger a spiral of reprisals. 
Both sides have a responsibility to work towards a peaceful resolution 
of this crisis and for a settlement that allows the people of Kosovo the 
self-government they so clearly deserve.
