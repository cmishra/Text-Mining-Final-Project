Statement on Violence in the Republic of Georgia
October 19, 1998

    I am deeply disturbed by reports of violence in the western part of 
the Republic of Georgia, where heavily armed opposition forces seized 
hostages and clashed with Government troops today.
    The United States strongly supports the democratically elected 
Government of Georgia, headed by President Eduard Shevardnadze, and the 
stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Georgia.
    We are glad that the opposition forces decided late today to release 
their hostages, and we call on the opposition forces to resolve their 
differences with the Government through peaceful and democratic means 
rather than by armed confrontation.
