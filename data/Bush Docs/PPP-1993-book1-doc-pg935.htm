Letter to Congressional Leaders on Trade With Mauritania
June 25, 1993

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    I am writing concerning the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). 
The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for products 
that are imported from developing countries. It is authorized by title V 
of the Trade Act of 1974.
    Pursuant to title V, I have determined that Mauritania no longer 
meets the eligibility requirements set forth in the GSP law. In 
particular, I have determined that it has not taken and is not taking 
steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights. Accordingly, I 
intend to suspend Mauritania indefinitely as a designated beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(a)(2) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
