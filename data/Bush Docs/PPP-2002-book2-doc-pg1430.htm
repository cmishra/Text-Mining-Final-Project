Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
August 20, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration 
on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering 
the period June 1, 2002, through July 31, 2002. The previous submission 
covered events from April 1, 2002, through May 31, 2002.
    Direct talks on the island between Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos 
Clerides<Clerides, Glafcos<ls-thn-eq> and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf 
Denktash<Denktash, Rauf<ls-thn-eq> continue under United Nations 
auspices, although the leaders failed to meet their stated objective of 
a comprehensive settlement by June 2002. As in past reporting periods, 
Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. Weston<Weston, Thomas G.<ls-thn-eq> 
and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald K. Bandler<Bandler, Donald 
K.<ls-thn-eq> provided diplomatic support to the process. The United 
States remains committed to the United Nations effort to find a just and 
lasting settlement to the Cyprus problem.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Joseph R. Biden, Jr., chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office 
of the Press Secretary on August 21.
