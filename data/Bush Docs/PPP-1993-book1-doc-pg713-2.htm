Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Meeting With 
President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan
May 20, 1993

    The President and the Vice President met today at the White House 
with President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan. The President welcomed the 
Kyrgyz leader, noting his bold support of human rights, democracy, and 
market reform in the Kyrgyz Republic. During their talks, the President 
and Vice President discussed a wide range of issues of mutual concern 
with President Akayev and welcomed the expansion of bilateral ties 
between our two countries.
    The U.S. remains committed to assisting the Kyrgyz Republic in its 
difficult transition to a democratic and market-oriented system. The 
President and Vice President congratulated the Kyrgyz leader for being 
the first of the new independent states of the former Soviet Union to 
conclude a stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund to 
promote financial stabilization. They singled out Kyrgyzstan as a model 
for the other new independent states, praising President Akayev for his 
government's bold pursuit of macroeconomic stabilization and democratic 
reform.
