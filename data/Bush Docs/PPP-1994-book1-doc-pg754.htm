    The world is elated at the prospect of these elections. They are the 
next step in South Africa's historic path from apartheid to nonracial 
democracy. Americans have stood by South Africans in their struggle, and 
we will be steadfast in our commitment to work with all South Africans 
to build the prosperous, stable, and just society that can come in its 
place.

    Jesse Jackson, president, Rainbow Coalition, head of delegation;
    George Moose, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs;
