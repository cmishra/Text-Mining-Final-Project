Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
August 30, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with section 13(b) of the International Security 
Assistance Act of 1978, Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period June 1-July 31, 2000. The previous 
submission covered events during April and May 2000.
    The United Nations resumed its efforts to bring about comprehensive 
negotiations between

the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities in Geneva on July 5. 
These proximity talks, which began in December 1999 in New York, are 
continuing. However, as my colleagues at the G-8 Summit in Okinawa and I 
agreed, the two parties need to intensify negotiations in order to bring 
about a just and lasting settlement. The United States remains committed 
to the United Nations process and efforts to bring about a solution 
based upon a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on August 31.
