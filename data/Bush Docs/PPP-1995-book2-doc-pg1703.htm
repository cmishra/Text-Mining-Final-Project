Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Iran
October 31, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency is to continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 1995, to the Federal Register for 
publication. Similar notices have been sent annually to the Congress and 
the Federal Register since November 12, 1980. The most recent notice 
appeared in the Federal Register on November 1, 1994.
    The crisis between the United States and Iran that began in 1979 has 
not been fully resolved. The international tribunal established to 
adjudicate claims of the United States and U.S. nationals against Iran 
and of the Iranian government and Iranian nationals against the United 
States continues to function, and normalization of commercial and 
diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran has not been 
achieved. Indeed, on March 15 of this year, I declared a separate 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act and imposed separate sanctions. By 
Executive Order 12959, these sanctions were significantly augmented. In 
these circumstances, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain 
in force the broad authorities that are in place by virtue of the 
November 14, 1979, declaration of emergency, including the authority to 
block certain property of the Government of Iran, and which are needed 
in the process of implementing the January 1981 agreements with Iran.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

October 31, 1995.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
