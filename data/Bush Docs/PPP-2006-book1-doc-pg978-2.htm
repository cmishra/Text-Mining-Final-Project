Remarks on the Formation of Iraq's Government
May 21, 2006

    The formation of a unity government in Iraq is a new day for the 
millions of Iraqis who want to live in freedom. And the formation of the 
unity Government in Iraq begins a new chapter in our relationship with 
Iraq.
    This morning I called the President,<Talabani, Jalal<ls-thn-eq> the 
Prime Minister,<Maliki, Nuri al-<ls-thn-eq> and the Speaker<Mashhadani, 
Mahmoud al-<ls-thn-eq> to congratulate them on working together to form 
the unity Government. I assured them that the United States will 
continue to assist the Iraqis in the formation of a free country, 
because I fully understand that a free Iraq will be an important ally in 
the waron terror, will serve as a devastating defeat for the terrorists 
and Al Qaida, and will serve as an example for others in the region who 
desire to be free.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:33 a.m. in the Diplomatic Reception Room 
at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to President Jalal 
Talabani, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, and Speaker of the Council of
