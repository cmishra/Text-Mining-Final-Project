Videotaped Remarks on the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
February 21, 2000

    Rising oil prices have brought hardship to many families struggling 
to pay heating bills. I've released $295 million in emergency funds to 
help low income families cope with home heating cost. But many 
struggling families aren't aware they qualify for aid. That's why I've 
asked States to help make sure they reach as many eligible families as 
possible. To find out if you're eligible for help with heating bills, 
contact your State government or call 1-800-735-8004.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 6:30 p.m. 
on February 18 in the Roosevelt Room at the White House for later 
broadcast as a public service announcement. A
