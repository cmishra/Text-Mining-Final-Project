Statement on White House Staff Changes
August 7, 1993

    I appreciate the outstanding work Regina Montoya has done as the 
Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.
    When I asked Regina to join my administration, I knew she was 
sacrificing a great deal to leave a successful legal career and her 
family in Dallas. When she informed me she was contemplating returning 
to Dallas because of the difficulty the commute has placed on her 
family, I was supportive of her decision to reunite her family.
    I applaud her decision and thank her for the hard work and dedicated 
service she gave her country and wish her happiness and success in the 
future. And I look forward to calling on her for her insight in the 
future.
    I am also very pleased that Marcia Hale has agreed to take on this 
new responsibility. Marcia has been a strong team player, a dedicated 
worker, and a valued adviser in her capacity as Director of Scheduling 
and Advance. Her background in State government and experience in 
consensus-building and solving local issues will make her a forceful 
advocate for local and State interests. I look forward to Marcia's 
trusted counsel, analysis, and judgment in this new and exciting 
endeavor.

Note: The White House press release also included statements by Regina 
Montoya and Marcia Hale.
