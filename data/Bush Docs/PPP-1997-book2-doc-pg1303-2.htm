Statement on Signing Legislation Designating the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, Washington Field Office Memorial Building
October 6, 1997

    Today I am pleased to have signed into law H.R. 2443, a bill that 
would designate the new Washington, D.C., field office of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation as the ``Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
Washington Field Office Memorial Building.'' The new building is so 
named in honor of the five FBI agents who have been killed in the line 
of duty while assigned to the FBI's Washington field office: William H. 
Christian, Jr., Martha Dixon Martinez, Michael J. Miller, Anthony 
Palmisano, and Edwin R. Woodriffe.
    Naming the FBI's new field office in honor of these brave and 
courageous FBI employees is a reminder to us all of the difficult and 
dangerous job that FBI agents do--day in and day out.
    In establishing this permanent memorial, we do well to remember--and 
be grateful for--the lives of all Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement personnel who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the 
performance of their duties.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

October 6, 1997.

Note: H.R. 2443, approved October 6, was assigned Public Law No. 105-52.
