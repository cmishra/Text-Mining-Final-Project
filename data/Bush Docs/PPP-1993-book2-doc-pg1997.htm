Statement on the Outcome of the Puerto Rican Referendum
November 15, 1993

    I fully support the determination of the citizens of Puerto Rico to 
continue their commonwealth status.
    I am especially gratified by the high level of participation in 
Sunday's referendum, and I look forward to maintaining the relationship 
of friendship and mutual respect that the United States enjoys with the 
people of Puerto Rico.
