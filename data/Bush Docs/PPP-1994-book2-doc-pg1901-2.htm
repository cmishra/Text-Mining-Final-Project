Remarks on the Economy and an Exchange With Reporters in Kuwait City
October 28, 1994

    The President. As I think you know, we had good news from the home 
front today: Economic growth in the third quarter was at 3.4 percent and 
inflation a very low 1.6 percent. This sustained economic expansion is 
producing jobs--this year, more high-wage jobs than not, more high-wage 
jobs this year than in the previous 5 years combined.
    This is the result of a remarkable partnership between the private 
sector and our policies: the efforts of all of our companies and people 
to be competitive in the global economy, coupled with our determination 
to lower the deficit, increase investment in critical areas, expand 
trade, and aggressively promote United States economic interests all 
around the world.
    I'm very, very encouraged by this. We have growth, better jobs, low 
inflation. That's the right path to be on. That's the path we need to 
continue.

    Q. Mr. President, when do you think you'll make a decision on 
bringing the troops home by Christmas, and how many?
    Mr. President. Well, I will make a decision on that essentially 
based on the facts as they exist. If our military people tell me that 
their

judgment is that we can handle that, then I expect that decision will 
flow in a prompt fashion. But we're going to wait a little while longer 
to make sure we have all the evidence, we know exactly where we are, we 
know what the range of risks are. And we'll make a decision pretty soon.
    Q. Sir, are you feeling a little unplugged from your domestic 
matters here?
    The President. No. No. I haven't been gone long enough to be 
unplugged.

Note: The President spoke at 7:44 p.m. at Bayan Palace. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of these remarks.
