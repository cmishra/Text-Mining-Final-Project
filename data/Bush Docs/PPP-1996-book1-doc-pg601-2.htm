Exchange With Reporters in St. Petersburg
April 19, 1996

    Q. Mr. President, can I ask you--anything you wanted to see in 
particular?
    The President. I saw the Impressionists' paintings; I wanted to see 
them. And I wanted to see the living quarters of Catherine the Great. 
[Laughter]
    Q. How did it compare to yours?
    The President. I like mine just fine. [Laughter]

    Q. [Inaudible]--house, Mr. President?
    The President. Well, she didn't have to run for election. [Laughter]
    Q. Are you going to see the Rembrandts here?
    The President. Perhaps, yes. I love the desks. The thing that 
strikes me is the woodwork. I hadn't counted on seeing all that. You 
ought to go back and see all the secret chambers in the desk back there. 
He put everything he had in there.
    Q. Mr. President, you've seen some religious symbols today that have 
been opened in the last few years to the Russian people. What are your 
thoughts on seeing things that didn't used to be open during the Soviet 
era?
    The President. That's a very good thing, not only making it 
available to the people but also making religious expression legitimate 
again and making it--encouraging and nourishing it. I think it's a real 
sign of the health of the Russian democracy that religion is respected 
and people are free to pursue it and express their honest convictions.

Note: The exchange began at approximately 2:30 p.m. in the White Hall 
Room at the Hermitage Museum. A tape was not available for verification 
of the content of this exchange.
