Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Most-Favored-Nation
Trade Status for Bulgaria
January 29, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:
    On June 3, 1993, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Bulgaria is in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria 
of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This action allowed 
for the continuation of most-favored-nation (MFN) status for Bulgaria 
and certain other activities without the requirement of a waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the 
Congress concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of 
Bulgaria. You will find that the report indicates continued Bulgarian 
compliance with U.S. and international standards in the area of 
emigration policy.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

January 29, 1996.
