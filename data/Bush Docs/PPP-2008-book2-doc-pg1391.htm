Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Dmitry A. Medvedev<Medvedev, 
Dmitry A.<ls-thn-eq> of Russia in Lima
November 22, 2008

    President Bush. It's an interesting moment because I've had a lot of 
meetings with Dmitry and Vladimir Putin.<Putin, Vladimir V.<ls-thn-eq> 
This will be my last meeting as the sitting President with the leader of 
Russia. We've had our agreements; we've had our disagreements. I've 
tried to work hard to make it a cordial relationship though, so that 
when we need to work together we can and when we disagree we're able to 
do so in a way that is respectful to our two nations.
    I thank you for coming by today and appreciate your time.
    President Medvedev. Thank you very much, George. And in general, 
though we do have points of agreements and those points of real 
differences, positions, we are prepared for the continuous work. And I 
view that, in general, our work was successful.
    President Bush. Thank--[laughter].

[At this point, President Bush's remarks were translated by an 
interpreter.]

    President Bush. Thank you. Spasibo.

Note: The President spoke at 5:34 p.m. at the JW Marriott Hotel Lima. In 
his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. 
President Medvedev spoke in Russian, and his remarks were translated by 
an interpreter.
