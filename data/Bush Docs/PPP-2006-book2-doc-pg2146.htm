Remarks at the Children's Holiday Reception
December 4, 2006

    Thanks for coming. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I want to 
welcome you all to the White House. We're really happy you're here. I 
think you're going to really enjoy this special occasion. My job is to 
introduce my wife, Laura Bush. [Laughter] Before I do so, though, I want 
to say something about your moms and dads. I thank you very much for 
supporting your mom and dad as they're on a very important mission for 
our country. I want you to know that they love you dearly, and the 
American people love and respect those who wear our uniform a lot.
    I know it's tough to have your mom or dad overseas, and we wish you 
all the best. But it's really important work. And so we wanted to 
welcome you here to the White House to, first of all, thank you for your 
strength, and so that you would do me a favor and e-mail your mom or dad 
who is overseas how much the Commander in Chief respects them, admires 
them, and supports them.

    So welcome to the White House. We're glad you're here. And now I'm 
going to introduce my wife, Laura Bush.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq>

Note: The President spoke at 10:40 a.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also 
included the remarks of the First Lady.
