Remarks to Reporters at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, 
Maryland
August 1, 2006

    The President. I'm just amazed at the health care here at Bethesda. 
The Admiral<Robinson, Adam M., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> runs an amazing operation. 
And it's really important for our citizens to know that if one of our 
men and women get hurt on the battlefield, they're going to get 
incredibly good health care.
    And, Admiral,<Robinson, Adam M., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> I can't thank you 
and your staff enough for serving the country with great dignity and 
class.
    Rear Adm. Robinson.<Robinson, Adam M., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Thank you very 
much.
    The President. Appreciate being here. God bless. Thank you.
    I'm doing fine; my health is fine. I probably ate too many birthday 
cakes.

Note: The President spoke at 1:40 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Rear Adm. Adam M. Robinson, Jr., USN, commander, National Naval Medical 
Center, and chief, Navy Medical Corps.
