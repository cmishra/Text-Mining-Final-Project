Remarks on Departure for Kiev, Ukraine
March 31, 2008

    Good morning. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are on our way to a 
very important NATO summit, and Members of the United States Congress 
are on their way back to Washington. And they have a lot of work to do.
    Congress needs to pass FISA reform. Our intelligence professionals 
are waiting on the Congress to give them the tools they need to monitor 
terrorist communications. Congress also needs to provide liability 
protection to companies that may have helped save lives after September 
the 11th, 2001.
    Congress needs to pass legislation to modernize the Federal Housing 
Administration. Struggling homeowners are waiting on Congress to act, so 
that the FHA can help more Americans refinance their mortgages and stay 
in their homes.
    Congress needs to act urgently to approve the Colombian free trade 
agreement. A courageous ally in South America is waiting on Congress to 
approve an agreement that will strengthen our national security. 
American businesses, workers, and farmers are waiting on Congress to 
level the playing field.
    These are all vital priorities. And I ask members of both parties to 
get these important pieces of legislation to my desk as soon as 
possible.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 6:56 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House.
