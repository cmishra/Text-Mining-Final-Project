Statement on the Death of Marlon Brando<Brando, Marlon<ls-thn-eq>
July 2, 2004

    With the passing of Marlon Brando, America has lost a great actor of 
the stage and screen. His award-winning performances in films such as 
``On the Waterfront'' and ``The Godfather'' demonstrated his outstanding 
talent and entertained millions across the country. Marlon Brando was 
one of the 20th century's finest actors and will be missed by his many 
fans and admirers. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our prayers 
and condolences to his family and friends.
