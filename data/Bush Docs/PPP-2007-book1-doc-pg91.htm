Remarks Prior to a Meeting on Childhood Obesity
February 1, 2007

    The President. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are so pleased to 
welcome the Ad Council, as well as leaders from our business community, 
to talk about a serious American problem, and that is childhood obesity.
    Childhood obesity is a costly problem for the country. It puts 
stress on American families. And we believe it is necessary to come up 
with a coherent strategy to help folks all throughout our society cope 
with the issue. And I appreciate the Secretary<Leavitt, Michael 
O.<ls-thn-eq> being here. Thanks for coming, Mr. Secretary.
    We'll discuss--one of the strategies is to have the Ad Council put 
on an interesting series of ads encouraging children to exercise. One 
way for this Nation to cope with the issue of obesity is to get people 
outside, whether it be through sports or hiking or conservation. So 
we'll encourage them to do that, encourage parents to encourage their 
children to participate in the great outdoors. We'll also talk about 
healthy diet choices here.
    And so I want to thank you all for coming. It's a serious issue that 
we take seriously here at the Government.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> is off to New York to kick off the 
program to help deal with heart disease here. And you might want to say 
a few words.
