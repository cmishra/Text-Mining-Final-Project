Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Weapons-Usable Fissile Material in the Russian Federation
June 19, 2006

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the emergency declared with respect to the accumulation of a large 
volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the 
Russian Federation is to continue beyond June 21, 2006. The most recent 
notice continuing this emergency was published in the Federal Register 
on June 20, 2005 (70 FR 35507).
    It remains a major national security goal of the United States to 
ensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons 
pursuant to various arms control

and disarmament agreements is dedicated to peaceful uses, subject to 
transparency measures, and protected from diversion to activities of 
proliferation concern. The accumulation of a large volume of weapons-
usable fissile material in the territory of the Russian Federation 
continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, I 
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency 
declared with respect to the accumulation of a large volume of weapons-
usable fissile material in the territory of the Russian Federation and 
maintain in force these emergency authorities to respond to this threat.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 June 19, 2006.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
