Statement on the Death of Paul Simon<Simon, Paul<ls-thn-eq>
December 10, 2003

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I were saddened to learn of the 
death of former Senator Paul Simon. Paul Simon contributed significantly 
to America as an Army special agent, newspaper publisher, Member of the 
United States Senate and House of Representatives, and author and 
teacher. He will be missed by the many people in Illinois and throughout 
the country whose lives he touched and improved. Laura and I send our 
condolences to his family and many friends.
