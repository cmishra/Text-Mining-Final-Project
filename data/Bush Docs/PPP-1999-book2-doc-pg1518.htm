Message to the Senate Transmitting the Convention Concerning Safety and 
Health in Mines
September 9, 1999

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification of the Convention (No. 176) Concerning Safety and Health in 
Mines, adopted by the International Labor Conference at its 82nd Session 
in Geneva on June 22, 1995, I transmit herewith a certified copy of that 
Convention.
    The report of the Department of State, with a letter from the 
Secretary of Labor, concerning the Convention is enclosed.
    As explained more fully in the enclosed letter from the Secretary of 
Labor, current United States law and practice fully satisfies the 
requirements of Convention No. 176. Ratification of this Convention, 
therefore, would not require the United States to alter in any way its 
law or practice in this field.
    Ratification of additional ILO conventions will enhance the ability 
of the United States to take other governments to task for failing to 
comply with the ILO instruments they have ratified. I recommend that the 
Senate give its advice and consent to the ratification of ILO Convention 
No. 176.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

September 9, 1999.
