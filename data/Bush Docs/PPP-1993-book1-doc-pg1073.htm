Nomination for Resolution Trust Corporation Chief Executive Officer
July 13, 1993

    The President announced today that he will nominate Florida 
businessman Stanley Tate to be the Chief Executive Officer of the 
Resolution Trust Corporation.
    ``Under the leadership of Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman we 
have instituted a program of reforming RTC's operations that is already 
beginning to take hold,'' said the President. ``With his deep 
understanding of real estate markets and abiding commitment to public 
service, Stanley Tate will continue that process of saving the taxpayers 
money.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
