Nomination for Deputy Director for Management at the Office of 
Management and Budget
February 19, 1993

    The President today appointed Phil Lader, a South Carolina 
businessman and educator, to be the Office of Management and Budget's 
Deputy Director for Management. As the senior administration official 
directly responsible for cutting waste and inefficiency in Government 
operations, Lader will play a key role in the President's efforts to 
reinvent Government.
    ``We must streamline the operations of the Federal Government,'' 
said President Clinton. ``We must squeeze every penny that we have out 
of the Government before we ask ordinary Americans to contribute to 
deficit reduction. Phil Lader has my complete confidence. I trust his 
ability to find every way possible to carry out my mandate of slashing 
the executive costs of Government.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
