Remarks on the Nomination of Congressman James A. Nussle<Nussle, James 
A.<ls-thn-eq> To Be Director of the Office of Management and Budget
June 19, 2007

    The President. Good afternoon. Welcome to the White House. I am here 
to say goodbye to a good friend and introduce the newest nominee to my 
Cabinet. Recently Rob Portman<Portman, Robert Jones<ls-thn-eq> came and 
told me that after 14 years of public service in Washington, he's ready 
to head home to be with Jane<Portman, Jane<ls-thn-eq> and the family. 
I've known him for many years. There's no finer man in public service 
than Rob Portman. He's been a trusted adviser, and Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I am going to miss him.
    Fortunately, we found a good man to succeed him. Today I'm pleased 
to announce my nomination of Jim Nussle to serve as Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget.
    I'm proud to welcome Jim's wife Karen,<Chiccehitto, Karen<ls-thn-eq> 
his mom and dad, Lori<Nussle, Lori<ls-thn-eq> and Mark;<Nussle, 
Mark<ls-thn-eq> and his mother-in-law Eva Mae.<Chiccehitto, Eva 
Mae<ls-thn-eq> Any man who invites his mother-in-law to a--[laughter]--
has got to have good judgment. [Laughter] We're going to ask a lot of 
Jim, and I thank you all for supporting him in this.
    The job of OMB Director is one of the most important in our Federal 
Government. The Director has a central responsibility for implementing 
the full range of my administration's agenda, from defense programs that 
will keep the American people safe to energy initiatives that will break 
our dependence on foreign oil to tax policies that keep our economy 
growing and creating jobs.
    In all these areas, the OMB Director works to ensure that the 
American people get good value for every tax dollar they send to 
Washington. Jim Nussle is the right man to take on these challenges. For 
16 years, Jim represented the people of northeast Iowa in the United 
States Congress. As a Member of Congress, Jim was a strong advocate for 
fiscal discipline and a champion of tax cuts that allowed the American 
people to keep more of what they earn. In 2001, Jim became chairman of 
the House Budget Committee. As a leader in Congress, Jim showed he can 
work with Members of both sides of the aisle to get positive things done 
for America. Jim's name and knowledge command respect on Capitol Hill. 
And as OMB Director, he will use his expertise about the budget process 
to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent with respect and with 
restraint.
    In his new post, Jim will continue the important work carried out by 
Rob Portman.<Portman, Robert Jones<ls-thn-eq> Over the past 2 years, Rob 
has served my administration in two important jobs. As the United States 
Trade Representative, Rob negotiated several new trade agreements and 
reenergized the Doha talks at the World Trade Organization.
    And as OMB Director, he<Portman, Robert Jones<ls-thn-eq> helped me 
achieve our goal of cutting the Federal deficit in half and doing it 3 
years ahead of schedule. He's helped me put forward a plan to balance 
the budget by 2012 by restraining Federal spending and keeping our taxes 
low. He's put Democratic leaders in Congress on notice that I will veto 
bills with excessive levels of spending. He has led my administration's 
efforts to curb the use of congressional earmarks and implement reforms 
that will make the earmark process more transparent.

    I thank Rob<Portman, Robert Jones<ls-thn-eq> for his service and 
good advice and, most of all, his friendship. I want to tell his wife 
Jane,<Portman, Jane<ls-thn-eq> that after 14 years of commuting to 
Washington, he's going to be back home in Ohio, especially on the 
weekends.
    Rob<Portman, Robert Jones<ls-thn-eq> is a tough act to follow, but 
that's why I picked Jim Nussle. He's a man of integrity, a man of 
vision, a man well qualified to hold this job. I ask the Senate to act 
quickly on his nomination. When confirmed, he'll make an outstanding OMB 
Director.
    Congratulations to you.

[Office of Management and Budget Director Robert J. Portman made brief

Note: The President spoke at 2:49 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the
