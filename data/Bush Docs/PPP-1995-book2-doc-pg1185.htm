Statement on Oil and Gas Drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf
July 31, 1995

    The Government today has reached an agreement protecting sensitive 
coastal areas off Florida and Alaska from oil drilling, which has been 
prohibited since 1988, through Democratic and Republican Presidencies.
    Concern for our coasts is part of the common ground we share as 
Americans, not only in the areas protected today but in places as

damaged--beaches, the fishing industry, tourism--our natural heritage 
suffers greatly.
    This settlement is good for the environment, good for taxpayers,

    I am pleased that Secretary Babbitt and Attorney General Reno 
reached this agreement with the oil companies. We celebrate today with 
the citizens of Florida and Alaska, and I pledge continued protection of 
our coasts.
