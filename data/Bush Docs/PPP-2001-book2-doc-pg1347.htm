Statement on Signing the Military Construction Appropriations Act, 2002
November 5, 2001

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2904, the ``Military Construction 
Appropriations Act, 2002,'' which provides $10.5 billion for military 
construction and family housing programs administered by the Department 
of Defense.
    I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this 
Act. The Act abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for 
Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion and funds the vast majority of my 
request for military construction projects, the military housing 
program, and other projects for our military personnel and their 
families. The requested projects are critical to supporting military 
readiness and the quality of life for our soldiers. My Administration 
showed its commitment to improving the quality of housing available to 
our military personnel and their families by including an additional 
$400 million in the FY 2002 Budget. I want to thank the Congress for 
including it in this bill. However, I am disappointed that the bill 
includes a 1.127 percent general reduction, and a rescission of $55 
million from the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
    As America battles terrorism, we must ensure that our men and women 
in uniform live in, train at, and deploy from adequate facilities. This 
bill shows our commitment to our service members by constructing and 
upgrading military installations, and military family housing in the 
United States and overseas.
    My Administration appreciates that the Congress has worked 
expeditiously during this difficult and trying time in our Nation's 
history to consider the FY 2002 appropriations bills. Now, through a 
renewed sense of bipartisanship, the Congress and my Administration must 
work together to ensure the timely enactment of the remaining bills.

                                                          George W. Bush

The White House,

November 5, 2001.

Note: H.R. 2904, approved November 5, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
64.
