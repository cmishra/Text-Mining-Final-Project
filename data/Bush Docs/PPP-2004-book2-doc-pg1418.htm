Statement on Progress in Homeownership
July 29, 2004

    My administration has put forward an aggressive agenda to help all 
Americans--especially first-time homeowners, low-income families, and 
minorities--achieve the dream of owning their own home. Today's 
homeownership statistics show that we are making significant progress in 
building an ownership society in America. We have set a new record for 
homeownership, and today, more Americans, including minorities, own 
their own home than ever before. We will continue to usher in a new era 
of ownership by providing additional opportunities for all Americans to 
realize the American Dream.
