Statement on the Death of John Stanford
November 30, 1998

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of General 
John Stanford. His life was marked by bravery and dedicated to the 
service of his country. From Vietnam to the Pentagon to the public 
school classrooms of Seattle, America is lucky to have been blessed by 
General Stanford's leadership, compassion, and vision. After 30 years of 
military service, the general brought his own infectious brand of 
courage and optimism to a new battle. He streamlined and reinvigorated 
Seattle's schools, inspiring his students to strive for excellence and 
an entire community to believe once again in their public schools. Our 
thoughts and prayers go to his wife, Patricia, their sons, Steven and 
Scott, and the students, teachers, and schools of Seattle.
