Statement on Assistance To Support Efforts To Stabilize the Situation in 
Sierra Leone
May 19, 2000

    I have authorized the Department of Defense to provide up to $20 
million in defense goods and services to support efforts by the United 
Nations and other international forces to stabilize the situation in 
Sierra Leone. This assistance, which we will provide on a 
nonreimbursable basis, will include military transport, supplies, 
equipment, and services, so the international community has the 
capabilities it urgently needs.
    Our African and other partners have taken a stand to restore peace 
and hope to Sierra Leone; we will stand with them. Sierra Leone's people 
have suffered far too much for far too long, and they need immediate 
assistance to prevent a return to full-scale civil war. We have a 
genuine opportunity to make a difference, to give them a chance for a 
better future, and to aid the cause of stability and democracy in 
Africa. We will do what is necessary for Sierra Leone so the 
international community can get the job done.
