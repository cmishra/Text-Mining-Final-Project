Message to the Senate on Ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol of 
the Convention on Conventional Weapons
May 24, 1999

To the Senate of the United States:
    I am gratified that the United States Senate has given its advice 
and consent to the ratification of the Amended Mines Protocol of the 
Convention on Conventional Weapons.
    The Senate and my Administration, working together, reached 
agreement on a detailed resolution of advice and consent to 
ratification, including 13 conditions covering issues of significant 
interest and concern. I will implement these provisions. I will, of 
course, do so without prejudice to my Constitutional authorities. A 
condition in a resolution of advice and consent to ratification cannot 
alter the allocation of authority and responsibility under the 
Constitution, for both the Congress and the President.
    I am grateful to Majority Leader Lott,<Lott, Trent> 
Minority Leader Daschle,<Daschle, Thomas A.> and Senators 
Helms,<Helms, Jesse> Biden,<Biden, Joseph R., Jr.> 
Leahy,<Leahy, Patrick J.> and the many others who have 
assisted in this ratification effort. It is clear that the practical 
result of our work together on the Protocol will well serve the critical 
humanitarian interest of protecting civilians from the dangers posed to 
them by landmines, as well as the imperative requirements of ensuring 
the safety and effectiveness of U.S. military forces. In this spirit, I 
express my hope that the Protocol will lead to further sound advances in 
the development of the international law of armed conflict.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

May 24, 1999.
