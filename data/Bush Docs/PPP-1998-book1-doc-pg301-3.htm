Statement Announcing Grants Under the Violence Against Women Program
February 27, 1998

    Today the Justice Department is awarding more than $135 million in 
grants under the Violence Against Women program to help State and local 
authorities combat domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault. This 
money will be used to train police, hire prosecutors, and provide 
assistance to victims. Since I signed the Crime Act in 1994, we have 
begun to transform the way law enforcement deals with domestic violence. 
We should be proud of the efforts underway in communities across our 
Nation to stop these serious crimes. These funds will help every State 
build and expand on the programs they have developed to ensure that 
abusers are captured, prosecuted, and punished.
