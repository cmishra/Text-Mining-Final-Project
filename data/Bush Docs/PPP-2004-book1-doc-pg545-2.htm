Statement on the 10th Anniversary of the 1994 Rwanda Genocide
April 7, 2004

    Ten years ago today, the world witnessed the beginning of one of the 
most horrific episodes of the 20th century, the 1994 Rwanda genocide. A 
100-day campaign waged by Hutu extremists tore Rwanda apart and resulted 
in the murder of at least 800,000 Tutsi men, women, and children, as 
well as many moderate Hutus. This genocide also included systematic rape 
and sexual violence against countless Tutsi women and the orphaning of 
thousands of children.
    The United States supports the people of Rwanda as they commemorate 
this horrific chapter in history. We urge all states, particularly those 
in the region, to work with Rwanda and the International Criminal 
Tribunal for Rwanda to bring to justice those responsible for the 
genocide and to repatriate the thousands of displaced Rwandans. We also 
urge the international community to assist the survivors of that great 
crime as they continue to heal. The United States will continue to 
assist Rwanda in the unification of families, the providing of 
scholarships, the combating of HIV/AIDS, and the promotion of the rule 
of law.
    The United States joins Rwanda and members of the global community 
in this day of reflection.
