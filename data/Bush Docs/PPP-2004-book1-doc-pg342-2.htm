Message to the Congress Transmitting a Notice of Intention To Enter Into 
a Free Trade Agreement With Morocco
March 8, 2004

To the Congress of the United States:
    Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002 
(Public Law 107-210; the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the 
Congress of my intent to enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with 
the Kingdom of Morocco.
    This agreement will create new opportunities for America's workers, 
farmers, businesses, and consumers by eliminating barriers in trade with 
Morocco. Morocco is one of the United States strongest friends in the 
Middle East. Increased trade will benefit Americans and help strengthen 
a tolerant, open, and more prosperous Morocco. Entering into an FTA with 
Morocco will not only strengthen our bilateral ties with this important 
ally, it will also advance my goal of a Middle East free trade area 
(MEFTA) within a decade.

    Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at 
least 90 days in advance of signing the United States-Morocco FTA. My 
Administration looks forward to working with the Congress in developing 
appropriate legislation to approve and implement this free trade 
agreement.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 March 8, 2004.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
