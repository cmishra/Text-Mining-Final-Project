    I am pleased to nominate Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, United States Air 
Force, to be Commander in Chief, United States Space Command; Commander 
in Chief, North American Aerospace Defense Command; Commander, Air Force 
Space Command; and Department of Defense Manager for Space 
Transportation Systems Contingency Support. If confirmed by the Senate, 
General Eberhart will succeed Gen. Richard B. Myers.<Myers, Richard 
B.>
    General Eberhart currently serves as the Commander of the Air Combat 
Command. Over a distinguished career, General Eberhart has gained 
extensive operational and planning experience and demonstrated 
tremendous leadership ability. A Command Pilot, he commanded the 10th 
Tactical Fighter Squadron, the 363d Tactical Fighter Wing, U.S. Forces 
Japan, and the 5th Air Force, as well as Air Combat Command. His broad 
professional experience also includes significant tours on the Joint 
Staff and Air Staff in the Pentagon and on the staff of Commander in 
Chief, U.S. Air Forces, Europe.
    General Eberhart assumes the post of Commander in Chief, United 
States Space Command, at a time when U.S. capabilities in space have 
become critical to our economic prosperity, our position of leadership 
in the world, and our national security. He will be charged with 
protecting and extending those capabilities, and as well as taking on 
new responsibilities for information operations. I have the utmost trust 
and confidence in his ability to do so.
