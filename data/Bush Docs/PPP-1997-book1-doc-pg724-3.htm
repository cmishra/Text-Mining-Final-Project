Statement on Signing Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Legislation
June 12, 1997

    I am pleased to sign into law tonight the disaster relief bill that 
Congress has just sent to me.
    This bill provides the desperately needed resources for hundreds of 
thousands of people who have suffered terribly from the flooding and 
other natural disasters in the Dakotas, Minnesota, California, and 29 
other States. It also includes the necessary funds for the Department of 
Defense in connection with our peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia and 
Southwest Asia. It does not include the unacceptable political 
provisions of the bill I vetoed that had nothing to do with the goal of 
providing disaster relief.
    When our people are in need, we Americans come to their assistance 
as one nation. I applaud the Congress for heeding my call to remember 
that fundamental principle.

Note: H.R. 1871, 1997 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for 
Recovery from Natural Disasters, and for Overseas Peacekeeping Efforts, 
Including Those in Bosnia, approved June 12, was assigned Public Law No. 
105-18.
