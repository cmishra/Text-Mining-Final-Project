Statement on Federal Election Commission Action on Campaign Finance 
Reform
February 3, 1998

    I strongly support action to end the soft money raised by both 
political parties. That is why last year I asked the Federal Election 
Commission to ban soft money, under its current legal authority. I am 
very pleased that the agency's General Counsel<Noble, Lawrence 
M.<ls-thn-eq> has proposed a new rule prohibiting national parties from 
raising soft money. Now I ask the members of the Commission to step up 
to their responsibility and act, within their legal authority, to end 
the soft money system.
