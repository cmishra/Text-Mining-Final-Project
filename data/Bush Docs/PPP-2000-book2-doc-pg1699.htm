Statement on Action To Support Firefighters Combating Wildfires
August 25, 2000

    The wildfire season this year is one of the worst our Nation has 
ever witnessed. We have marshaled our Federal resources so that the men 
and women fighting these blazes will have the tools they need to safely 
and effectively combat the spread of wildfires throughout the United 
States. Our Federal firefighters and management personnel are working 
under extremely dangerous conditions to protect the public and our lands 
from the threat of these wildfires.
    Today I am announcing that the Departments of the Interior and 
Agriculture, in conjunction with the Office of Personnel Management, 
will take immediate steps to make available as many as 2,000 Federal 
personnel for vital management and supervisory positions to support our 
firefighting efforts. Additional managers and supervisors are needed to 
ensure additional firefighting crews have the proper supervision and 
management support that they need in the field. This action will 
immediately authorize individuals working long, stressful hours to be 
compensated appropriately. Our Nation owes a great debt of gratitude to 
these firefighters, managers, and their loved ones who sacrifice their 
energy and risk their lives in service to their country. It is our 
responsibility, in turn, to do all we can to protect and support them.
