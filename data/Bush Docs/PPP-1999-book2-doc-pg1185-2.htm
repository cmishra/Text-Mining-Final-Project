Statement on the Death of James L. Farmer<Farmer, James L.>
July 10, 1999

    Hillary and I were greatly saddened to learn of the death of James 
Farmer, one of this century's pioneers for freedom. As the leader of the 
Congress of Racial Equality, he stood on the frontlines of the struggle 
for justice. At historic sit-ins, freedom rides, and countless picket 
lines, thousands of citizens risked their lives on behalf of basic 
rights, led by the inspiration of James Farmer. Their effort changed 
America. Through a long career as an activist, public servant, and 
educator, he never lost sight of the shining goal of integration and 
racial equality. He never stopped working to build one America. I was 
privileged to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom last year. 
James Farmer helped to make America a better nation. Our thoughts and 
prayers go out to his family and many friends.
