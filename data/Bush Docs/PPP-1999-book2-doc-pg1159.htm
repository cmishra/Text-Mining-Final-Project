Statement on the Sierra Leone Peace Agreement
July 7, 1999

    On behalf of all Americans, I congratulate President Ahmed Tejan 
Kabbah<Kabbah, Ahmed Tejan> and Revolutionary United Front 
leader Foday Sankoh<Sankoh, Foday> on the signing of a peace 
agreement today in Lome, Togo. The agreement offers the hope of ending 
nearly 8 years of terrible conflict in Sierra Leone and bringing peace 
and a brighter future for its people.
    I thank President Eyadema<Eyadema, Gnassingbe> and the 
Government of Togo for hosting the peace talks, and the Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Organization of African 
Unity (OAU), the U.N., and my Special Envoy, Reverend Jesse 
Jackson,<Jackson, Jesse> for providing critical support to the 
peace process. Neighboring countries also provided refuge to hundreds of 
thousands of Sierra Leoneans who fled the conflict and atrocities in 
their country. Their willingness to open their arms to those in need is 
an example that inspires us all.
    We are committed to working with ECOWAS, the U.N., and the OAU to 
ensure appropriate support for implementing the agreement and beginning 
reconciliation efforts. We will work with the people of Sierra Leone and 
the international community to support the safe return of more than one 
million refugees and internally displaced people and the reconstruction 
of the country.

Note: The statement referred to President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and 
civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.
