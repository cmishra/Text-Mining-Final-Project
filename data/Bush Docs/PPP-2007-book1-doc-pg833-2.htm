Statement on the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement
June 30, 2007

    I am pleased that United States Trade Representative Susan C. 
Schwab<Schwab, Susan C.<ls-thn-eq> and Republic of Korea Trade Minister 
Kim Hyun-chong<Kim Hyun-chong<ls-thn-eq> today signed the United States-
Korea Free Trade Agreement. This agreement will generate export 
opportunities for U.S. farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and service 
suppliers, promote economic growth and the creation of better paying 
jobs in the United States, and help American consumers save money while 
offering them greater choices. The agreement will also further enhance 
the strong United States-Korea partnership, which has served as a force 
for stability and prosperity in Asia. I call on Congress to ratify this 
landmark agreement, to the considerable benefit of the American people.
