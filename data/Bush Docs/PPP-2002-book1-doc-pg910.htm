Statement Announcing Actions To Preserve Florida's Natural Resources
May 29, 2002

    Florida is known worldwide for its beautiful coastal waters and the 
Everglades. Today we are acting to preserve both. Florida is also known 
for its strong commitment to preserving these extraordinary natural 
resources, and the Federal Government is a strong partner in those 
efforts.
    Today I am extremely pleased to announce two historic actions in the 
State of Florida that exemplify personal stewardship and conservation 
partnerships. The United States Government will buy back the rights for 
natural gas and oil development in Destin Dome and in critical parts of 
the Everglades.
    These are important steps in preserving some of our Nation's most 
beautiful natural treasures, including Big Cypress National Preserve, 
the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge, and the Ten Thousand 
Islands National Wildlife Refuge. Today's action once again demonstrates 
that my administration will take seriously the views of local 
communities. The Federal Government should continue to work closely with 
States and local communities in solving issues that affect energy 
security, the economy, and the environment.
    I appreciate the good work of Secretary Norton<Norton, Gale 
A.> and the staff of the Department of the Interior, Governor 
Bush<Bush, Jeb> and his team, the Collier family, and the 
private sector companies whose hard work has made these agreements 
possible. They have contributed greatly to our shared mission of 
sustained stewardship of these extraordinary natural areas.
