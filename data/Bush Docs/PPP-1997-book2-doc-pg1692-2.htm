Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Line Item Veto of the 
Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act, 1998
December 2, 1997

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the 
dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the 
attached report, contained in the ``Departments of Commerce, Justice, 
and State, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998'' (H.R. 2267). 
I have determined that the cancellation of this amount will reduce the 
Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government 
functions, and will not harm the national interest. This letter, 
together with its attachment, constitutes a special message under 
section 1022 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
1974, as amended.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
report detailing the cancellation was published in the Federal Register 
on December 3. H.R. 2267, approved November 26, was assigned Public Law 
No. 105-119.
