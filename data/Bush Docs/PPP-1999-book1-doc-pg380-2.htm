Statement on the Killing of Rosemary Nelson<Nelson, Rosemary> 
in Northern Ireland
March 15, 1999

    The killing today of Rosemary Nelson, a leading human rights lawyer 
in Northern Ireland, was a despicable and cowardly act by the enemies of 
peace. Our deepest sympathies go out to her family and friends. It is 
long past time for the bloodshed to end once and for all. We urge all 
the proponents for peace to unite to condemn this act and reject the 
violence. We urge the parties to move forward with implementing the Good 
Friday accord.
