Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments for Fiscal Year 2003
March 14, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for FY 2003 
budget amendments for the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Labor, 
Transportation, and the Treasury; the Environmental Protection Agency; 
and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The discretionary budget 
authority proposed in my FY 2003 Budget would not be increased by these 
requests. However, the total budgetary resources available to the 
Department of Transportation would increase by $596 million.
    This transmittal also contains FY 2003 budget amendments for the 
Legislative Branch. As a matter of comity, appropriations requests of 
the Legislative Branch are transmitted without change. These additional 
amendments would increase discretionary resources for the Legislative 
Branch by $40.4 million.
    The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
March 15. An original was not available for the verification of the 
content of this letter.
