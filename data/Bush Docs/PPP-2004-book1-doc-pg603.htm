Remarks Announcing the Nomination of John D. Negroponte<Negroponte, John 
D.<ls-thn-eq> To Be Ambassador to Iraq
April 19, 2004

    The President. Today I'm announcing my intention to nominate 
Ambassador John Negroponte as the Ambassador to Iraq. Ambassador 
Negroponte now serves our Nation at the United Nations as the Ambassador 
there. He has done a really good job of speaking for the United States 
to the world about our intentions to spread freedom and peace. John 
Negroponte is a man of enormous experience and skill. Therefore, I'm 
comfortable in asking him to serve in this very difficult assignment. No 
doubt in my mind he can handle it. No doubt in my mind he'll do a very 
good job. And there's no doubt in my mind that Iraq will be free and 
democratic and peaceful.
    So, John, thank you for agreeing to serve your country yet once 
again. I'm proud of your service. Good luck to you. Thank you.
    Ambassador Negroponte. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank 
you.
    The President. You bet.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 1:51 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House.
