Remarks on Arrival in Little Rock, Arkansas
January 2, 1995

    Hello. I want to thank you so much for coming out to see us. It's 
wonderful to be home. We're looking forward just to spending some 
personal time visiting with our friends, saying hello to people, driving 
around the State a little bit. And I'm even going to have a few hours 
tomorrow where I have nothing on the schedule, for the first time in 
years and years, to go off----

[At this point, the President's microphone failed.]

    So what, I didn't want to give a speech anyway. Hello. [Laughter]

Note: The President spoke at 12:13 p.m. at Adams Field.
