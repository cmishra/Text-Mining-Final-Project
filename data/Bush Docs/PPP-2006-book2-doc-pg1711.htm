Remarks Following a Meeting With the Republican Senate Conference
September 28, 2006

    I just had a really constructive and interesting session with 
Republican Members of the United States Senate. I'm impressed by the 
leadership here in the Senate. I'm impressed by the caliber of people 
that serve our country.
    I want to congratulate the House for passing a very vital piece of 
legislation that will give us the tools necessary to protect the 
American people, and that's the Hamdan legislation. That's the 
legislation that will give us the capacity to be able to interrogate 
high-valued detainees and, at the same time, give us the capacity to try 
people who--in our military tribunals.
    In speaking to the Senate, I urged them to get this legislation to 
my desk as soon as possible. Senator Frist<Frist, Bill<ls-thn-eq> and 
Senator McConnell<McConnell, Addison M. ``Mitch''<ls-thn-eq> committed 
to that end. The American people need to know we're working together to 
win this war on terror. Our most important responsibility is to protect

the American people from further attack, and we cannot be able to tell 
the American people we're doing our full job unless we have the tools 
necessary to do so. And this legislation passed in the House yesterday 
is a part of making sure that we do have the capacity to protect you.
    Our most solemn job is the security of this country. People 
shouldn't forget there's still an enemy out there that wants to do harm 
to the United States. And therefore, a lot of my discussion with the 
Members of the Senate was to remind them of this solemn responsibility. 
And so I look forward to you passing good legislation, Senators. Thank 
you for having me. Appreciate your time.

Note: The President spoke at 9:16 a.m. at the U.S. Capitol. In his 
remarks, he referred to H.R. 6166.
