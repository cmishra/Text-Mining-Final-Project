Statement on Turkey's European Union Candidacy
December 11, 1999

    It is with great pleasure that I welcome the European Union's offer 
on Friday to Turkey and Turkey's acceptance of EU candidate status. The 
United States has long supported Turkey's bid to join the EU, in the 
belief that this would have lasting benefits not only for Turkey but 
also for all EU members and the United States. On Friday the EU and 
Turkey took a big step toward bringing that goal to fruition.
    I would like to congratulate Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit<Ecevit, 
Bulent> for his government's decision to accept the EU offer. 
Under Mr. Ecevit, Turkey has launched an impressive array of political, 
economic, human rights, and other reforms that

demonstrate conclusively its commitment to take its rightful place in 
Europe.
    I would like to express my admiration to Greek Prime Minister 
Simitis<Simitis, Konstandinos> for his statesmanship and 
groundbreaking efforts with Mr. Ecevit<Ecevit, Bulent> to 
improve relations between Greece and Turkey, efforts which were key to 
bringing about this momentous development.
    Finally, I want to congratulate all the members of the European 
Union for their decision and to express my support for their vision of a 
Europe stronger and more united for its embrace of diversity. In 
particular, Finnish Prime Minister Lipponen<Lipponen, Paavo> 
deserves credit for his hard work and skill in helping to bring about 
this extraordinary achievement.
