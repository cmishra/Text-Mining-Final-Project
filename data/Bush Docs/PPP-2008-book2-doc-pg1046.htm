Message to the Congress Certifying Exports to the People's Republic of 
China
July 22, 2008

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom 
Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public 
Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export of 22 accelerometers for 
incorporation into railway geometry measurement systems and one 20-inch 
fluid energy mill for production of nutritional supplements is not 
detrimental to the United States space launch industry, and that the 
material and equipment, including any indirect technical benefit that 
could be derived from such exports, will not measurably improve the 
missile or space launch capabilities of the People's Republic of China.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 July 22, 2008.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
July 23.
