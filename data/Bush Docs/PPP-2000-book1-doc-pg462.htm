Joint Statement by President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony 
Blair<Blair, Tony<ls-thn-eq> of the United Kingdom on Availability of 
Human Genome Data
March 14, 2000

    In the last decade of the twentieth century, scientists from around 
the world initiated one of the most significant scientific projects of 
all time: to determine the DNA sequence of the entire human genome, the 
human genetic blueprint. Progressing ahead of schedule, human genome 
research is rapidly advancing our understanding of the causes of human 
disease and will serve as the foundation for development of a new 
generation of effective treatments, preventions, and cures.
    To realize the full promise of this research, raw fundamental data 
on the human genome, including the human DNA sequence and its 
variations, should be made freely available to scientists everywhere. 
Unencumbered access to this information will promote discoveries that 
will reduce the burden of disease, improve health around the world, and 
enhance the quality of life for all humankind. Intellectual property 
protection for gene-based inventions will also play an important role in 
stimulating the development of important new health care products.
    We applaud the decision by scientists working on the Human Genome 
Project to release raw fundamental information about the human DNA 
sequence and its variants rapidly into the public domain, and we commend 
other scientists around the world to adopt this policy.
