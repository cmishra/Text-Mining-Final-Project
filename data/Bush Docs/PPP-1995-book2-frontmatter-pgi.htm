                                Foreword

    The period from July through December 1995 was an exceptional time. 
On fundamental issues--the role of Government, our role in the world, 
and how we can build a strong American community--our people came 
together after intense debate to forge new approaches that applied our 
enduring values to the challenges of new times.

    During this period, the American people engaged in a great national 
debate about how best to balance the budget. I proposed and fought for a 
plan to balance the budget in a way that reflected our values, by 
strengthening Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment. The 
congressional majority put forward a plan that I believed did not honor 
our fundamental values; I vetoed that plan. By year's end, after the 
congressional majority twice shut down the Government, it was clear that 
the American people had rallied to our view. We need a smaller 
Government, but one strong enough to give people the tools to make the 
most of their own lives.

    America also decisively reasserted its role as the world's 
indispensable nation. On my remarkable trip to Northern Ireland and 
Ireland--and to Jerusalem, for the funeral of Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin--Americans were once again reminded of our unique 
obligation to lead and to be a force for peace where possible. And in 
Bosnia, America led the way to bring to an end the bloodiest conflict in 
Europe since World War II. By committing our troops to help maintain the 
peace in Bosnia, we recommitted ourselves to being the world's strongest 
force for peace, freedom, and prosperity.

    Perhaps most important, this was a time when we worked to find 
common ground and bridge the intense divisions of race, religion, and 
geography that threaten to pull us apart. In a series of speeches, I 
called on Americans to find common ground. At Georgetown University, I 
urged a new tone of civility based on the common values that bind us 
together. In speeches on affirmative action at the National Archives in 
Washington and in Austin, Texas, I called on all Americans to clean 
their house of the racism that is still too real among us. And I spoke 
about the proper role of religion in our lives and communities, arguing 
that our schools need not be prayer-free zones.

    The closing months of 1995 set the course for how our Nation can 
move confidently toward the 21st century. By holding true to our 
values--opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and building a 
strong American community--our Nation passed through this moment of 
decision stronger than ever before.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period July 1-December 31, 1995. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush are 
also available.
