Statement on the Situation at the Crandall Canyon Mine in Huntington, 
Utah
September 1, 2007

    Since August 6, Americans have followed the fate of six miners 
trapped in a Utah mine. We have prayed for their safety, asked God to 
comfort their families, and witnessed the unwavering commitment of their 
community. Our hearts broke when three brave rescue workers gave their 
own lives in the search for the missing miners.
    The people of the central Utah mining community have inspired us all 
with their incredible strength and courage in the face of tremendous 
loss. Last night a difficult decision was made to end the search. 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by this tragedy 
and continue to pray for the families of these men.
