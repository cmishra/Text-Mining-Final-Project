Statement on the Death of Albert Shanker
February 22, 1997

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened today to learn of the passing of 
Albert Shanker. Al spent his life in pursuit of one of the noblest of 
causes, the improvement of our public schools. Since 1964, he led 
educational organizations, first as the president of the United 
Federation of Teachers in New York and for 22 years as the president of 
the American Federation of Teachers. He challenged the country's 
teachers and schools to provide our children with the very best 
education possible and made a crusade out of the need for educational 
standards. He believed, as I do, that children should not go through 
school without learning the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Eadie, and his family 
tonight.
