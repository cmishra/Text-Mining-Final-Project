Memorandum on the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights
December 9, 1998

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

Subject: The Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights

    This month we mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, the United Nations General Assembly declaration 
affirming a universal standard of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
In so doing, we also honor the legacy of Eleanor Roosevelt, who served 
as the first Chairperson of the United Nations Commission on Human 
Rights and who was the driving force behind the Declaration.
    To reaffirm our commitment to the principles of the Declaration and 
to honor the contributions of Eleanor Roosevelt, I hereby direct you to 
establish the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights. You are 
authorized to take all necessary steps to establish an appropriate 
awards program under the auspices of your Department to recognize 
distinguished Americans who have made especially meritorious 
contributions to the promotion and protection of human rights within the 
United States or around the world.
    These awards will be presented on or about December 10 of each year 
as part of the commemoration of the anniversary of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights. Prior to November 15 of each year, you 
shall present to me a list of nominees from which I will select up to 
five individuals or groups of individuals to receive this award. In 
preparing your list of nominees, you may consider the recommendations of 
appropriate individuals and groups and coordinate your nominations in 
consultation with other Federal agencies as appropriate. You may include 
recommendations for posthumous awards.
    You are directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: This memorandum was not received for publication in the Federal 
Register.
