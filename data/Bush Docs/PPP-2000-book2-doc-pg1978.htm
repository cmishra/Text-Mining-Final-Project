Statement on the Circuit Court Decision on Affirmative Action in Federal 
Transportation Construction Contracting
September 28, 2000

    This week in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater, the tenth circuit 
upheld the constitutionality of a major affirmative action program 
dealing with Federal transportation construction contracting. I am very 
pleased with the court's decision. It strongly affirms what I have 
consistently stated: Federal affirmative action programs are still 
needed to remedy past and present discrimination and can be implemented 
in a constitutional manner. My administration has worked very hard to 
mend, but not end, Federal affirmative action programs, and we are 
gratified that the court has validated our efforts.
