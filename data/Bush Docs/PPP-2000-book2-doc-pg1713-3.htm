Remarks to the Community in Ushafa, Nigeria
August 27, 2000

    Well, thank you very much. Let me say, first of all, I want to thank 
your chief<Baba, Alhaji Mohammadu> for making me feel so 
welcome, and all the elected officials. I want to thank the people who 
danced for us and played for us. They were very good, yes? [Applause] 
And I want to thank all those who made the gifts you gave to me and my 
daughter and our family. And I want to thank the schoolchildren who 
walked down here with me and sang the beautiful songs.
    I came to Nigeria to express the support of the people of the United 
States. We support your democracy. We want to help you build your 
economy, educate your children, and build a better life in all the 
villages of this country.
    Thank you very, very much.
