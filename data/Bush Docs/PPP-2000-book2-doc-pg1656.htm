Remarks at a ``Tribute to the President'' Reception in Los Angeles
August 14, 2000

    First of all, thank you. Let me say on behalf of my family, we're 
honored to have this Oscar. [Laughter]
    I want to thank the Governor<Davis, Gray> and 
Sharon<Davis, Sharon> for welcoming us to California, for the 
wonderful reception that we've had, for the great convention we've had. 
And I want to say to all of you--I don't know if any of you saw my 
``Home Alone'' video that I did. Do you remember that? [Applause] Well, 
in this ``Home Alone'' video, I was talking to myself in the mirror, and 
I had Kevin Spacey's<Spacey, Kevin> Oscar. And he was 
ungracious enough to come take it away from me, just because he won it, 
and I didn't. So now that I have one of my very own, I'll be able to 
lord it over him.
    We have had a wonderful time. I want to thank the delegates who are 
here from every single State. From the places where we started to the 
places where we ended, it's been a great ride. I want to thank you for 
being so good to Hillary<Clinton, Hillary Rodham> tonight. And 
you just remember what I told you. We had a good run tonight because 
we've had a good 8 years. But the best way

to validate all the work we've done is to win again and keep it going.
    God bless you. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:18 p.m. at Paramount Studios. In his 
remarks, he referred to reception host Gov. Gray Davis of California, 
who presented the President with an honorary Oscar statuette for ``Best 
President.'' The President also referred to Governor Davis' wife, 
Sharon.
