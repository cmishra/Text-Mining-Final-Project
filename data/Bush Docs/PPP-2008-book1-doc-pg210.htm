Cotonou, Benin

    Mr. President,<Yayi Boni, Thomas<ls-thn-eq> thank you. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are honored to be with you and the First 
Lady.<Yayi, Chantal de Souza<ls-thn-eq> I gratefully accept this on 
behalf of the American people. I stand here by your side as a friend, a 
believer in your vision, and a partner in your willingness to confront 
the disease and poverty and--that affect mankind.
    We would not be standing here if you and your Government was not 
committed to your people. You mentioned some of the dollar--money we're 
spending with you, but those dollars come with great compassion from the 
American people. We care when we see suffering. We believe we're all 
children of God. And so it's a great honor to accept this award, and the 
American people send their blessings.

Note: The President spoke at 8:28 a.m. at Cadjehoun International 
Airport. In his remarks, he referred to President Thomas Yayi Boni of 
Benin and his wife Chantal de Souza Yayi.
