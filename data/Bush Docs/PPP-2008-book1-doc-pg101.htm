Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
January 22, 2008

    I want to thank the leaders for coming. I initially intended to 
brief the leaders of the House and the Senate on my trip to the Middle 
East, and I intend to do so. But we're going to spend some time talking 
about this economy and the need for us to find common ground for an 
effective progrowth economic package. We had a good call last Thursday, 
and I want to thank the Speaker<Pelosi, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> and the 
leader<Boehner, John A.<ls-thn-eq> and other Members. And Secretary 
Paulson<Paulson, Henry M., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> had a good meeting today.
    I believe we can find common ground to get something done that's big 
enough and effective enough so that an economy that is inherently strong 
gets a boost to make sure that this uncertainty doesn't translate into 
more economic woes for our workers and small-business people.
    And so I really want to thank you all for coming, and I'm looking 
forward to our discussions. And look, there's a--everybody wants to get 
something done quickly, but we want to make sure it gets done right and 
make sure that we're--everybody is realistic about a--the timetable. 
Legislative bodies don't move as--necessarily in an orderly, quick way. 
And therefore, these leaders are committed, and they want to get 
something done. But we want to make sure

we're realistic about how fast that can possibly happen. And so when we 
say, ``as soon as possible,'' that means within the--obviously within 
the ability of these bodies to effectively do their jobs.
    So I have got reasonable expectations about how fast something can 
happen, but I also am optimistic that something will happen. And I 
appreciate very much the leadership being here today. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 2:43 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
