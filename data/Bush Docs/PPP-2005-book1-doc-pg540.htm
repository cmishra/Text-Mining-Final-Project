Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Trade 
Negotiations
March 30, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with section 2103(c)(2) of the Trade Act of 2002, I ask 
that the Congress extend trade promotion authority procedures for 2 
years, and I enclose a report prepared by my Administration on trade 
negotiations conducted under those procedures.
    Trade promotion authority is essential to expanding opportunities 
for American businesses, workers, and farmers. Working with the 
Congress, my Administration has completed trade agreements with 12 
nations on 5 continents that will open a combined market of 124 million 
consumers for America's farmers, manufacturers, and service providers.

    We must continue to pursue bilateral and regional agreements to open 
new markets, and we must complete negotiations in the World Trade 
Organization to reduce global

barriers to trade. We will continue to enforce vigorously the trade laws 
so that American businesses and workers are competing on a level playing 
field.
    Free and fair trade creates jobs, raises living standards, and 
lowers prices for families here at home. Trade agreements also deepen 
our partnerships with countries that want to trade in freedom. I look 
forward to the continued close cooperation with the Congress in pursuing 
these objectives.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
