Statement on the Executive Order on Energy Efficiency and 
Water Conservation at Federal Facilities
March 8, 1994

    For too long, we have paid too much to heat, cool, and light Federal 
buildings. That's why I'm directing all agencies across the Nation to 
make profitable investments in energy efficiency, investments that will 
benefit the environment and the taxpayer. This initiative makes 
Government work better and cost less.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the signing of the Executive order, which is listed in Appendix D at the 
end of this volume.
