Remarks Following a Meeting With Military and Diplomatic Leaders
January 5, 2006

    It's been my honor to host former Secretaries of State and 
Secretaries of Defense from Republican administrations and Democratic 
administrations here at the White House. I've asked Secretary Rice<Rice, 
Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> and Secretary Rumsfeld<Rumsfeld, Donald 
H.<ls-thn-eq> and Ambassador Khalilzad<Khalilzad, Zalmay<ls-thn-eq> and 
General Casey<Casey, George W., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> to bring these men and 
women up to date on our strategy for victory in Iraq.
    I've also had a chance to listen to their concerns, their 
suggestions about the way forward. Not everybody around this table agree 
with my decision to go into Iraq, and I fully understand that. But these 
are good, solid Americans who understand that we've got to succeed now 
that we're there. And I'm most grateful for the suggestions that have 
been given. We take to heart the advice. We appreciate your experience, 
and we appreciate you taking time out of your day.
    We have a dual-track strategy for victory. On the one hand, we will 
work to have a political process that says to all Iraqis, ``The future 
belongs to you.'' And on the other hand, we'll continue to work on the 
security situation there. The main thrust of our success will be when 
the Iraqis are able to take the fight to the enemy that wants to stop 
their democracy, and we're making darn good progress along those lines.
    Again, I want to thank you all for coming. I appreciate your 
interests. I appreciate you being such a solid citizen of our country.

Note: The President spoke at 10:31 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to Gen. George W. Casey, Jr., 
USA, commanding general, Multi-National Force--Iraq. Participating in 
the

meeting were former Secretaries of State Colin L. Powell, Madeleine K. 
Albright, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, James A. Baker III, George P. Shultz, 
and Alexander M. Haig, Jr.; and former Secretaries of Defense William S. 
Cohen, William J. Perry, Frank C. Carlucci, Harold Brown, James R. 
Schlesinger, Melvin R. Laird, and Robert S. McNamara.
