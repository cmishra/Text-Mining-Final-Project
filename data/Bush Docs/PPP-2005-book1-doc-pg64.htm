Remarks at ``America's Future Rocks Today--A Call to Service''
January 18, 2005

    Thank you all. I hope you've enjoyed this fantastic concert. I'm 
traveling--as you can see, I'm traveling in pretty good company today, 
with the First Lady of the United States, Laura,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
the mother of Barbara<Bush, Barbara P.<ls-thn-eq> and Jenna<Bush, 
Jenna<ls-thn-eq> who we love dearly.

    Listen, I want to thank all the entertainers who were here today. 
How about Hilary Duff.<Duff, Hilary<ls-thn-eq> She was fantastic. Thank 
you, Hilary. JoJo--JoJo<Levesque, Joanna N. ``JoJo''<ls-thn-eq> is 
here--[applause]--yes. Ruben<Studdard, Ruben<ls-thn-eq> Studdard--you 
talk about a success story. Ryan Cabrera--I appreciate Ryan<Cabrera, 
Ryan<ls-thn-eq> being here. How about 3 Doors Down? Pretty cool guys, 
right? Seem cool to me. Fuel--I appreciate Fuel being here.

    Jason<Sehorn, Jason<ls-thn-eq> Sehorn--I'm honored that my friend 
Jason--and I'm really proud and pleased that he brought his wife, Angie 
Harmon.<Harmon, Angie<ls-thn-eq> I want to thank Steve Baldwin<Baldwin, 
Stephen<ls-thn-eq> for being with us today. I'm honored that Steve was 
here. Erika Harold,<Harold, Erika<ls-thn-eq> Miss America 2003--what a 
fine person Erika is. How about Kelly Perdew,<Perdew, Kelly<ls-thn-eq> 
``The Apprentice.'' Next thing you know, the guy will be running for 
President. Nancy<O'Dell, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> O'Dell--I'm honored that Nancy 
is with us. I appreciate you all coming.
    Listen, I'm particularly thrilled to be standing on the stage with 
some of America's soldiers in the army of compassion. So the theme of 
this Inauguration is to celebrate freedom and to honor service. Today 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I went by and we were able to thank 
some of the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform for their 
service to our country, for their sacrifice for our freedoms. And today, 
at this concert, we're particularly thrilled that we're honoring 
service.
    You know what that means? It means love a neighbor just like you'd 
like to be loved yourself. Take time out of your life to make somebody 
else's life better. By helping heal a broken heart or surrounding a 
friend with love or feeding the hungry or providing shelter for the 
homeless, you can help change America for the better, one heart, one 
soul, one conscience at a time.
    I want to thank you all for setting such a fantastic example. Thank 
you for your service.
    And my call to you all is that as you enjoy the great freedoms of 
America and as you enjoy yourself at this Inauguration,

I hope you take away the lesson of helping somebody in need. And when 
you do, it will not only make our country a better place; it will lift 
up your own spirit.
    Thanks for coming. Enjoy yourself. May God bless you all, and may 
God bless America.

Note: The President spoke at 6:54 p.m. at the District of Columbia 
National Guard Armory. In his remarks, he referred to professional 
football player Jason Sehorn and his wife, actress Angie Harmon; actor 
Stephen Baldwin; and television personality Nancy O'Dell.
