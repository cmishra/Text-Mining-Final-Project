Remarks Following a Meeting With Economic Advisers on the National 
Economy
March 17, 2008

    Mr. Secretary,<Paulson, Henry M., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much 
for coming by today to talk about the economic situation. We'll be 
meeting later on this afternoon with the President's task force on 
financial markets.
    First of all, you know, the Secretary<Paulson, Henry M., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> has given me an update. One thing is for certain: We're 
under--we're in challenging times. But another thing is for certain, 
that we've taken strong and decisive action. The Federal Reserve has 
moved quickly to bring order to the financial markets. Secretary Paulson 
has been--is supportive of that action, as am I. And I want to thank 
you, Mr. Secretary, for working over the weekend. You've shown the 
country and the world that the United States is on top of the situation.
    Secondly, you've reaffirmed the fact that our financial institutions 
are strong and that our capital markets are functioning efficiently and 
effectively. We obviously will continue to monitor the situation and, 
when need be, will act decisively, in a way that continues to bring 
order to the financial markets.
    In the long run, our economy is going to be fine. Right now we're 
dealing with a difficult situation. And, Mr. Secretary,<Paulson, Henry 
M., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> I want to thank you very much for your steady and 
strong and consistent leadership.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 9:40 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House.
