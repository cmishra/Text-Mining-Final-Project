Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Fiscal Year 2006 Budget 
Legislation
March 17, 2005

    I applaud the House for passing a budget that protects America, 
promotes economic growth, supports our priorities, and keeps us on track 
to cut the deficit in half by 2009. It closely follows my budget 
proposal and reflects our shared commitment to be wise with the people's 
money and restrain spending in Washington, DC.
