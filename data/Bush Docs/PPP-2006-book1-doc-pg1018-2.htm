Statement on Signing the Coastal Barrier Resources Reauthorization Act 
of 2005
May 25, 2006

    Today I have signed into law S. 1869, the ``Coastal Barrier 
Resources Reauthorization Act of 2005.'' This Act provides for digital 
mapping in support of the coastal barrier resources system and 
authorizes appropriations through fiscal year 2010 for implementation of 
the Coastal Barrier Resources Act.
    Section 3(c)(2) and section 4(c)(3)(C) and (D) purport to require 
executive branch officials to submit legislative recommendations to the 
Congress. The executive branch shall construe such provisions in a 
manner consistent with the Constitution's commitment to the President of 
the authority to submit for the consideration of the Congress such 
measures as the President judges necessary and expedient and to 
supervise the unitary executive branch.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 May 25, 2006.
