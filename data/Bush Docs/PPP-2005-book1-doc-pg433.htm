Statement on the Nomination of Karen Hughes<Hughes, Karen P.<ls-thn-eq> 
To Be Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy
March 14, 2005

    Our long-term strategy to keep the peace is to help change the 
conditions that give rise to extremism and terror by spreading the 
universal principle of human liberty. This will require an aggressive 
effort to share and communicate America's fundamental values while 
respecting the cultures and traditions of other nations.
    Karen Hughes has been one of my most trusted and closest advisers, 
and she has the experience, expertise, and judgment to lead this 
critical effort. Her return to public service in this important position 
signifies my personal commitment to the international diplomacy that is 
needed in these historic times. I value her counsel and friendship, as 
does Secretary Rice.<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq>
