Statement on the Death of Archbishop of Athens and All Greece 
Christodoulos<Archbishop Christodoulos<ls-thn-eq>
January 28, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I offer our condolences to the 
people of Greece at this time of mourning for the death of the 
Archbishop of Athens and All Greece Christodoulos. The late Archbishop 
was well known as an articulate voice of the Orthodox faith, for his 
engagement in interreligious dialogue, and for his promotion of social 
programs to help the vulnerable. Our prayers are with the people of 
Greece and all those who followed his spiritual guidance.
