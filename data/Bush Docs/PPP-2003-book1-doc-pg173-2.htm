 Statement on Congressional Action on 2003 Appropriations Legislation
 February 13, 2003

     I commend the Congress for finishing work on the 2003 
appropriations bills. This budget will provide valuable resources for 
priorities such as homeland security, military operations, and 
education, while adhering to the spending restraint set forth in my 
budget. I look forward to signing this legislation and to continuing a 
course of fiscal discipline.
