Statement on Signing the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993
August 13, 1993

    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 631, the ``Colorado Wilderness 
Act of 1993.'' This Act designates 19 areas within the National Forests 
and public lands of Colorado, encompassing 612,000 acres, as components 
of the National Wilderness Preservation System. This Act also

protects five areas, totalling some 155,000 acres, under management 
plans that are slightly less restrictive than wilderness designation.
    Enactment of this bill ends a long debate regarding wilderness 
designation in the National Forests of Colorado. Key to resolving this 
debate is the compromise language on the protection of wilderness water 
resources. Because all of the areas designated as wilderness lie at the 
headwaters of river watersheds, wilderness water resources can be 
protected by restricting new diversions of water from within these 
areas. Existing water rights and water diversions are also protected by 
this Act. In short, the Colorado delegation has found an innovative 
solution to a very complicated water resources issue, and for this they 
are to be commended. However, the circumstances in Colorado are unique 
and this compromise language may have to be refined if it is to be used 
to protect wilderness water resources in other States.
    By signing this bill into law today, we further the protection of 
unique and sensitive lands within the National Forests of Colorado. The 
areas designated in this Act are outstanding additions to the National 
Wilderness Preservation System. These areas join the 2.6 million acres 
of outstanding National Forest System (NFS) lands in the State that have 
already been designated as wilderness. At the same time, this Act 
releases about 115,000 acres of NFS lands in Colorado for other 
purposes, balancing the goal of environmental protection with the need 
to provide for a healthy economy.
    Today, we complete the decade-long process of reviewing wilderness 
study areas in Colorado that were designated in earlier legislation. I 
commend the Colorado delegation for their diligence and bipartisan 
leadership in making this Act a reality. This balanced approach to 
wilderness designation preserves opportunities for economic development 
in Colorado, while maintaining the quality of life that makes Colorado 
such a wonderful place to live and work.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
August 13, 1993.

Note: H.R. 631, approved August 13, was assigned Public Law No. 103-77. 
This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
August 14.
