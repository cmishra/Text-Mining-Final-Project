Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Implementation 
of the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption
May 2, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    Pursuant to the resolution of advice and consent to ratification of 
the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption adopted by the Senate 
on July 27, 2000, the President must submit to the Speaker of the House 
of Representatives and the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations an annual implementation report each year for a 5-year period. 
Attached is the first such report.
    As this report illustrates, countries throughout our hemisphere have 
taken important steps through legislative and executive actions to 
implement the Convention. These actions are indications of the 
realization that corruption threatens political and economic stability 
and undermines democracy. This report also outlines the steps taken to 
establish an evaluation mechanism--known as the Committee of Experts--to 
oversee implementation of the Convention.
    I look forward to working with the Congress to ensure that we 
continue to combat corruption in our hemisphere and across the globe.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Committee on 
Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on May 3.
