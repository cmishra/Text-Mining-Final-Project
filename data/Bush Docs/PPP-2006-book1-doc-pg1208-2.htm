Statement on the Resignation of Norman Y. Mineta<Mineta, Norman 
Y.<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of Transportation
June 23, 2006

    Norman Mineta has served America with integrity, dedication, and 
distinction. He leaves his position as the longest serving Secretary of 
Transportation in our Nation's history.
    Norm's life is a story of determination, courage, and service. As a 
child, he lived in an internment camp. As a young man, he wore his 
country's uniform in Korea and Japan. From there, he went on to become a 
mayor, a Congressman, and a Cabinet Secretary under two Presidents.
    As my Secretary of Transportation, Norm performed a crucial role on 
September 11, 2001, leading the successful effort to bring tens of 
thousands of passengers aboard commercial aircraft to safe landings. His 
leadership was vital to strengthening the security of America's seaports 
and airports. Norm worked hard to help eliminate red tape and liberalize 
the commercial aviation

market. After Hurricane Katrina, Norm and his team were able to rapidly 
repair and reopen the region's major highways, airports, seaports, and 
pipelines. He also oversaw important changes in fuel economy standards 
that will save fuel, save lives, and save jobs.
    Norm is an inspiration to all of us and has earned the admiration of 
a grateful Nation. I am honored that he agreed to serve in my Cabinet. 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish Norm, Deni,<Mineta,
