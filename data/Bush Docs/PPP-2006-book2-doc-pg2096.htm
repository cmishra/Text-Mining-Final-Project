Remarks Following Discussions With President Nguyen Minh Triet<Triet, 
Nguyen Minh<ls-thn-eq> of Vietnam in Hanoi
November 17, 2006

    Mr. President, thank you very much for your hospitality. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I have been struck by the friendliness of the 
people of Vietnam. In our drive through this beautiful city, we were 
pleased to see thousands of your citizens with smiles on their faces. 
And we're so grateful.
    I've been reading and studying about your country, and I have seen 
now firsthand the great vibrancy and the excitement that's taking place 
in Vietnam. You're like a young tiger, and I look forward to continuing 
to work to make sure our bilateral relations are close. And thank you 
for hosting APEC. And thank you for hosting a dinner for us tonight. 
We're really looking forward to it.

Note: The President spoke at 2:35 p.m. at the Presidential Palace. A 
portion of these remarks could not be verified because the tape was 
incomplete.
