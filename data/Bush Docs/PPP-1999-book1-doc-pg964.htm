Statement on House Action on Gun Control Legislation
June 18, 1999

    Instead of closing the deadly gun show loophole, the House of 
Representatives voted in the dark of night to let criminals keep buying 
guns at gun shows. This vote will not stand the light of day. I will 
keep working until the Congress stands up to the gun lobby and makes the 
commonsense measures passed by the Senate the law of the land. We owe it 
to the families of the children who died in Littleton to give all 
Americans the safety they deserve.
