Statement on the Death of Martin Slate
February 24, 1997

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Marty 
Slate. Marty has been a dear friend since our years at Yale Law School 
and was the quintessential public servant.
    From his days as a Freedom Rider in Mississippi to his years as a 
senior civil servant at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and 
the Internal Revenue Service, Marty spent his entire life working to 
make sure our laws were fair and applied justly.
    Four years ago, I was delighted when Marty answered my call to 
return to public service. As Executive Director of the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation, he brought a new standard of excellence to that 
agency. He improved the PBGC's level of customer service and its 
financial management, winning an Innovation in American Government Award 
from the John F. Kennedy School and several Vice Presidential Hammer 
Awards for Excellence in Government.

Marty fought successfully for important new legislation that brought 
renewed financial stability to the Corporation, expanded pension 
coverage, and ensured that millions of Americans' pensions were more 
secure.
    Hillary and I will miss him greatly. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with Cookie and his family on this sad day.
