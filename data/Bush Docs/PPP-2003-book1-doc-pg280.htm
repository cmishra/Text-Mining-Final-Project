Letter to Congressional Leaders on the Conclusion of Diplomatic Efforts 
With Regard to Iraq
March 18, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with section 3(b) of the Authorization for Use of 
Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243), and 
based on information available to me, including that in the enclosed 
document, I determine that:
       (1)   reliance by the United States on further diplomatic and 
            other peaceful means alone will neither (A) adequately 
            protect the national security of the United States against 
            the continuing threat posed by Iraq nor (B) likely lead to 
            enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Council 
            resolutions regarding Iraq; and
       (2)   acting pursuant to the Constitution and Public Law 107-243 
            is consistent with the United States and other countries 
            continuing to take the necessary actions against 
            international terrorists and terrorist organizations, 
            including those nations, organizations, or persons who 
            planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist 
            attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Ted Stevens, President pro tempore of the 
Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
March 19.
