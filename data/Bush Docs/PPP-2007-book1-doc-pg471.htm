Statement on the Death of Boris Yeltsin<Yeltsin, Boris<ls-thn-eq>
April 23, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin. President Yeltsin was an 
historic figure who served his country during a time of momentous 
change. He played a key role as the Soviet Union dissolved, helped lay 
the foundations of freedom in Russia, and became the first 
democratically elected leader in that country's history. I appreciate 
the efforts that President Yeltsin made to build a strong relationship 
between Russia and the United States. We offer our sincerest condolences 
to the Yeltsin family and to the Russian people.
