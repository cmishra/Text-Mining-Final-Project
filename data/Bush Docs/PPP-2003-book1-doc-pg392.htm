Statement on the Death of Edward Gaylord<Gaylord, Edward> 
April 28, 2003

    Edward Gaylord was a shining example of generosity, patriotism, and 
dedication to helping others. As a business leader with a distinguished 
career in journalism, he spent a lifetime in selfless service to his 
community and State. I was honored to have Ed as a partner in the Texas 
Rangers Baseball Club. He was an excellent partner and a fine man. 
Laura<Bush, Laura> joins me in extending our heartfelt 
condolences to Ed's family and friends.
