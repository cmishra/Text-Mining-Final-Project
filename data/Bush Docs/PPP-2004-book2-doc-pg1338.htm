Exchange With Reporters in Oshkosh, Wisconsin
July 14, 2004

President's Visit to Wisconsin

    Q. Mr. President, your reaction to the crowds and the towns?
    The President. Very, very warm and very hospitable reaction. A lot 
of people coming out, for which I'm grateful.
    Q. What did you get?
    The President. Vanilla custard. It's highly recommended. I'm 
recommending vanilla for Hillman [G. Robert Hillman, Dallas Morning 
News].
    Q. You are dripping. You need a napkin.
    The President. I'm going to get one in a minute. Would you like 
some?
    Q. No, thanks.
    The President. I'm trying to get you a little national publicity.
    Q. I think I've got all I need. [Laughter]
    The President. I enjoyed talking to you, girls. Enjoyed talking to 
you. Thank you.
    All right, let's go back to work.
    Q. First a candy store and now ice cream, sir?
    The President. I'm loading up, carbo-loading for the weekend. 
[Laughter]
