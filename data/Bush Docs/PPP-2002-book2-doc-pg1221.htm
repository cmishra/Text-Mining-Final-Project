Year 2003 Budget Request
July 11, 2002

To the Congress of the United States:
    Pursuant to my constitutional authority and consistent with sections 
202(c) and (e) of The District of Columbia Financial Management and 
Responsibility Assistance Act of 1995 and section 446 of The District of 
Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am 
transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Request 
Act.
    The proposed FY 2003 Budget Request Act reflects the major 
programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of 
Columbia. For FY 2003, the District estimates total revenues and 
expenditures of $5.7 billion.
