Message on the Observance of Eid al-Fitr
October 1, 2007

    I send greetings to Muslims in the United States and around the 
world celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the Festival of Breaking the Fast.
    The great faith of Islam has enhanced our society and brought 
comfort and strength to generations in America and around the world. The 
three day festival of Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the month-long fast 
of Ramadan and is a time to look forward with a spirit of renewal and 
hope, and celebrate the rich Islamic tradition of charity and giving. 
During this holiday, Muslims gather with family and friends to share in 
traditional food, thank God for His blessings, and reach out to the less 
fortunate.
    Our Nation is proud to be a land of many beliefs, and our society is 
enriched by our Muslim citizens. On the first day of Shawwal, the tenth 
month of the Islamic calendar, may people of all faiths reflect on the 
values we hold in common, including love of family, the importance of 
community, and gratitude to God.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a joyful 
celebration. Eid Mubarak.

                                                          George W. Bush
