Statement on Senate Action on Work Incentives Legislation
June 16, 1999

    Nearly a year ago, I committed to working with Senators 
Jeffords<Jeffords, James M.> and Kennedy<Kennedy, Edward 
M.> to pass the ``Work Incentives Improvement Act.'' In 
January, in my State of the Union Address, I urged the Congress make 
this historic, bipartisan legislation a top priority and fully funded it 
in the budget I sent to Congress. And on June 4th I challenged the 
Congress to send the work incentives bill to me by July 26th, so I could 
sign this legislation into law on the ninth anniversary of the enactment 
of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
    Today, in an overwhelming 99 to 0 vote, the Senate passed the work 
incentives bill. This impressive vote sends a strong signal that all 
Americans, including people with disabilities, should have the 
opportunity to work. Americans with disabilities can and do bring 
tremendous energy and talent to the American work force, but the 
unemployment rate for all working-age adults with disabilities is nearly 
75 percent. One of the most glaring problems is that people with 
disabilities frequently become ineligible for Medicaid or Medicare if 
they go back to work. This puts people with disabilities in the 
untenable position of choosing between health care coverage and work. 
The ``Work Incentives Improvement Act'' would improve job opportunities 
for people with disabilities by increasing access to health care and 
employment services.
    Senators Jeffords,<Jeffords, James M.> Kennedy,<Kennedy, 
Edward M.> Roth,<Roth, William V., Jr.> and 
Moynihan<Moynihan, Daniel Patrick> deserve special recognition 
for their leadership on this historic legislation. I urge the House to 
follow their lead. Under the leadership of Congressmen Bliley,<Bliley, 
Tom> Dingell,<Dingell, John D.> Waxman,<Waxman, 
Henry A.> and Lazio,<Lazio, Rick> I am confident 
that it will. I also hope and expect the Senate and House to find 
offsets for this bill that are acceptable to all parties. This bill will 
provide critical work opportunities to people with disabilities, and I 
look forward to signing this groundbreaking legislation.
