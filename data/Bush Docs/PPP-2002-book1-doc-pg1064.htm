Statement on Signing Legislation To Implement International Conventions 
Against Terrorism
June 25, 2002

    Earlier today I signed into law the implementing legislation for two 
very important United Nations international conventions against 
terrorism: the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist 
Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism. I thank the Congress, especially the judiciary 
committees, for its hard work in passing this legislation, which will 
strengthen our campaign against global terrorism. The Senate gave its 
advice and consent to ratification of these Conventions last December. 
Now that this legislation has been enacted, the United States will 
deposit its instruments of ratification at the United Nations and become 
a party to these two Conventions.
    These two Conventions strengthen international efforts to defeat 
terrorism of global reach. They underscore--along with 10 other 
international terrorism conventions--the broad moral consensus that 
violence against innocent civilians is a criminal act and must be 
punished. These Conventions also require parties to them to take 
practical steps to bring terrorists and their supporters to justice. The 
Terrorist Bombings Convention creates a new and important mechanism for 
nations to cooperate in investigating and prosecuting terrorist crimes. 
The International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of 
Terrorism strengthens our continuing efforts to cut off the flow of 
funds to terrorist groups.

    In Canada this week, I will be discussing with leaders from other 
industrialized nations ways we can ensure that all countries take 
stronger legal measures against terrorism. In particular, I urge all 
countries to join us in becoming party to these Conventions and fully 
adhering to U.N. Security Council Resolutions to stop terrorism, 
particularly U.N. Security Council Resolution 1373, which denies safe 
haven to terrorists and prohibits terrorist financing, recruitment, and 
access to weapons and other support. I will continue to work with other 
leaders around the world to build a consensus that terrorism, whatever 
the excuse, is unacceptable. Working together, America and the other 
freedom-loving nations of the world are moving towards a day when our 
children can live free from the fear of terrorism and free to achieve 
their dreams.

Note: H.R. 3275, approved June 25, was assigned Public Law No. 107-197.
