December 19, 2003

    Today, I have signed into law S. 1680, the ``Defense Production 
Reauthorization Act of 2003''. The Act extends production-related 
authorities available to the President to provide support for the Armed 
Forces and meet important civil needs.
    Section 123(c) of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992, as 
enacted by

[[Page 1755]]

section 7(c) of the Act, purports to require the executive branch to 
undertake consultations with foreign nations on specific matters and to 
report thereon to the Congress. The executive branch shall construe 
section 123(c) in a manner consistent with the constitutional 
authorities of the President to conduct the Nation's foreign relations 
and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign 
relations, the national security, the deliberative processes of the 
Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 December 19, 2003.

Note: S. 1680, approved December 19, was assigned Public Law No. 108-
195.
