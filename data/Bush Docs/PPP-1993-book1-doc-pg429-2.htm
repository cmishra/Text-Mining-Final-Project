Nomination for an Assistant Secretary of Defense
April 13, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Ashton 
Carter, the director of Harvard's Center for Science and International 
Affairs, to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Security and 
Counter-Proliferation.
    ``One of the key national security challenges of the post-cold-war 
era is containing the spread of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass 
destruction,'' said the President. ``In Ashton Carter we will have an 
experienced and expert Assistant Secretary focusing on the problems and 
seeking solutions.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
