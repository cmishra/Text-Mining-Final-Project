Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process
June 3, 1997

    Today in Belfast, Senator George Mitchell reconvened the talks on 
the future of Northern Ireland that began almost a year ago. I call on 
the political leaders to seize this precious opportunity and begin the 
hard but worthwhile work of negotiating a just and lasting settlement. 
To engage in serious negotiations, to be willing to make principled 
compromises, requires courage and creativity. Now is the time for the 
representatives of the people to show the good sense and good will that 
I saw in such abundance when I visited Northern Ireland. The United 
States will continue to stand with them as they take on, with the two 
Governments, the demanding task of shaping a peaceful and prosperous 
future in which all the people of Northern Ireland will have an equal 
stake.
    As I have said so many times, ideally all the elected parties should 
be at the table when the decisions that shape the future are made. If 
the IRA declares and implements an unequivocal cease-fire, I am 
confident that Sinn Fein will be invited to add its voice to the other 
parties' at the table as they forge a new future for themselves and 
their children.
