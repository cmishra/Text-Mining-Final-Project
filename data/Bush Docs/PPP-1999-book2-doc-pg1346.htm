Statement on the United States Military Aircraft Tragedy in Colombia
July 29, 1999

    I am deeply saddened by the loss of five U.S. Army personnel in 
southern Colombia, who perished in the crash of a U.S. military aircraft 
providing reconnaissance support for combined U.S.-Colombian counterdrug 
operations against illicit traffickers. Also lost in this tragedy were 
two Colombian military personnel.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with our service members' families and 
friends as they cope with this tragic loss. These dedicated Americans 
and their Colombian comrades were engaged in the vital work of combating 
the drug trade, which threatens the welfare and security of both our 
nations.
    We honor their commitment and remember their sacrifice as we 
intensify our efforts here in this country and around the world to 
counter the global drug problem.
