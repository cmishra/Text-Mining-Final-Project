Statement on the Death of Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho<Rahho, Paulos 
Faraj<ls-thn-eq> of Mosul in Iraq
March 13, 2008

    I send my condolences to the Chaldean community and the people of 
Iraq on the death of Archbishop Rahho. I deplore the despicable act of 
violence committed against the Archbishop of Mosul. The terrorists will 
continue to lose in Iraq because they are savage and cruel. Their utter 
disregard for human life, demonstrated by this murder and by recent 
suicide attacks against innocent Iraqis in Baghdad and innocent pilgrims 
celebrating a religious holiday, is turning the Iraqi people against 
them. We will continue to work with the Iraqi Government to protect and 
support civilians, irrespective of religious affiliation.
