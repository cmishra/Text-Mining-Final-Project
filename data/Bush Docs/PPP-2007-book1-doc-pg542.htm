Remarks on Tornado Damage in Greensburg, Kansas
May 6, 2007

    Our hearts are heavy for the loss of life in Greensburg, Kansas. A 
tornado devastated that community. It just basically wiped it out.
    I spoke to the Governor<Sebelius, Kathleen<ls-thn-eq> and Senator 
Pat Roberts<Roberts, Pat<ls-thn-eq> about the extent of the devastation. 
They said to me: ``It's hard to describe how bad this community was 
hit.''
    I have declared a major disaster for that community, and I hope that 
helps. It's going to take a long time for the community to recover. And 
so we'll help in any way we can. There's a certain spirit in the Midwest 
of our country, a pioneer spirit that still exists, and I'm confident 
this community will be rebuilt. To the extent that we can help, we will. 
The most important thing now, though, is for our citizens to ask for the 
good Lord to comfort those who hurt.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 8:26 a.m. at St. John's Episcopal Church in 
Washington, DC. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of 
Kansas.
