Statement on the Death of Catholicos Karekin I<Catholicos Karekin 
I>
July 2, 1999

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of His Holiness 
Karekin I, Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church. I have sent my 
condolences to the Vicar General at the Holy See of Echmiadzin.
    His Holiness was widely respected for his deep scholarship, his deep 
sense of principle, and his sincere devotion to the broadest possible 
ecumenical dialog. To all who followed his inspired leadership in 
Armenia, the United States, and around the world, I offer heartfelt 
sympathy and condolences on behalf of myself and the American people. 
All the members of the Armenian Apostolic Church are in our thoughts and 
our prayers.
