Statement on Northern Ireland
October 14, 2002

    I support the difficult but necessary decision today by British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair<Blair, Tony<ls-thn-eq> to suspend the Northern 
Ireland Executive and Assembly. I welcome the commitment of Prime 
Minister Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern<Ahern, 
Bertie<ls-thn-eq> to restore confidence between the parties and peoples 
of Northern Ireland, hold elections, and reinstate powersharing as soon 
as is possible.

    I join their condemnation of sectarianism and violence and echo 
their call for all parties to make unequivocal their commitment to 
exclusively peaceful and democratic means for pursuing their interests. 
There is simply no place for paramilitaries in a democratic society. I 
also applaud the two Governments' recognition of the central importance 
of policing and the need for continued policing reform.
    I welcome the continued close cooperation of the British and Irish 
Governments as they work toward the full implementation of the Good 
Friday agreement. The United States stands ready to assist their 
efforts. I appeal to everyone in Northern Ireland to recognize the great 
benefits that the agreement has already secured. The Good Friday 
agreement remains the best framework for a lasting peace in Northern 
Ireland.
