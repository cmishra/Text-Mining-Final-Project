Nomination For Deputy Director of the United States Information Agency
May 4, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Penn Kemble, 
Board for International Broadcasting member and a longtime advocate of 
democracy abroad, as Deputy Director of the United States Information 
Agency. Mr. Kemble will serve as Deputy to Joseph Duffey, recently named 
by the President as Director of USIA.
    ``Throughout his career, Penn Kemble has worked hard to promote the 
cause of freedom abroad,'' the President said. ``I am certain he and Joe 
Duffey will work well together to use all of USIA's resources to 
continue pursuing that ideal.''
