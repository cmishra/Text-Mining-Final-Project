Message on the Observance of Yom Kippur, 5764
October 5, 2003

    In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths.

                                                            Proverbs 3:6

    Yom Kippur is a time for people of the Jewish faith to draw near to 
God and seek His forgiveness through repentance and prayer. For Jews in 
the United States and around the world, this day marks the end of the 
High Holy Days and the sealing of God's judgment in the books of life. 
May you find hope and comfort in remembering the lessons of Jonah, the 
power of prayer, and the mercy of the Almighty.
    Faith plays an important role in the lives of many Americans, 
offering strength and guidance for the challenges of each new day. As 
you renew your commitment to your faith and family on this holy day, may 
your actions reflect a compassionate spirit, and may you be inscribed 
and sealed for a good year and long life.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a blessed Yom Kippur.

                                                          George W. Bush
