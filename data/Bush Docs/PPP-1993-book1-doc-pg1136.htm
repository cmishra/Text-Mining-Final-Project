Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Most-Favored-Nation 
Trade Status for Bulgaria
July 20, 1993

To the Congress of the United States:
    On June 3, 1993, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Bulgaria is in full compliance with emigration criteria of the Jackson-
Vanik amendment to, and Section 409 of, the Trade Act of 1974. This 
determination allowed for the continuation of most favored nation (MFN) 
status for Bulgaria without the requirement of an annual waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated formal Report to 
Congress concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of 
Bulgaria. You will find that the report indicates continued Bulgarian 
compliance with U.S. and international standards in the areas of 
emigration and human rights policy.
    The Administration intends to propose legislation, which would let 
me terminate the application of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 to 
Bulgaria.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
July 20, 1993.
