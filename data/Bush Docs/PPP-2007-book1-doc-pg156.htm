Remarks Following a Meeting With United States Ambassador-Designate to 
Iraq Ryan C. Crocker<Crocker, Ryan C.<ls-thn-eq>
February 16, 2007

    The President. I just had a lengthy conversation with our nominee to 
be the Ambassador from the United States to Iraq. I've gotten to know 
Ambassador Ryan

[[Page 157]]

Crocker during my time as President because he's been--fulfilled a very 
important mission for the United States, and that is the Ambassador to 
Pakistan, where he served ably and served well. And I'm confident I 
picked the right man to be our new Ambassador in Iraq.
    The Ambassador will follow General David Petraeus<Petraeus, David 
H.<ls-thn-eq> into Iraq. So now we've got a new military commander and a 
new head of our diplomatic mission there. These are two competent 
individuals who will help us implement our new strategy in the country 
of Iraq. And that new strategy has said that we're going to help this 
young Iraqi Government be able to sustain itself and defend itself by 
enforcing security in the capital city.
    I was telling the Ambassador that I had a visit today with Prime 
Minister Maliki<Maliki, Nuri al-<ls-thn-eq> via secure SVTS. I was 
pleased that he's meeting benchmarks that he had set out for his 
Government. One of the benchmarks was to move Iraqi troops into the city 
of Baghdad--troops that will be complemented by our own troops. He is 
meeting those obligations. A second such benchmark is that he would 
change the rules of engagement so that criminals, regardless of their 
religion, would be brought to justice in equal fashion. He is meeting 
that benchmark. Thirdly, he passed a budget, of which $10 billion is 
available for reconstruction. He said he would do that; the budget has 
been passed; he has met that benchmark. And that's good news for the 
Iraqi people, and it should give people here in the United States 
confidence that this Government knows its responsibilities and is 
following through on those responsibilities.
    And so the Ambassador heads into a really important assignment, 
carrying a message of hope to the Iraqi people that the United States 
wants them to succeed, and a message of urgency to the Iraqi Government 
that our patience is not unlimited and that we expect that Government to 
perform. And as I said, I was able to tell the Prime Minister<Maliki, 
Nuri al-<ls-thn-eq> how much, how closely we're watching, that we've got 
a good, new man coming as Ambassador, and that we appreciate the fact 
that he's beginning to meet the benchmarks that he set out for his 
people.
    Mr. Ambassador, Godspeed, and thank you.
    Ambassador-designate Crocker. Thank you, sir. Pleased to have your 
confidence.
    The President. Thank you.
    By the way, we're looking forward to quick Senate confirmation. He's 
had his hearing. And of course, when I call him ``Ambassador,'' it's not 
Ambassador to Iraq--it's Ambassador-designee to Iraq--but Ambassador now 
in Pakistan. And the Senate needs to confirm him as quickly as possible 
so he can join General Petraeus<Petraeus, David H.<ls-thn-eq> and do the 
job.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 1:43 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Gen. David H. Petraeus, USA, 
commanding general, Multi-National Force--Iraq; and Prime Minister Nuri 
al-Maliki of Iraq.
