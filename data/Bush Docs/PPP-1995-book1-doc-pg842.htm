Message to the Senate Transmitting the Switzerland-United States 
Extradition Treaty
June 9, 1995

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Swiss Confederation, signed at Washington on November 14, 1990. Also 
transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report of the 
Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
    The Treaty is designed to update and standardize the conditions and 
procedures for extradition between the United States and Switzerland. 
Most significantly, it substitutes a dual-criminality clause for a 
current list of extraditable offenses, so that the new Treaty will cover 
numerous offenses not now covered by our extradition treaty with 
Switzerland, including certain narcotics offenses, important forms of 
white collar crime, and parental child abduction. The Treaty also 
provides a legal basis for temporarily surrendering prisoners to stand 
trial for crimes against the laws of the Requesting State.
    The Treaty further represents an important step in combatting 
terrorism by excluding from the scope of the political offense exception 
offenses typically committed by terrorists for which both the United 
States and Switzerland have an obligation under a multilateral 
international agreement to extradite or submit to their authorities for 
the purpose of prosecution. These offenses include aircraft hijacking, 
aircraft sabotage, crimes against internationally protected persons 
(including diplomats), and hostage-taking.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. Upon 
entry into force, it will supersede the Extradition Treaty of May 14, 
1900, and the Supplementary Extradition Treaties of January 10, 1935, 
and January 31, 1940, Between the United States of America and the Swiss 
Confederation.
    This Treaty will make a significant contribution to international 
cooperation in law enforcement. I recommend that the Senate give early 
and favorable consideration to the Treaty and give its advice and 
consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

June 9, 1995.
