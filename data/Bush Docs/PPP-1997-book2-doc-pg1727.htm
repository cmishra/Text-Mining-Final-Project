Certain Former Eastern Bloc States

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies 
of Albania, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and 
Uzbekistan as required by subsections 402(b) and 409(b) of title IV of 
the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''). I have determined that 
Albania, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and 
Uzbekistan are in full compliance with subsections 402(a) and 409(a) of 
the Act. As required by title IV, I will provide the Congress with 
periodic reports regarding the compliance of Albania, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan with these 
emigration standards.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton
