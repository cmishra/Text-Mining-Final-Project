Statement on House of Representatives Action on Earkmark Reform
September 14, 2006

    I applaud the House of Representatives for voting again this week in 
support of greater transparency and accountability in Government. H.R. 
1000 [H. Res. 1000]* would shine a brighter light on earmarks by 
requiring disclosure of the sponsors of each provision. This reform 
would help improve the legislative process by making sure both lawmakers 
and the public are better informed before Congress votes to spend the 
taxpayers' money.
