Statement on Campaign Finance Reform Legislation
February 12, 1997

    In my State of the Union Address, I said that delay would mean the 
death of campaign finance reform, and I called on the Congress to act by 
July 4, 1997. Passage of effective finance reform must be a priority for 
this Congress, but we will succeed only if citizens all across the 
country make clear to elected officials that change is urgent and that 
public support is broad and deep. Project Independence can help break 
the logjam that has blocked reform for so long. By building support for 
the McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bills, 
Project Independence will give citizens a voice as we work to reform our 
politics and renew our democracy.
