Statement on Congressional Action on Emergency Funding for Hurricane 
Katrina Recovery Efforts
September 8, 2005

    I thank Congress for continuing to help those affected by Hurricane 
Katrina by moving swiftly and in strong bipartisan fashion to approve 
these additional emergency funds. The people affected by this storm have 
immediate needs that we must continue to meet without delay. More 
resources will be needed as we work to help people get back on their 
feet. We will continue to help people rebuild their lives and rebuild 
the region.
