Message to the Senate Transmitting the Lithuania-United States 
Extradition Treaty
May 6, 2002

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Republic of Lithuania, signed at Vilnius on October 23, 2001.
    In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of modern extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States 
and will replace the Extradition Treaty of April 9, 1924, between the 
two countries and the Supplementary Extradition Treaty of May 17, 1934. 
In conjunction with the new U.S.-Lithuania Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty that took effect in 1999, the Treaty will, upon entry into force, 
enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of the two 
countries. It will thereby make a significant contribution to 
international law enforcement efforts against serious offenses, 
including terrorism, organized crime, and drug-trafficking offenses.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 May 6, 2002.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
May 7.
