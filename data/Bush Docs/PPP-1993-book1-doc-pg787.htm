Memorandum on Trade Agreements
May 31, 1993

Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative

Subject: Presidential Determination Under Section 1105(b)(1) of the 
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988

    Section 1105(b)(1) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 
1988 (Public Law 100-48; 19 U.S.C. 2904(b)(1)) (``the Act''), provides 
that the President shall determine, before June 1, 1993, whether any 
major industrial country has failed to make concessions under trade 
agreements entered into under section 1102(a) and (b) of the Act (19 
U.S.C. 2902(a) and (b)) which provide opportunities for the commerce of 
the United States in such country substantially equivalent to the 
competitive opportunities, provided by concessions made by the United 
States under trade agreements entered into under section 1102(a) and (b) 
of the Act, for the commerce of such country in the United States.
    Since the United States has not entered into any agreements under 
section 1102(a) or (b) of the Act, I hereby determine that there has 
been no failure to make concessions thereunder.

                                                      William J. Clinton
