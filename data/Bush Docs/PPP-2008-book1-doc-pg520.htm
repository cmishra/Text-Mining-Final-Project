Message to the Congress on Extending Generalized System of Preferences 
Benefits to the Solomon Islands
April 17, 2008

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 502(f)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (the ``Act''), I am providing notification of my intent to add 
the Solomon Islands to the list of least-developed beneficiary 
developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) 
program. In Executive Order 12302 of April 1, 1981, the Solomon Islands 
was designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the 
GSP program. After considering the criteria set forth in sections 501 
and 502 of the Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to extend 
least-developed beneficiary developing country benefits to the Solomon 
Islands.

                                                          George W. Bush

The White House,

April 17, 2008.
