    The President today announced his intention to nominate Washington 
attorney Steven M.H. Wallman to be a member of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.

securities law and has been actively engaged in the fight for sensible 
regulation in that area,'' said the President. ``He will make an 
excellent addition to the SEC.''
