Statement on the Announcement of a Bipartisan Agreement on Medicare 
Legislation
November 15, 2003

    The bipartisan Medicare agreement announced today by leaders in 
Congress represents a significant achievement in our Nation's efforts to 
provide affordable prescription drug coverage for our seniors. Seniors 
have waited a long time for help in paying for prescription drugs, and I 
am pleased that we are now on the verge of providing them with the help 
they need and the health care choices they deserve. This bipartisan 
agreement is the most significant improvement in senior health care 
coverage in nearly 40 years. I applaud the hard work and the leadership 
from both sides of the aisle, and I urge the Congress to pass this 
legislation soon so I can sign it into law.
