Message to the Congress on Trade with Maldives and Moldova
July 28, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program offers duty-free 
treatment to specified products that are imported from designated 
beneficiary developing countries. The program is authorized by title V 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.
    Pursuant to title V, I have determined that Maldives should be 
suspended from the GSP program because it is not making sufficient 
progress in protecting basic labor rights. I also have decided to 
designate Moldova as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of 
the

GSP program because I have determined that Moldova satisfies the 
statutory criteria.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with the requirements of 
section 502(a)(1) and 502(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 28, 1995.

Note: The related proclamation is listed in Appendix D at the end of 
this volume.
