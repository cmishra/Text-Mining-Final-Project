Statement on Signing the United States-India Nuclear Cooperation 
Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act
October 8, 2008

    I am pleased today to sign into law the United States-India Nuclear 
Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act, which 
approves the U.S.-India 123 Agreement. The passage of this legislation 
by the Congress marks another major milestone in achieving the vision 
that Prime Minister Singh<Singh, Manmohan<ls-thn-eq> and I set forth on 
July 18, 2005, to transform the relationship between our two countries 
and to establish a strategic partnership. This act will strengthen the 
relationship between the United States and India and deliver valuable 
benefits to both nations.
    The legislation does not change the terms of the 123 Agreement as I 
submitted it to the Congress. That agreement is consistent with the 
Atomic Energy Act and other elements of U.S. law. This legislationis 
important as it enables me to bring the 123 Agreement into force and to 
accept on behalf of the United States the obligations contained in the 
agreement.
    The agreement grants India advance consent to reprocessing, which 
will be brought into effect upon conclusion of arrangements and 
procedures for a dedicated reprocessing facility under IAEA safeguards.
    In addition, the legislation does not change the fuel assurance 
commitments that the U.S. Government has made to the Government of 
India, as recorded in the 123 Agreement.
    The passage of this legislation reflects the common view of my 
administration and the Congress as to the value of nuclear cooperation 
and is in the interest of the United States and India.
