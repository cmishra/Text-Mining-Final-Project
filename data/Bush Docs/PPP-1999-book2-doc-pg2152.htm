Council. The Ulster Unionist decision today, which follows critical 
decisions by all the pro-agreement parties over the past several weeks, 
is an important move forward to full implementation of the Good Friday 
accord in all its aspects. Beginning next week, government in Northern 
Ireland is being put back directly in the hands of all the people. I 
welcome this progress and urge all parties to continue working together 
on building the foundations for lasting peace. I pledge the support of 
the United States to all those who are helping to make possible a 
brighter future for Northern Ireland.
