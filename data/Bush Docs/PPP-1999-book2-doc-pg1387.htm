Statement on Proposed Patients' Bill of Rights Legislation
August 5, 1999

    With today's announcement led by Drs. Ganske<Ganske, Greg> 
and Norwood<Norwood, Charlie> and Congressman 
Dingell,<Dingell, John D.> it is clear that there is now a 
bipartisan majority of House Members ready to vote for a strong and 
enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. Unlike the partisan Senate-passed 
bill, this bipartisan initiative is a Patients' Bill of Rights not just 
in name but in reality. It provides meaningful patient protections to 
all Americans in all health plans, and it holds plans accountable when 
their actions cause harm to patients.
    Today's action proves that patient protections need not and should 
not be a partisan issue. It is time to do what this bipartisan coalition 
has done, put the well-being of patients before politics and special 
interests. I call on Speaker Hastert<Hastert, J. Dennis> to 
schedule a vote on this long-overdue legislation immediately upon return 
from the congressional recess in September.
