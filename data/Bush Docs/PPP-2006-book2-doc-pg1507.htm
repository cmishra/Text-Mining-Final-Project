Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Secretary of Defense Donald H. 
Rumsfeld<Rumsfeld, Donald H.<ls-thn-eq> and the Defense Policy and 
Programs Team in Arlington, Virginia
August 14, 2006

    Mr. Secretary, thanks for having me. The national security team from 
the White House is anxious to come over and get a briefing from you. 
We've got a lot to discuss. It's very important for the American people 
to know that we're constantly thinking about how to secure the homeland, 
protect our interests, and use all assets available to do our jobs.
    I appreciate very much you and your team providing the very 
important briefing. We live in troubled times, but I'm confident in our 
capacity to not only protect the homeland, but I'm confident in our 
capacity to leave behind a better world. And one reason I feel so 
confident is because we've got a fantastic military. It's been an honor 
to travel the country to meet those who wear the uniform. We're a 
blessed nation to have men and women who are willing to volunteer during 
these difficult times.
    And so, Mr. Secretary, thanks for the briefing; I'm looking forward 
to it. And thank you all for giving us your insights and inputs.

Note: The President spoke at 9:27 a.m. at the Pentagon. The Office of 
the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of these 
remarks.
