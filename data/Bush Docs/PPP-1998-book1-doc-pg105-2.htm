Remarks at the White House Endowment Dinner
January 21, 1998

    Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? This will be 
a brief program, because we want you to have a wonderful time tonight at 
the White House. We thank you for doing so much to support the White 
House Endowment Fund and for your commitment to

ensuring that this house, the people's house, remains the pride of our 
people well into the next millennium.
    No one has been more committed to making sure that this house is for 
all of our people than the First Lady.<Clinton, Hillary 
Rodham<ls-thn-eq> Over the past 5 years, Hillary has worked so hard to 
showcase the talent and creativity of all Americans in each of these 
grand and historic rooms, from refurbishing the Blue Room to securing 
the first painting by an African-American, or the first painting by 
Georgia O'Keefe for the White House's permanent collection. Her 
contributions to this house will remain a long time after we're gone 
from Washington.
    Let me say it was in no small part because of her dedication that 
the 1.5 million visitors who walk through the White House every single 
year have been able to enjoy the richness and diversity of America's 
cultural heritage. I thank her for her leadership and for making this 
house on all floors a more wonderful and truly historic place to live.
    And now, in reverse of the usual order, it is my pleasure and honor 
to introduce the First Lady of the United States.

Note: The President spoke at 8:05 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House.
