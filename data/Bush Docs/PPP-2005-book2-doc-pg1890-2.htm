Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa 2005
December 19, 2005

    I send greetings to those observing Kwanzaa.
    African Americans and people around the world reflect on African 
heritage during

[[Page 1891]]

Kwanzaa. The seven days of this celebration emphasize the seven 
principles of Nguzo Saba--unity, self-determination, collective work and 
responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. 
These values contribute to a culture of citizenship and compassion, and 
Kwanzaa activities help pass on African values and traditions to future 
generations.
    As families and friends gather for Kwanzaa, Americans remember the 
many contributions African Americans have made to our country's 
character and celebrate the diversity that makes our Nation strong. May 
your commitment to family, faith, and community thrive during this 
holiday season and throughout the coming year.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a happy 
Kwanzaa.

                                                          George W. Bush
