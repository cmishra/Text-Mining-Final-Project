Statement on the Death of Zachary Fisher<Fisher, Zachary>
June 4, 1999

    Hillary and I are saddened to hear of the death of Zachary Fisher. 
The brave men and women of the United States military have lost a true 
friend, and America has lost a true patriot.
    Over the years, thousands of military families were touched by Mr. 
Fisher's generosity: he provided scholarships for college; built 
``Fisher Houses'' near military and VA hospitals so that families could 
be close to sick or injured loved ones; and established New York's 
Intrepid Museum so that future generations could be inspired by 
America's military history.
    Through these good works, Mr. Fisher helped all Americans repay the 
tremendous debt we owe to the men and women who every day risk their 
lives to defend our Nation and advance the cause of freedom around the 
world. I was proud to present him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
last fall. Mr. Fisher's memory will continue to inspire all Americans.
    Hillary and I send our thoughts and prayers to his family and 
friends.
