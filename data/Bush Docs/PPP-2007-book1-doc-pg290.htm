Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony in Guatemala City, Guatemala
March 12, 2007

    President Oscar Berger Perdomo of Guatemala.<Berger Perdomo, 
Oscar<ls-thn-eq> Dear friends, welcome all. On behalf of my Government 
and on behalf of the people of Guatemala, I am pleased to welcome 
President George W. Bush, his wife, and his distinguished delegation in 
our country.
    We celebrate that President Bush decided to include Guatemala in his 
tour throughout Latin America. We welcome you with affection in this 
multiethnic and plurilingual country, where--[inaudible]--cultures live 
together, with strong features of modernity, and where, after a lengthy 
and painful conflict that divided us during 40 years, we are, with 
determination, following the path of reconciliation, in search for 
building a plural, democratic, tolerant, and participatory society.
    Our historic relationship with the United States of America, at 
times troubled, date far back. We are pleased to confirm that in recent 
decades this relationship matured and is today characterized by a 
further interaction that are respectful and broad in scope.
    We share values, including, of course, representative democracy and 
social justice. We also share interests that grew last year with the 
entry into force of the free trade agreement between the Central 
American countries and the Dominican Republic on the one hand, and the 
United States of America on the other hand.
    And we would be remiss if we do not recall that at present it is 
estimated that approximately 10 percent of our population live in the 
United States of America, upon the integration of the labor markets of 
both nations.
    As is the case in every mature relationship, once in a while 
differences of opinion arise, for example, with regard to the issue of 
migrants, in particularly those who have been deported without clear 
justification. But as is also the case in every mature relationship, 
what brings us together exceeds by far those differences. We value that 
relationship, and we shall make effort

in order to enhance and extend it, as we shall make effort to address 
the differences that we find between us with a constructive spirit.
    We shall take advantage of our conversations today, that will take 
place within a framework of cordiality and openness, to address topics 
of mutual interest--fighting poverty, respect for human rights, and a 
frontal fight against organized crime, as well as Central America's 
economic integration. We shall also review the strengths and weaknesses 
of our own evolution since the signature of our peace accord.
    I finish by reiterating our recognition to President Bush for his 
persistence in having been able to put forth the free trade agreement, 
and also for his initiative to promote an integrated migratory reform, 
that we would trust will culminate with your approval, Mr. President. 
These two initiatives will certainly contribute to bring our two nations 
even closer together.
    Once again, President Bush; First Lady, Madam Laura Bush; and 
members of your delegation: Welcome to Guatemala.
    President Bush. Senor Presidente,<Berger Perdomo, Oscar<ls-thn-eq> 
gracias por su bienvenidos a este pais, pais bella. I thank you and the 
First Lady<Widmann de Berger, Wendy<ls-thn-eq> for treating Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and me with such grand hospitality. This is my first 
official visit to Guatemala, and we thank the people of this country for 
their magnificent hospitality.
    I'm honored to stand in the historic courtyard where the 1996 peace 
accords were signed. The accords mark the end of 36 years of internal 
conflict and the beginning of a more hopeful future for Guatemala.
    Guatemala is a proud country with a rich culture. This morning, 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I toured the highlands where the 
ancient Mayans built a great civilization many centuries ago. This 
beautiful land is now the home of Central America's largest democracy. 
You have built a diverse and vibrant nation, and the people of the 
United States admire your determination and your resilience.
    Our two countries share many values. We both believe good 
governments must be accountable to the people they serve and subject to 
the rule of law. We both believe free enterprise and hard work help lead 
to prosperity, and we both believe our nations have a responsibility to 
spread opportunity and advance the cause of social justice.
    The United States and Guatemala are partners in this important work. 
We're working together to improve access to education and health care to 
give Guatemalans a safe and legal path to jobs in the United States and 
to lift millions of people out of poverty by expanding trade. The ties 
between our two countries have never been stronger or more important.
    Mr. President,<Berger Perdomo, Oscar<ls-thn-eq> Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I appreciate the invitation to visit your country. 
We appreciate the time we spent with you and your very accomplished 
wife.<Widmann de Berger, Wendy<ls-thn-eq> You're a man of vision and 
courage. You understand that real leadership requires making tough 
choices that serve your nation well in the long term.
    I appreciate your unwavering commitment to your people, Mr. 
President,<Berger Perdomo, Oscar<ls-thn-eq> and I look forward to 
working with you to build a better future for both our countries.
    Muchas gracias, mi amigo.

Note: The President spoke at 1:55 p.m. on the Patio de la Paz at the 
National Palace. In his remarks, he referred to Wendy Widmann de Berger, 
wife of President Berger. President Berger spoke in Spanish, and his 
remarks were translated by an interpreter. The Office of the Press 
Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of these remarks.
