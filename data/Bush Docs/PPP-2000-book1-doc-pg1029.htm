Statement on the Memorial Day National Moment of Remembrance
May 25, 2000

    I am very pleased by the House and Senate's joint action to offer 
formal support to the Memorial Day National Moment of Remembrance. The 
recently passed House Concurrent Resolution 302 and Senate Concurrent 
Resolution 100 have established the National Moment of Remembrance as an 
important part of this year's program to honor those Americans who died 
while defending our Nation and its values. Earlier this month I directed 
all executive departments and agencies to recognize and promote a 
National Moment of Remembrance on Memorial Day.
    The National Moment of Remembrance asks each American to pause for 
one minute at 3 p.m. local time on Monday, May 29th to reflect and 
remember the sacrifices made by our fallen heroes. This simple, brief 
reflection asks little compared with what we have asked of our 
servicemen and women. With our united, solemn action, we honor and pay 
tribute to our Nation's heroes.
    I wish to commend and thank Congressmen Dana 
Rohrabacher<Rohrabacher, Dana<ls-thn-eq> and John Murtha<Murtha, John 
P.<ls-thn-eq> and Senators Chuck Hagel<Hagel, Chuck<ls-thn-eq> and Bob 
Kerrey<Kerrey, J. Robert<ls-thn-eq> for cosponsoring these concurrent 
resolutions. Their leadership and initiative are visible examples of how 
we as Americans can work in unison to honor our cherished history. I ask 
all Americans to join with Congress in pausing to observe this National 
Moment of Remembrance.
