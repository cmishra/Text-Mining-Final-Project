    President Bush. This man is doing a great job, and we're proud to 
call him friend. He believes in freedom and peace. And I really 
appreciate what you've done, sir.
    Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer. Thank you. It's a challenge, but 
NATO is worth it.
    President Bush. It is worth it.
    Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer. NATO is worth it, and the 
transatlantic relationship is worth it, more than just in words but all 
in deeds.
    President Bush. Right. I was hoping to change the mission of NATO so 
it meets the threats of the 21st century, and we're going to work 
together to help make sure NATO is configured militarily to meet the 
threats of the 21st century as well. But you're the right man for the 
job, and we're honored you took it. I really appreciate working with 
you.
    Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer. We're defending values, and 
values never come out. And I think they should be defended every single 
day and every single hour. We see examples of that everywhere around 
that NATO is--it's about values, has always been about values, and it's 
still about values. But Turkey has changed. We have terrorism 
everywhere. There's fights everywhere, be it here in this city, be it in 
New York, Uzbekistan, Mombasa, Yemen, you name it. This Alliance has to 
participate in fighting it first and winning it.
    President Bush. Thank you.

Kidnaping of Turks

    Q. Does the kidnaping of the Turks cast a pall over this meeting?

[President Bush responded to the question by shaking his head to 
indicate no.]

Note: The President spoke at 5:04 p.m. at the Hilton Istanbul. A tape 
was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
