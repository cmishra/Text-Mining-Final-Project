Joint Statement on Cooperation in Promoting the Rule of Law and
Combating Crime
September 28, 1994

    President Boris Yeltsin and President William Clinton, during their 
meeting in Washington on September 27 and 28, 1994, noted the threat 
which crime poses to the Russian and American societies and to the 
entire international community. Of particular concern to the Presidents 
was the rise in financial crime, nuclear materials smuggling, organized 
crime, and drug trafficking. They agreed that bilateral and 
international cooperative efforts would be necessary to combat this 
growing threat.

    The Presidents noted that cooperation in law enforcement between 
their two countries could in a substantial way help to resolve the 
problem of crime and should be institutionalized through bilateral 
agreements. To this end, delegations from the United States and the 
Russian Federation held a first round of negotiations for an Agreement 
on Cooperation in Criminal Matters which commits each country to assist 
the other in criminal investigations and crime prevention. The 
Presidents expressed their intention to sign and bring into force as 
quickly as possible this Agreement. The Presidents also announced their 
intention to enter into negotiations for a broader Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty.
    President Clinton announced the intention of the United States to 
offer an expanded program of assistance to the Russian Federation, 
including technical assistance and training of personnel to support 
cooperation between the Russian Federation and the United States in 
promoting the rule of law and combating crime.
