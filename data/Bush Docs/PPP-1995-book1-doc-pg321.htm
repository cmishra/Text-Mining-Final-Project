Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Pakistan
March 8, 1995

    The attack on American diplomatic personnel in Pakistan today 
outrages all Americans. I have instructed relevant U.S. Government 
agencies to work with the Government of Pakistan to apprehend the 
perpetrators of this cowardly act. I want to thank the Government of 
Pakistan for the excellent cooperation it has already provided.
    Our hearts go out to the families of Gary Durell, a communicator, 
and Jacqueline van Landingham, a consulate secretary, who were killed. 
We pray for the speedy recovery of Mark McCloy, a consulate spouse, who 
was wounded.
    Attacks such as these should make the international community 
rededicate itself to efforts to stamp out terrorism everywhere.
