Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Request for Additional Funds To Support Recovery Efforts in the Gulf 
Coast
February 16, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst natural disasters in our 
Nation's history. Katrina devastated an area roughly the size of Great 
Britain. This devastation has required an unprecedented response by 
Federal, State, and local governments, as well as the private sector. So 
far, the Federal Government has committed more than $87 billion in 
spending and $8 billion in tax relief for the people of the Gulf Coast 
and New Orleans.
    To provide additional resources to assist the region in its 
recovery, I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests, totaling 
$19.8 billion. This request includes critical funding to: replenish the 
Department of Homeland Security's Disaster Relief Fund in support of 
ongoing response efforts; support the Small Business Administration's 
Disaster Loan program; provide funding for the Community Development 
Block Grant program to support Louisiana's flood mitigation plans; 
achieve my commitment through the Corps of Engineers for stronger and 
better levee protection for New Orleans; and continue rebuilding of the 
region's Federal infrastructure.
    I urge the Congress to act expeditiously on this request to ensure 
that the Federal response and recovery efforts continue uninterrupted. I 
designate this proposal in the amount requested herein as an emergency 
requirement.

    The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
