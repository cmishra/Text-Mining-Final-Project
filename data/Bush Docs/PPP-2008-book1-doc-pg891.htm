Statement on the Situation in Zimbabwe
June 28, 2008

    On Friday, the Mugabe<Mugabe, Robert<ls-thn-eq> regime held a sham 
election that ignored the will of the people of Zimbabwe. The 
international community has condemned the Mugabe regime's ruthless 
campaign of politically motivated violence and intimidation with a 
strong and unified voice that makes clear that yesterday's election was 
in no way free and fair. Any legitimate Government of Zimbabwe must 
represent the interests of all its citizens and the outcome of the March 
29 elections.
    Given the Mugabe<Mugabe, Robert<ls-thn-eq> regime's blatant 
disregard for the Zimbabwean people's democratic will and human rights, 
I am instructing the Secretaries of State<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> 
and Treasury<Paulson, Henry M., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> to develop sanctions 
against this illegitimate Government of Zimbabwe and those who support 
it. We will press for strong action by the United Nations, including an 
arms embargo on Zimbabwe and travel ban on regime officials. We will 
continue to work closely with the African Union, Southern African 
Development Community, and other world leaders to resolve this crisis.
    The United States stands ready to support a legitimate government 
through a robust package of development assistance, debt relief, and 
normalization with international financial institutions. In the 
meantime, we will continue to support the people of Zimbabwe by 
providing food assistance to more than 1 million people and AIDS 
treatment to more than 40,000 people.

Note: The statement referred to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
