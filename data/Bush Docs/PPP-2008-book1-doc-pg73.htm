Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony in Manama, Bahrain
January 12, 2008

    Your Majesty,<King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa<ls-thn-eq> thank you 
very much for bestowing upon me the award. I'm most honored. I accept it 
on behalf of the people of the United States of America. I also thank 
you and the Crown Prince<Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa al-
Khalifa<ls-thn-eq> and the Prime Minister<Khalifa bin Salman al-
Khalifa<ls-thn-eq> for your gracious hospitality. I am really honored to 
be the first U.S. sitting President to have visited your country. 
Perhaps I should say, it's about time.
    The American people have a long friendship with the people of 
Bahrain. For decades, Bahrain has welcomed the United States Navy and is 
now home to our 5th Fleet. Two years ago, I was pleased to sign 
legislation that strengthened our friendship and our relationship. It 
was the free trade agreement with Bahrain; it's America's first such 
agreement with any nation in the Gulf. This agreement is helping to pave 
way to freer and fairer trade between our countries so we can create 
jobs and opportunity and hope in both our lands.
    Our two nations share a common vision for the future of the Middle 
East. Through our alliance, we share the burdens and risks of 
maintaining security as well as defending freedom throughout the region. 
We also believe in the power of democratic reform. Your Majesty,<King 
Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa<ls-thn-eq> I appreciate the fact that you're on 
the forefront of providing hope for people through democracy. Your 
nation has held two free elections since 2000. And in 2006, your people 
elected a woman<al-Geood, Lateefa<ls-thn-eq> to your parliament. 
Bahrain's reforms are making your nation stronger. You're showing strong 
leadership, and you're showing the way forward for other nations.
    Your Majesty,<King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa<ls-thn-eq> I look 
forward to our meetings later today. I look forward to discussing how we 
continue--can continue to advance peace in the Middle East. I look 
forward to sharing with you my experiences that I had in Israel and the 
Palestinian Territories. I look forward to talking about how we can 
continue to ensure security in the Gulf. Together, we will continue to 
strengthen our friendship and our cooperation, and I'm proud to be with 
you, sir.

Note: The President spoke at 3:55 p.m. at Sakhir Palace. In his remarks, 
he referred to King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, Crown Prince Sheikh Salman 
bin Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, and Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman al-
Khalifa of Bahrain. He also referred to Lateefa al-Geood, who was the 
first woman elected to the Council of Representatives of the National 
Assembly of Bahrain in 2006.
