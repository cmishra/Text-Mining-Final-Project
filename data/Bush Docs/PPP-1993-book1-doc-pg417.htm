Nomination for Ambassadorial Posts
April 7, 1993

    The President announced today his nomination of Marshall McCallie to 
be Ambassador to Namibia, and his intention to nominate John Schmidt to 
the rank of Ambassador during his tenure of service as the Uruguay Round 
Coordinator. In that position, Mr. Schmidt will be the chief U.S. 
negotiator for the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade.
    ``These are two key appointments,'' said the President. ``The 
Uruguay round of the GATT talks is vital to our hopes for freer and 
fairer trade in the world. Likewise, our relationship with Namibia is 
key as we seek to promote democracy in southern Africa. I am very happy 
with the choices of John Schmidt and Marshall McCallie to fill those 
roles.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
