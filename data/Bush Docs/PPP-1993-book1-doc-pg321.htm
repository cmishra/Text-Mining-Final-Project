Nomination for Deputy Secretary of Transportation
March 18, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Mortimer L. 
Downey, the Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer of the 
Metropolitan Transit Authority of New York City, to be the Deputy 
Secretary of Transportation.
    ``There are few people in this country who can match the experience 
or the expertise of Mortimer Downey,'' said the President. ``I am very 
pleased that he is joining Secretary Pena at a Department that will play 
a key role in implementing my economic plan, as well as in improving our 
Nation's transportation system.''

Press Secretary.
