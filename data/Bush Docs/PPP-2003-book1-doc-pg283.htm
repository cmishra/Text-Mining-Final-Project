Message on the Observance of Nowruz
March 20, 2003

    I send greetings to Iranian Americans observing Nowruz.
    During Nowruz, people of Iranian descent celebrate the arrival of 
spring, a season of rebirth. This joyous occasion provides an 
opportunity for Persians to cherish their rich heritage and enjoy the 
company of family and friends in anticipation of happiness and blessings 
in the year ahead.
    This year's observance comes during a challenging time for our 
Nation and the world. As the international community works to face great 
challenges and embrace important opportunities, America remains 
committed to peace, justice, and opportunity for all people. Throughout 
this time of renewal, we remain dedicated to bringing hope and freedom 
to troubled regions around the world.
    Laura<Bush, Laura> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a joyous celebration to you, your families, and your relatives and 
friends in Iran.

                                                          George W. Bush
