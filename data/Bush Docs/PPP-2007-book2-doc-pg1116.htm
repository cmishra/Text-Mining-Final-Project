Statement on the Death of Police Officer Germaine Casey<Casey, 
Germaine<ls-thn-eq>
August 27, 2007

    Officer Germaine Casey of the Rio Rancho Police Department died 
today from injuries suffered while serving as a member of my security 
detail in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I am deeply saddened by his death and 
extraordinarily grateful for his protection. It is a high calling to 
choose to serve and protect your fellow citizens, and I will always be 
indebted to Officer Casey's service.
    He leaves behind his wife Lisa<Casey, Lisa<ls-thn-eq> and their two 
children. They are in my thoughts and prayers. May God comfort the Casey 
family and his fellow law enforcement officials.
