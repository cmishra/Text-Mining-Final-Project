Statement on the Executive Order on Identification of Trade Expansion 
Priorities
March 3, 1994

    This administration is committed to opening markets for high-quality 
goods and services produced by competitive American workers. That was 
the goal of NAFTA, the GATT negotiations, the APEC conference, the U.S.-
Japan framework talks, and a number of other steps my administration has 
taken. Today I have signed an Executive order reinstituting Super 301. 
This action will help us reach our objective: open markets that will 
create better jobs and increase wages at home and abroad.

Note: The Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
