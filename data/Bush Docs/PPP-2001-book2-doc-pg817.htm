Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to the Taliban
June 30, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the emergency declared with respect to the Taliban, is to continue in 
effect beyond July 4, 2001.
    The Taliban continues to allow territory under its control in 
Afghanistan to be used as a safe haven and base of operations for Usama 
bin Laden and the al-Qaida organization who have committed, and threaten 
to continue to commit, acts of violence against the United States and 
its nationals. This situation continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy 
interests of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined 
that it is necessary to maintain these emergency authorities in force 
beyond July 4, 2001.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
July 2. The notice of June 30 was published in the Federal Register at 
66 FR 35363.
