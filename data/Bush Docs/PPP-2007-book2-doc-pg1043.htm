Statement on Senate Passage of Intelligence Reform Legislation
August 4, 2007

    Last night the United States Senate passed legislation to give our 
intelligence professionals the legal tools and authority they need to 
keep America safe. I appreciate the hard work they did to find common 
ground to pass this critical bill. Today the House of Representatives 
has an opportunity to consider that bill, pass it, and send it to me for 
my signature. Protecting America is our most solemn obligation, and I 
urge the House to pass this bill without delay.

Note: The statement referred to S. 1927.
