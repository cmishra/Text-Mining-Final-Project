Statement on the Environmental Protection Agency Proposal To Reduce 
Emissions From Trucks and Buses
May 17, 2000

    The measures proposed today by the Environmental Protection Agency 
to reduce harmful emissions from trucks and buses represent another 
major milestone in this administration's long-standing effort to ensure 
cleaner, healthier air for all Americans.
    Air pollution has declined dramatically over the past quarter 
century, but stronger action is needed to protect public health and keep 
us on track to meeting our Nation's air quality goals. That is why last 
year I announced tough new tailpipe and fuel standards to dramatically 
reduce emissions from cars, SUV's, and other light-duty trucks. Today's 
proposal would establish stringent new standards for heavy-duty trucks 
and buses and the diesel fuel that powers them. These proposed standards 
would produce the cleanest trucks and buses ever, significantly reducing 
smog, soot, and other pollutants that contribute to asthma and other 
respiratory disease.
    Americans today enjoy the cleanest environment in a generation and 
the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. I am confident 
that today's proposal--which will be refined in the coming months with 
input from the public, industry, and the environmental community--will 
produce even greater benefits for both our economy and our environment.
