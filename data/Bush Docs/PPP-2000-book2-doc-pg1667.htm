Statement Announcing the Appointment of the Presidential Envoy for AIDS 
Cooperation
August 15, 2000

    Today I am pleased to name Sandra L. Thurman<Thurman, Sandra 
L.> Presidential Envoy for AIDS Cooperation--the first U.S. 
Envoy to deal exclusively with a global health issue.
    AIDS is now the leading cause of death in Africa and increasingly 
threatens Asia and the former Soviet Union. It is reversing hard-won 
advances in life expectancy and economic growth and imperils the 
stability and security of nations.
    Sandy Thurman<Thurman, Sandra L.> has joined the battle 
against AIDS in every capacity from community activist to national 
policy director to international policy advocate.
    Since I appointed her<Thurman, Sandra L.> Director of the 
White House Office of National AIDS Policy--a position she will retain--
she has traveled repeatedly to Africa and met many leaders including 
former President Mandela<Mandela, Nelson> of South Africa, 
President Museveni<Museveni, Yoweri K.> of Uganda, and 
President Obasanjo<Obasanjo, Olusegun> of Nigeria. She led the 
U.S. delegation to the International AIDS conference in Durban and 
cochaired its session on prevention.
    Sandy<Thurman, Sandra L.> will be an inspiring envoy. She 
combines the passion of an advocate with the skill of a diplomat.
    One of her<Turman, Sandra L.> top priorities as AIDS 
Policy Director was to expand America's commitment to

fighting global AIDS. Now Sandy will use America's growing efforts as 
leverage to encourage other countries to expand financial commitments, 
to step up prevention efforts, and to increase access to care and 
treatment worldwide. Sandy has an extraordinary record of service on 
this issue, and I am proud to make her America's first envoy in the 
global fight against AIDS.
