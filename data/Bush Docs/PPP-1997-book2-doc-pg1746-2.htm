Presidential Citizens Medal Citation for Elinor Guggenheimer
December 10, 1997

    For the past 50 years, Elinor Guggenheimer has been a tenacious and 
effective champion on behalf of America's children. She began her 
crusade by persuading New York City to assume funding of Federal day 
care centers following World War II. Later, as founding President of the 
Child Care Action Campaign, she helped to elevate day care to a national 
concern. Throughout a lifetime of service, she has expanded the focus of 
her advocacy and generously lent her talents to issues that confront 
seniors, women, and consumers. Elly Guggenheimer's indomitable spirit 
and extraordinary efforts to improve the lives of her fellow citizens 
have helped to illuminate our common path to a better America.

                                                      William J. Clinton
