Veterans Day

    As you can see, I have the honor of traveling<Cox, 
Shenequa<ls-thn-eq> with<Hutto, Christopher O.<ls-thn-eq> men<Noyce 
Merino, Michael<ls-thn-eq> and<Goetschel, Alicia<ls-thn-eq> women<Badon, 
John<ls-thn-eq> who have volunteered to serve our Nation in a time of 
war. Behind me are five outstanding Americans representing each branch 
of the military service. I am with them today because we are celebrating 
Veterans Day.
    Veterans have inspired troops such as these; veterans have inspired 
me. I was raised by a veteran.<Bush, George H.W.<ls-thn-eq> I appreciate 
the commitment to our country that the veterans have made. I am 
committed to making sure that today's veterans get all the health care 
and support they need from the Federal Government for agreeing to serve 
in a time of danger.
    Our Nation is blessed because our liberties have been defended by 
brave men and women in the past. And we are blessed to have brave men 
and women defend our liberties today.
    God bless our veterans. Thank you.
