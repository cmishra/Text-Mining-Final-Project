Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Education Leaders and an 
Exchange With Reporters
January 23, 2001

    The President. Good morning. I want to welcome you all. I 
particularly want to welcome senior Members of the Senate and the House. 
We're here today to discuss a domestic policy issue of high importance, 
and that's public education, how to make sure every child in America 
gets educated.
    I've always said that public schools, the common schools, issues 
related to public schools are not a Republican issue or Democrat issue; 
it's an American issue. And we'll agree on things. We won't agree on 
things. But we'll always agree that making sure every child is educated 
is of national importance. It is a major priority. There's a role for 
the Federal Government. There's a role for the State government. There's 
a role for local governments. And part of our discussions and eventual 
legislation will recognize those roles.
    And I'm so honored that the Senators came over and Members of the 
House, the leadership, that's going to help carry legislation. I believe 
the best way for the Vice President and I to help the legislative 
process is to discuss issues in a frank and open way, and that's the 
beginning of a process here.
    So thank you all for coming. I'm honored you're here.

Campaign Finance Reform

    Q. Mr. President, Senator McCain yesterday said that he has a 
mandate. Do you agree with him, that he has a mandate? And if so, what--
--
    The President. I'm going to meet with the Senator<McCain, 
John<ls-thn-eq> tomorrow night to discuss

issues of concern for him. I suspect one of them might be campaign 
funding reform. But I'll let you know how the conversation goes. I'm 
confident it's going to be friendly and productive. John and I are 
friends. I remember we debated this issue several times. I think you 
might have been there.
    Q. Do you think he has a mandate?
    The President. And I think there's a need to discuss good campaign 
funding reform, and we will.

Legislative Agenda on Education

    Q. How much of a sticking point for Democrats do you think your 
school choice or voucher program is? And are you willing to give ground 
in order to get a broader deal?
    The President. I think that there is consensus on a couple of 
things: One, accountability is the cornerstone for reform; and secondly, 
in order for there to be an accountability system that's got merit, 
there has to be a consequence. And that's what we're going to discuss. 
Representative Miller<Miller, George<ls-thn-eq> from the State of 
California understands that accountability is crucial for success. And 
so does Boehner,<Boehner, John A.<ls-thn-eq> and I hope the Senators do. 
I haven't had a chance to speak specifically with Senator 
Kennedy<Kennedy, Edward M.<ls-thn-eq> yet. I'm about to.
    But we've got to measure, and there needs to be flexibility at the 
local level to make sure that local folks can chart the path of 
excellence. But in order for an accountability system to work, there has 
to be consequences. And I believe one of the most important consequences 
will be, after a period of time, giving schools the time to adjust and 
districts time to try different things if they're failing, that parents 
ought to be given different options.
    If children are trapped in schools that will not teach and will not 
change, there has to be a different consequence. None of us at the 
Federal Government should try to impose a school voucher plan on States 
and local jurisdictions. That's not the prerogative of the Federal 
Government, as far as I'm concerned. But to the extent that the Federal 
Government spends money, we ought to expect good results and good 
consequences.
    Q. Thank you.
    The President. I can't tell you what a pleasure it is.

California Electricity Shortages

    Q. [Inaudible]--to do about the California crisis?
    The President. You'll hear something today.

Note: The President spoke at 9:20 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Representative George Miller. A 
tape was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
