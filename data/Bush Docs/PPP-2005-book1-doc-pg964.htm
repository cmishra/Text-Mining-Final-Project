Statement on Senate Confirmation of Judges for the United States Court 
of Appeals
June 9, 2005

    I am pleased that the Senate voted today to confirm three 
distinguished and highly qualified judges to the United States Court of 
Appeals: Judge Bill Pryor,<Pryor, William H., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Judge 
Richard Griffin,<Griffin, Richard A.<ls-thn-eq> and Judge David 
McKeague.<McKeague, David W.<ls-thn-eq>
    More than a year ago, I recess appointed Judge Pryor<Pryor, William 
H., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> to the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Eleventh Circuit to fill a vacancy that had been designated a judicial 
emergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Judge Pryor's 
recent service on the Eleventh Circuit has built on an impressive career 
of public service in which he has applied the law fairly and impartially 
to all people. I commend the Senate for fulfilling its constitutional 
responsibility to vote on Judge Pryor and for confirming him so that he 
will continue his service on this court.
    Both Judge Griffin<Griffin, Richard A.<ls-thn-eq> and Judge 
McKeague<McKeague, David W.<ls-thn-eq> have served on the Michigan 
courts for more than a decade, during which time each has demonstrated a 
strong commitment to the rule of law. Both are well qualified to serve 
on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and will 
fill vacancies that have been designated judicial emergencies by the 
Judicial Conference of the United States.
    These<McKeague, David W.<ls-thn-eq> three<Griffin, Richard 
A.<ls-thn-eq> nominees<Pryor, William H., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> have waited a 
combined total of over 8 years for their votes. I applaud the Senate for 
today giving these fine nominees the up-or-down votes they deserve.
