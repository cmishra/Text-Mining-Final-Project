Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Development of Iranian Petroleum Resources
March 8, 1996

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency declared on March 15, 
1995, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701-1706) is to continue in effect beyond March 15, 1996, to the 
Federal Register for publication. This emergency is separate from that 
declared on November 14, 1979, in connection with the Iranian hostage 
crisis and therefore requires separate renewal of emergency authorities.
    The factors that led me to declare a national emergency with respect 
to Iran on March 15, 1995, have not been resolved. The actions and 
policies of the Government of Iran, including its support for 
international terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace 
process, and its acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the 
means to deliver them, continue to threaten the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Accordingly, I have 
determined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad 
authorities that are in place by virtue of the March 15, 1995, 
declaration of emergency.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

March 8, 1996.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
