Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
May 18, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period February 1-March 31, 2000. The 
previous submission covered events during December 1999 and January 
2000.
    As noted in my last submission, the United Nations has held two 
sessions of proximity talks, December 3-14, 1999, in New York and 
January 31-February 8 in Geneva. The next session of talks was scheduled 
to begin on May 23 in New York. This session will likely be postponed 
several weeks to allow President Clerides time to recover from surgery 
on May 5.
    The United States, under the guidance of my Special Presidential 
Emissary Alfred H. Moses and Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas G. 
Weston, has been actively engaged in supporting the United Nations 
effort to bring about a comprehensive Cyprus settlement. Ambassador 
Moses and his team were present during the Geneva talks and afterwards 
traveled to Cyprus in March to prepare for the next sessions of talks.
         Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
