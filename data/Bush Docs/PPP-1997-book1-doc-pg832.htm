Message to the Senate Transmitting the South Africa-United States 
Tax Convention
June 26, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of 
South Africa for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of 
Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains, signed 
at Cape Town February 17, 1997. Also transmitted is the report of the 
Department of State concerning the Convention.
    This Convention, which generally follows the U.S. model tax treaty, 
provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to various types of income 
and protection from double taxation of income. The Convention also 
provides for the exchange of information to prevent fiscal evasion and 
sets forth standard rules to limit the benefits of the Convention so 
that they are available only to residents that are not engaged in treaty 
shopping.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

June 26, 1997.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
June 27.
