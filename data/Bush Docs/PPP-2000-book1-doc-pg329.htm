Statement on Funding for Amtrak
February 28, 2000

    There has never been a better time to expand our investment in 
Amtrak and the Nation's passenger railways. The number of Americans 
relying on Amtrak has continued to grow for 3 years in a row. And 
through sound financial management, Amtrak continues its movement toward 
viability.
    Therefore, this year I am asking Congress to increase Amtrak funding 
by more than $400 million, or more than 70 percent, in order to make 
investments to expand Amtrak routes and provide even more efficient 
service, laying the foundation for high-speed rail. With this major 
funding increase this year, we can help ensure a thriving passenger rail 
system for many years to come.

Note: A portion of the President's statement was also made available on 
the White House Press Office Actuality Line.
