Statement on the Conclusion of Negotiations With India on a Bilateral 
Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation
July 27, 2007

    I welcome the conclusion of negotiations on a bilateral agreement 
between the United States and India for peaceful nuclear cooperation. I 
commend those from both countries who have worked hard to make this deal 
happen, and I look forward to working with Congress to realize this 
important initiative. This marks another step in the continued progress 
that is deepening our strategic partnership with India, a vital world 
leader.
