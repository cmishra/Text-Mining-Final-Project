Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Iran
November 11, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the 
Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice, stating that the 
Iran national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 of November 
14, 1979, is to continue in effect beyond November 14, 2008.
    Our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the 
process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is 
still underway. For these reasons, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, with respect to Iran, beyond November 14, 2008.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate.
