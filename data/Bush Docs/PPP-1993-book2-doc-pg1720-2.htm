    The President today announced his intention to nominate Wally B. 
Beyer, the general manager of a North Dakota electric cooperative for 
the past 30 years, as Administrator for the Rural Electrification 
Administration at the Department of Agriculture.
    ``With his many years working to provide electricity to rural 
Americans in North Dakota, Wally Beyer is exactly the type of person we 
need at the helm at the Rural Electrification Administration,'' the 
President said. ``I am pleased he has joined our team.''
