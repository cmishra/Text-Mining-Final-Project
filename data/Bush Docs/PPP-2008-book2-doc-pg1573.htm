Statement on the U.S. Airways Plane Crash in New York City
January 15, 2009

    My administration is coordinating with State and local officials to 
respond to this afternoon's plane crash in New York City. We continue to 
monitor the situation. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are inspired 
by the skill and heroism of the flight crew, as well as the dedication 
and selflessness of the emergency responders and volunteers who rescued 
passengers from the icy waters of the Hudson. We send our thoughts and 
prayers to all involved in the accident.
