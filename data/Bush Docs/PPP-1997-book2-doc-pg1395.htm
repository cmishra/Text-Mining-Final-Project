Statement on the Japan-United States Trade Agreement on Access to 
Japanese Ports
October 17, 1997

    I am pleased that our negotiators have reached an agreement in 
principle that will open trade in Japan's ports and level the playing 
field for American shippers. We have long pressed Japan for a firm 
commitment to liberalize trade in its ports, and today they have done 
just that. Japan has agreed to provide an expedited licensing process 
for American ships entering its ports and to support an alternative to 
the port services provided by the Japanese Harbor Transportation 
Authority. Those provisions, after the details are worked out, will 
allow America's shippers to compete and win in the global marketplace. I 
want to congratulate our negotiators for all of their hard work on 
behalf of America's businesses and workers.
