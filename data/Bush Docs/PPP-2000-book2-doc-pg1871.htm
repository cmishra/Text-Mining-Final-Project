Statement on Legislation To Establish a National Drunk Driving Standard
September 19, 2000

    A new study released today by Transportation Secretary Rodney 
Slater<Slater, Rodney E.> underscores the need for Congress to 
act swiftly to strengthen protections against drunk driving.
    The study by the U.S. Department of Transportation's National 
Highway Transportation Safety Administration makes clear that crucial 
driving skills are seriously impaired when an individual's blood alcohol 
content (BAC) reaches .08. Simply put, this study lends further proof 
that at .08, a person is too impaired to safely get behind the wheel. To 
help stem drunk driving and other safety hazards, the Department is 
releasing nearly $44 million in highway safety grants to 38 States and 
the District of Columbia. These grants will provide important incentives 
for States to save lives through tough programs and penalties to reduce 
drunk driving and increase seat belt use.
    But we must do more to make our streets and highways safer. In the 
Transportation Appropriations conference report, Congress has the 
opportunity right now to save an estimated 500 lives a year by setting a 
nationwide standard of .08 BAC. The Senate courageously passed this 
lifesaving measure in June, thanks to the leadership of Senators 
Lautenberg<Lautenberg, Frank R.> and Shelby.<Shelby, Richard 
C.> I urge the Congress to send me a final bill

that helps make .08 BAC the law of the land without further delay.
