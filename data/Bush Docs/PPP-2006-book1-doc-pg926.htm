Statement on the Death of Eusebio Penalver Mazorra<Penalver Mazorra, 
Eusebio<ls-thn-eq>
May 13, 2006

    Eusebio Penalver Mazorra was a Cuban patriot who spent 28 years in 
Castro's prisons. His resistance to tyranny is a testament to the moral 
courage of all Cubans who desire to see freedom return to their 
beautiful island nation. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in 
sending our thoughts and prayers to his family and friends.
