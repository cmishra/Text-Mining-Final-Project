Message to the Congress Transmitting the Notice on Continuation of Iran 
Emergency
November 1, 1993

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency is to continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 1993, to the Federal Register for 
publication. Similar notices have been sent annually to the Congress and 
the Federal Register since November 12, 1980. The most recent notice 
appeared in the Federal Register on October 28, 1992.
    The crisis between the United States and Iran that began in 1979 has 
not been fully resolved. The international tribunal established to 
adjudicate claims of the United States and U.S. nationals against the 
Iranian government and Iranian nationals against the United States 
continues to function, and normalization of commercial and diplomatic 
relations between the United States and Iran has not been achieved. In 
these circumstances, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain 
in force the broad authorities that are needed in the process of 
implementing the January 1981 agreements with Iran and in the eventual 
normalization of relations with that country.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
November 1, 1993.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
