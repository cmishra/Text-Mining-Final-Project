Remarks to Reporters at Fort Hood, Texas
April 8, 2007

Easter

    The President. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I just had the honor 
of celebrating Easter Sunday with members of our Armed Forces. I had a 
chance to reflect on the great sacrifice that our military and their 
families are making. I prayed for their safety, I prayed for their 
strength and comfort, and I prayed for peace.
    This is a joyous day for many people around the world, and it's a 
day for us to reflect on the many blessings in our lives. And we thank 
the General and the troops at Fort Hood for welcoming me and 
Laura,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and Mother<Bush, Barbara<ls-thn-eq> and 
Dad,<Bush, George H.W.<ls-thn-eq> and my mother-in-law.<Welch, 
Jenna<ls-thn-eq> We wish all Americans a peaceful weekend, and we wish 
our troops all the very best.
    Thank you.
    The First Lady.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> Happy Easter.

Note: The President spoke at 10 a.m. at the 13th Sustainment Command 
Chapel.
