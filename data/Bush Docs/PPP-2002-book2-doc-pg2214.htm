Statement on the Election of Senator Bill Frist<Frist, Bill<ls-thn-eq> 
to the Senate Majority Leader's Position
December 23, 2002

    I congratulate Senator Bill Frist on his election to Majority Leader 
of the U.S. Senate. Senator Frist has earned the trust and respect of 
his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I look forward to working 
with him and all Members of the Senate and House to advance our agenda 
for a safer, stronger, and better America.
