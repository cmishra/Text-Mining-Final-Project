Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Iran
March 11, 2008

To the Congress of the United States:
    The crisis between the United States and Iran constituted by the 
actions and policies of the Government of Iran that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on March 15, 1995, has not been 
resolved. The actions and policies of the Government of Iran are 
contrary to the interests of the United States in the region and pose a 
continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Iran remains the 
world's most active state sponsor of terrorism, and continues to provide 
lethal support to Lebanese Hizballah, HAMAS, Palestinian Islamic Jihad 
and numerous other terrorist organizations in the region, as well as to 
the Taliban in Afghanistan and various Iraqi militant groups. For these 
reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared with respect to Iran and maintain in force 
comprehensive sanctions against Iran to respond to this threat.
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the Iran emergency declared on March 15, 1995, is to continue in effect 
beyond March 15, 2008.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 March 11, 2008.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
March 12. The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
