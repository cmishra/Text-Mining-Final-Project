Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Burma
May 17, 2007

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal 
Register for publication, stating that the Burma emergency is to 
continue beyond May 20, 2007.
    The crisis between the United States and Burma arising from the 
actions and policies of the Government of Burma, including its policies 
of committing large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in 
Burma, that led to the declaration of a national emergency on May 20, 
1997, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to 
U.S. interests and pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this 
reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national 
emergency and maintain in force the sanctions against Burma to respond 
to this threat.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 May 17, 2007.

Note: The related notice of May 17 is listed in Appendix D at the end of 
this volume.
