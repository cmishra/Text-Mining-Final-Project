Letter to the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation
April 14, 1997

Dear Friends:
    Our nation will never forget that tragic day, almost two years ago, 
when we first learned of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal 
Building in Oklahoma City, and we will always remember the courage shown 
by the citizens of your strong and united city during that dark time. 
All Americans continue to support your recovery efforts, and our prayers 
are with you.
    With the destruction of the Murrah Federal Building, we learned once 
again that America is a family, and that such a brutal attack on any 
American is an attack on us all. In uniting around the citizens of 
Oklahoma City, our nation proved once again that no force of hatred or 
terrorism can ever defeat the American spirit.
    I want to express my support for your efforts to establish a 
memorial on the site of the bombing. This memorial will be a fitting 
tribute not only to those who died, but also to those whose lives were 
changed forever on April 19, 1995. I know that, by honoring our fellow 
Americans in this way, we can help to further the healing and restore 
hope for a brighter, more secure future.
    Hillary and I will always remember the time we spent with the 
families and survivors. Please know that we are keeping them, and all 
the people of Oklahoma City, in our thoughts and prayers.
        Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton
