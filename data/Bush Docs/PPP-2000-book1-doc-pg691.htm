Statement on Organ Donation Legislation
April 12, 2000

    I am pleased by Senator Frist<Frist, Bill<ls-thn-eq> and Senator 
Kennedy's<Kennedy, Edward M.<ls-thn-eq> announcement that they have 
reached a compromise on legislation that moves our Nation forward to 
promote greater equity and effectiveness in the allocation of our 
Nation's organ supply. This compromise takes a first step towards 
ensuring that those Americans most in need of receiving these life-
saving resources will be able to better access them. At the same time, 
we must redouble our efforts to encourage voluntary donation by all 
Americans.
