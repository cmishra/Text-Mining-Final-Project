Statement on German Ratification of the Maastricht Treaty
October 18, 1993

    With the completion of Germany's ratification process last week, the 
way has been cleared for the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty. 
The Maastricht Treaty marks a milestone in the progress of the European 
Community toward political and economic union, a goal which the United 
States strongly supports and encourages.
    On behalf of the American people, I offer congratulations to the 
Community on this occasion and reiterate our commitment to a strong and 
vibrant transatlantic partnership.
