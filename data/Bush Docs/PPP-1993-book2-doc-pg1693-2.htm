Statement by the Press Secretary on the President's Telephone 
Conversation With President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
October 5, 1993

    The President called President Yeltsin today from Air Force One to 
discuss the situation in Moscow. The two leaders spoke for 20 minutes. 
The President's purpose in calling was to express the continued, strong 
support of the United States for President Yeltsin and the Russian 
Government in the wake of the political crisis in Russia.
    President Yeltsin thanked the President for his support during the 
crisis and described the

events of the last few days. He reported that order had been restored to 
Moscow. In response to a question from the President, he also reaffirmed 
his intention to hold free and fair elections on December 12 and to 
proceed resolutely on political and economic reform in general.
    The two leaders pledged to work together to continue to build close 
relations between the United States and Russia. The President noted in 
this respect his intention to implement rapidly the $2.5 billion in 
economic assistance funds approved by the Congress last week for Russia 
and the other new states. The President added that the visits to Russia 
this autumn of several American Cabinet officers, including Secretary of 
State Christopher later this month, will help to move the relationship 
forward.
