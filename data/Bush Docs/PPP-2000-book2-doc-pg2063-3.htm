Statement on Congressional Action on a National Blood Alcohol Content 
Standard To Combat Drunk Driving
October 6, 2000

    I congratulate the Congress for passing landmark legislation today 
that will help save lives by keeping drunk drivers off the road. Earlier 
today the Congress overwhelmingly approved a bill that will help 
establish the first-ever national drunk driving standard at .08 blood 
alcohol content (BAC). This groundbreaking measure, which I have long 
advocated, will save hundreds of lives a year and represents a major 
victory for public safety and American families all across the country.
