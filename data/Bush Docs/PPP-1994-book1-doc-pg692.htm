Statement on the Bombing in Hadera, Israel
April 13, 1994

    The United States strongly condemns this terrorist act. On behalf of 
the American people, I want to express my condolences to the families of 
the innocent victims killed on Israel's day of remembrance for those who 
fell in war. This action, like those before it, is a further attempt by 
extremists to derail the peace process. They must not be allowed to 
succeed.
    We strongly support Prime Minister Rabin's pledge that he will 
continue the peace negotiations regardless of such terrorist acts. We 
also welcome Chairman Arafat's rejection of attacks on innocent Israeli 
civilians intended to strike at the peace process. We believe the best 
response to the enemies of peace is to demonstrate that negotiations can 
change realities on the ground and give hope to Israelis and 
Palestinians for a peaceful future.
