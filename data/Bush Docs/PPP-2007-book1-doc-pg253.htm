Remarks Following a Meeting With Cochairs of the President's Commission 
on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors
March 7, 2007

    I am concerned that our soldiers and their families are not getting 
the treatment that they deserve, having volunteered to defend our 
country. Any report of medical neglect will be taken seriously by this 
administration, and I'm confident by the Congress, and we will address 
problems quickly.
    I've asked two of America's fine public servants, Senator Dole<Dole, 
Robert J.<ls-thn-eq> and Secretary Shalala,<Shalala, Donna E.<ls-thn-eq> 
to chair a Commission that will analyze our health care both at the 
Defense Department and at the Veterans Department, to ensure that not 
only our soldiers but their families have got complete confidence in the 
Government's upholding its responsibility to treat those who have been 
wounded.
    I am concerned that there may be flaws in the system between when a 
soldier is on the battlefield, through the Defense Department, through 
the Veterans Administration, and finally to the community. I can't think 
of two better people to analyze the situation and to make 
recommendations--two people to lead a Commission of probably nine 
people--and that would be Senator Dole,<Dole, Robert J.<ls-thn-eq> who 
is himself a veteran, and a wounded veteran at that, a former 
distinguished Senator, a man who knows Washington well. But more 
importantly, he knows the kind of questions to ask. And Secretary 
Shalala,<Shalala, Donna E.<ls-thn-eq> who is an expert on health. She 
lived after 8 years in President Clinton's<Clinton, William 
J.<ls-thn-eq> administration; she knows what to look for; she knows the 
questions to ask.
    And I'm confident that this Commission will bring forth the truth. 
And as I assured the<Dole, Robert J.<ls-thn-eq> Chairmen,<Shalala, Donna 
E.<ls-thn-eq> I am confident that there will be a quick response to any 
problems that you may find. So I can't thank you enough for taking time 
and to serve your nation once again. God bless. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:12 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to former Sen. Robert J. Dole; and 
former Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E. Shalala.
