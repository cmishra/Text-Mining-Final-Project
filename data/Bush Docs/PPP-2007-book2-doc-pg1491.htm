Statement on the Annapolis Conference
November 25, 2007

    I am pleased to welcome Prime Minister Olmert,<Olmert, 
Ehud<ls-thn-eq> President Abbas,<Abbas, Mahmoud<ls-thn-eq> and 
representatives of more than 40 countries to the United States for the 
November 27 Annapolis Conference. The broad attendance at this 
conference by regional states and other key international participants 
demonstrates the international resolve to seize this important 
opportunity to advance freedom and peace in the Middle East.
    This conference will signal international support for the Israelis' 
and Palestinians' intention to commence negotiations on the 
establishment of a Palestinian state and the realization of peace 
between these two peoples.
    It will also provide an opportunity for the Israelis, the 
Palestinians, and their neighbors to recommit to implementing the 
roadmap, with the U.S. monitoring their progress by the parties' 
agreement.
    Finally, the conference will review Palestinian plans to build the 
institutions of a democratic state and their preparations for next 
month's donors' conference in Paris.
    I remain personally committed to implementing my vision of two 
democratic states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace 
and security.
    The Israelis and Palestinians have waited a long time for this 
vision to be realized, and I call upon all those gathering in Annapolis 
this week to redouble their efforts to turn dreams of peace into 
reality. I look forward to my discussions with Prime Minister 
Olmert<Olmert, Ehud<ls-thn-eq> and President Abbas<Abbas, 
Mahmoud<ls-thn-eq> this week, as well as to addressing the conference 
along with them on Tuesday.
