 Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Implementation 
of the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption
 May 7, 2002

 Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
     Pursuant to the resolution of advice and consent to ratification of 
the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption adopted by the Senate 
on July 27, 2000, the President must submit to the Speaker of the House 
of Representatives and the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations an annual implementation report each year for a 5-year period, 
beginning after the initial report was filed in April 2001.
     This second report to the Congress, prepared by my Administration, 
indicates that 28 of the 34 members of the Organization

of American States have signed the Convention (Barbados and Belize 
signed in the past year), and 25 members deposited their instruments of 
ratification with the Organization of American States.
     Since the last report, the realization that corruption threatens 
political and economic stability, undermines democracy, and can create 
conditions ripe for terrorism has focused governments on the need to 
actively combat this international scourge. The Inter-American 
Convention contributes to this fight in the Americas and serves as a 
model to other regions. With the development of an effective evaluation 
mechanism, the Convention will help establish a new level of 
transparency and accountability. This report also outlines the steps 
taken to establish an evaluation mechanism, known as the Committee of 
Experts, to oversee implementation of the Convention.
     I look forward to working with you to ensure that we continue to 
combat corruption in our hemisphere and across the globe.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

  Note:  Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of 
the House of Representatives, and Joseph R. Biden, Jr., chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office 
of the Press Secretary on May 8.
