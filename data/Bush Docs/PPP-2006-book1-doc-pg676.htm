Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments
April 6, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 Budget 
amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, and State and Other 
International Programs; the Federal Communications Commission; and the 
Smithsonian Institution. Overall, the discretionary budget authority in 
my FY 2007 Budget would not be increased by these requests.
    This transmittal also contains FY 2007 Budget amendments for the 
legislative branch. As a matter of comity, appropriations requests for 
the legislative branch are commonly transmitted without change.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
