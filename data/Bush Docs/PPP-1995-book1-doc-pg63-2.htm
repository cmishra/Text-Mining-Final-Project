Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Plan for Consolidation of 
International Broadcasting
January 19, 1995

Dear Mr. Chairman:
    Pursuant to the requirements of section 310(a)(2)(B) of the United 
States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (title III, Public Law 
103-236), I am pleased to transmit a Plan for the Consolidation of 
United States Government International Broadcasting.
    The Plan reflects my continued strong commitment to the use of 
international radio and television as methods for advancing democracy 
and enlarging the community of free-market nations.
    I look forward to working with the Congress on this and other issues 
in the months ahead.

Note: Identical letters were sent to Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations; Mark O. Hatfield, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Appropriations; Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman, House 
Committee on International Relations; and Bob Livingston, chairman,
