Appointment for the Board of Governors of the American Red Cross
October 20, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to appoint seven 
administration officials to be Government members of the Board of 
Governors of the American Red Cross. The seven are:

    Secretary of Defense Les Aspin
    Export-Import Bank Chairman Kenneth Brody
    Secretary of State Warren Christopher
    Secretary of Education Richard Riley
    Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala
    Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt
    Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

    ``I have long admired and sought to support the ongoing work of the 
American Red Cross to bring aid to those in need both around the world 
and here in our own communities,'' said the President. ``As I recently 
saw firsthand during the Midwest flooding this summer, their workers and 
volunteers are true lifesavers. I am appointing this senior group of 
officials to serve on their board because I want to be sure that my 
administration does everything that we can to support the Red Cross' 
important work.''
