Statement on the United States District Court Decision on the 
Child Support Recovery Act
August 28, 1995

    On July 26, 1995, the United States District Court for the District 
of Arizona struck down the Child Support Recovery Act as an 
unconstitutional exercise of congressional power. I respectfully 
disagree with this decision. I asked the Justice Department to review 
this case, and the Department has filed a motion asking the court to 
reconsider its decision.
    The Child Support Recovery Act gives us the power to punish deadbeat 
parents who cross State lines to avoid paying child support. It is 
essential for Federal law enforcement to have this authority because the 
States cannot bring these criminals to justice, especially the hardcore 
group of parents who flagrantly move from State to State to evade their 
obligations.

    A child should be able to expect the most basic support from those 
who chose to bring that child into the world. Parental responsibility 
does not end at the State line. The taxpayers of America should be able 
to expect that the burden of caring for these children will be placed on 
the shoulders of the parents, where it rightfully belongs.
