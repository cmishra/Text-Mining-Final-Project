Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process Initiative by Prime 
Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom
May 16, 1997

    I welcome Prime Minister Blair's statement today on Northern Ireland 
as a balanced and constructive step toward restoring momentum to the 
peace process. His words offer hope and reassurance to the people of 
both of Northern Ireland's traditions.
    The Prime Minister has made clear that this British Government, like 
its predecessor, wants to see inclusive talks, but it will invite Sinn 
Fein to the negotiating table only on the basis of an unequivocal cease-
fire. And he has taken the initiative in offering to meet with Sinn 
Fein, at the official level, to assess whether inclusive talks are 
possible on that basis. I urge Sinn Fein to take up this offer, and I 
pray it will bring about an end to the violence for good. Now is the 
time to open a new chapter in the history of this tragic conflict and 
achieve through dialog and negotiation the lasting settlement the people 
of Northern Ireland want and deserve.
