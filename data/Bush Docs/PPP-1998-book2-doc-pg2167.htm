Statement on the Death of Morris K. Udall
December 13, 1998

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Representative 
Morris Udall. Mo Udall was a leader whose uncommon wisdom, wit, and 
dedication won the love of his colleagues and the respect of all 
Americans. It was my pleasure to award him the Medal of Freedom, the 
highest civilian award a President can bestow.
    Mo Udall represented the people of Arizona for more than three 
decades and guided the Nation forward on issues ranging from the reform 
of our election laws to improving the Postal Service. As a Presidential 
candidate and a leader of our party, his was an articulate voice 
reminding us of what our Nation can achieve when we leave no one behind. 
Above all, he was a devoted steward of the land that God gave us and was 
responsible for the preservation of some of our most important 
wilderness areas. It is fitting that the easternmost point of the United 
States, in the Virgin Islands, and the westernmost point, in Guam, are 
both named ``Udall Point.'' The Sun will never set on the legacy of Mo 
Udall.
    Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Norma, their six 
children and many grandchildren, and the people of Arizona.
