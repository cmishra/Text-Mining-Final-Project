Remarks on Counterterrorism Initiatives and an Exchange With Reporters
April 26, 1995

    The President. I asked the leaders of Congress from both parties to 
come to the White House today because I know that we have a shared 
commitment to do everything we possibly can to stamp out the kind of 
vicious behavior we saw in Oklahoma City. Everyone here is determined to 
do that, and I want us to work together to get the job done.
    On Sunday, I announced the first series of steps we must take to 
combat terrorism in America. Today I'm announcing further measures, 
grounded in common sense and steeled with force. These measures will 
strengthen law enforcement and sharpen their ability to crack down on 
terrorists wherever they're from, be it at home or abroad. This will arm 
them with investigative tools, increased enforcement, and tougher 
penalties.
    I say, again: Justice in this case must be swift, certain, and 
severe. And for anyone who dares to sow terror on American land, justice 
must be swift, certain, and severe. We must move

on with law enforcement measures quickly. We must move so that we can 
prevent this kind of thing from happening again. We cannot allow our 
entire country to be subjected to the horror that the people of Oklahoma 
City endured. We can prevent it and must do everything we can to prevent 
it. I know that we would do this together without regard to party, and 
I'm looking forward to this discussion of it.
    Q. Civil libertarians are worried there may be some ability by law 
enforcement agencies to abuse the power that you may be given.
    The President. I think we can strike the right balance. We've got to 
do more to protect the American people.

Note: The President spoke at 5:09 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House, prior to a meeting with congressional leaders. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of these remarks.
