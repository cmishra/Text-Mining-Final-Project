Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments for the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding 
Office
September 20, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2007 Budget 
amendments for the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding Office 
in the Department of Homeland Security. The total discretionary budget 
authority in my FY 2007 Budget would not be increased by this request.
    The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
