Statement on House of Representatives Action on Education Reform 
Legislation
May 23, 2001

    I commend the House of Representatives for taking a giant step 
toward improving America's public schools. The education reforms adopted 
today build on the principles of accountability, flexibility, local 
control, and greater choices for parents. The reforms require annual 
testing of students in grades three through eight, give States 
unprecedented flexibility to meet critical education needs and, for the 
first time, tie Federal education funding to results. These education 
reforms also give parents real options to get their children out of 
persistently failing schools through public school choice with 
transportation provided, and supplemental services such as tutoring and 
summer school. I look forward to working with Members of the House and 
Senate to make sure this vital legislation becomes law so that no child 
in America is left behind.
