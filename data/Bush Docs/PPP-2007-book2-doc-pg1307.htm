Statement on Representative Ralph S. Regula's<Regula, Ralph 
Straus<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not To Seek Reelection
October 12, 2007

    Ralph Regula is a distinguished public servant who has dedicated his 
life to helping the citizens of Ohio's 16th Congressional District and 
our Nation. As a sailor, teacher, and legislator, he has worked 
tirelessly to make America stronger.
    While serving for over three decades in Congress, Ralph has returned 
weekly to his family farm and never lost sight of the issues that matter 
most to the people of Ohio. He has long had a commitment to creating 
jobs, strengthening schools, supporting small businesses, and protecting 
Ohio's natural treasures. As the longest continuously serving U.S. 
Representative in his State's history, Ralph will retire with the 
respect of his peers and the appreciation of his constituents.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are grateful for his service and 
appreciate his friendship. We wish Ralph, Mary,<Regula, Mary<ls-thn-eq> 
and the entire Regula family all the best.
