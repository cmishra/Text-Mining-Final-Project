Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Blueprint for Immediate 
Assistance To Help Medicare Beneficiaries Buy Prescription Drugs
January 29, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Enclosed please find the blueprint for my program to provide 
immediate assistance to help certain Medicare beneficiaries buy 
prescription drugs. I look forward to working with the Congress to enact 
these principles into law and to working together on comprehensive 
Medicare reform.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
