Statement on Grants to Projects Aiding the Homeless
December 29, 1994

    It is imperative that we not turn our backs on the Nation's 
homeless. The number of homeless families and young people suffering 
from abuse and neglect continues to rise. It is my hope that these 
grants will help those who need our help the most. I am also pleased 
that AmeriCorps members will be engaged in the struggle to end 
homelessness. This is an example of national service at its best.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the award of grants to projects aiding the homeless.
