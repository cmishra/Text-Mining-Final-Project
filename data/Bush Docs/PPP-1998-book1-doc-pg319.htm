Statement on Senate Support for NATO Enlargement
March 3, 1998

    I welcome today's strong endorsement by the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee for admitting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO. 
By adding these countries as our newest allies, we will make NATO 
stronger, Europe more stable, and America more secure.
    The United States has led the way in building an undivided, 
democratic, peaceful Europe. I hope we will be among the first to ratify 
NATO's historic enlargement. I look forward to the full Senate vote on 
this issue in the weeks ahead.
