Statement on National Youth Service Day
April 14, 2000

    This weekend, as we celebrate the 12th annual National Youth Service 
Day, I want to recognize the millions of young Americans across the 
country who give to their communities day-in and day-out. They are 
rebuilding our Nation's schools and neighborhoods and sparking a new 
spirit of civic engagement. And they know that service is not the work 
of just a single day; it is the work of a lifetime.
    In recent months we've had too many tragic reminders that young 
people pay the price when bonds of community and responsibility become 
frayed. But we should also remember that our children are our greatest 
resource and that, if we are to build a stronger, safer Nation, we 
should begin by empowering young people to make a difference. That's why 
I am so proud of the young citizens who have served in AmeriCorps. And 
that's why I am so proud of the many contributions that so many of our 
youth are making on this special day. Through the leadership of young 
Americans, all of us--whatever our age--can help keep alive our sense of 
opportunity, responsibility, and community.
