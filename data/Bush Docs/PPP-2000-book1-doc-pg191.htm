Statement on the Death of Carl B. Albert<Albert, Carl B.<ls-thn-eq>
February 5, 2000

    Hillary and I were saddened today to learn of the death of Carl 
Albert. Carl served his country in Congress through three decades, as 
majority whip, majority leader, and ultimately, Speaker of the House.
    Working with President Johnson, he played an invaluable role 
crafting the greatest effort America had ever launched against poverty. 
And as the 46th Speaker, he led the House during a trying time in our 
Nation's history. Through it all, he kept his gaze focused on the 
national interest. Carl Albert was a true statesman. Our prayers go out 
to family and friends.
