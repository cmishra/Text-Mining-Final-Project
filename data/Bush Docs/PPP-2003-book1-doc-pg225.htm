Statement on Proposed Jobs-and-Growth Tax Relief Legislation
February 27, 2003

    I commend Senators Nickles<Nickles, Don> and 
Miller<Miller, Zell> and Chairman Thomas<Thomas, 
Craig> for their leadership in introducing my jobs-and-growth 
package, which will put money back into the hands of millions of 
Americans and increase investment and job opportunities.
    Today's action demonstrates bipartisan commitment to promoting 
economic growth and creating jobs. The plan will cut taxes for everyone 
across the board, eliminate the unfair double taxation of dividends, 
increase small-business investment incentives, help families with 
children, and end the penalty paid by working couples.
    I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Thomas,<Thomas, 
Craig> Chairman Grassley,<Grassley, Charles E.> and 
members of both parties who share my vision for strengthening America's 
economic recovery and ensuring that every individual who wants a job is 
able to find one.
