Statement on House of Representatives Action on Appropriations 
Legislation
May 24, 2002

    The House did a great service today for our men and women in uniform 
fighting the war against terror, for homeland security, and for fiscal 
discipline. The House also showed our enemies that America is united and 
determined to fight and win this war on our terms.
    A combination of recession and the need to spend what it takes to 
win the war have put the Federal budget into deficit. As we do what is 
necessary to prevail in the war and protect our homeland, the Congress 
must restrain other Government spending so we can return to a balanced 
budget soon.
    The House has shown that a responsible budget can be enacted, and 
the Senate should follow suit. I expect the Senate to only spend on what 
is necessary to fight the war and for our immediate emergency needs. 
With our Nation now at war, now is not the time for unnecessary spending 
on lower priority items.
    The House bill is a successful model for budget and spending bills: 
Fund our most basic priorities without increasing the deficit or 
undermining our efforts to return to a balanced budget. I am especially 
grateful to Speaker Hastert<Hastert, J. Dennis> and Chairman 
Young<Young, C.W. ``Bill''> for their leadership, and to all 
the Members of Congress who voted for this package.
