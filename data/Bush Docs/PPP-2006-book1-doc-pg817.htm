Remarks During a Visit to the Hands On Gulf Coast Civic Action Center in 
Biloxi, Mississippi
April 27, 2006

    The President. I've come to the conclusion that I'm at a terrific 
place, where people are here bound by a common desire to show compassion 
to their neighbors in need. I really thank you. It's a compassion 
commune--[laughter]--where people are united by a singular purpose and 
setting a great example. Everybody--most people I talk to say, ``Well, 
it makes me feel better.'' The truth of the matter is, when you 
volunteer to serve somebody in need, it does make you feel better.
    So for all those in our country who are wondering whether or not 
they can make a difference in somebody's life, the answer is, all you 
have to do is look at these people here.
    Audience member. Volunteer!
    The President. All right. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 3:17 p.m.
