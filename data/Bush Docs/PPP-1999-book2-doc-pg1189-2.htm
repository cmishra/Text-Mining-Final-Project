Message to the Congress Transmitting the District of Columbia Budget 
Request
July 12, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 202(c) of the District of Columbia 
Financial Management and Responsibility Assistance Act of 1995 and 
section 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization 
Act, as amended, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal 
Year 2000 Budget Request Act.
    This proposed Fiscal Year 2000 Budget represents the major 
programmatic objectives of the Mayor, the Council of the District of 
Columbia, and the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and 
Management Assistance Authority. For Fiscal Year 2000, the District 
estimates revenue of $5.482 billion and total expenditures of $5.482 
billion, resulting in a budget surplus of $47,000.
    My transmittal of the District of Columbia's budget, as required by 
law, does not represent an endorsement of its contents.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 12, 1999.
