Remarks at the Children's Holiday Reception
December 3, 2007

    Thank you all for coming. Welcome to the White House. I've got two 
jobs. One is to introduce you to my wife Laura,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
and two is to tell you how much we admire your moms and dads, how much 
we appreciate their service to our country.
    I know it's hard when you have a loved one, somebody you love a lot, 
not going to be around for the Christmas season. And one way we hope to 
help you through the moment is to invite you here to the White House for 
what's going to be a pretty special moment.
    So I want to say thank you. When you talk to your mom or dad or e-
mail your mom or dad, you make sure you tell them that President and 
Mrs. Bush<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> are sure proud of their contributions 
to our country.
    And so with that, I'm going to do my second job, which is to bring 
to the podium here my wife,<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> First Lady Laura 
Bush.

Note: The President spoke at 10:30 a.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also 
included the remarks of the First Lady.
