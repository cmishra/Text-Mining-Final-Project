Nomination for an Assistant to the Secretary of Defense
April 9, 1993

    The President will nominate Harold Palmer Smith to be Assistant to 
the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy. Mr. Smith, a trained nuclear 
engineer, has advised the Defense Department in a variety of capacities 
since the late 1960's.
    ``Through his long career of public and private sector service, 
Harold Palmer Smith has distinguished himself with sound scientific 
advice,'' said the President. ``I am glad to have him joining Secretary 
Aspin at the Pentagon.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
