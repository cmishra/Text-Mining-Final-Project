Statement on Signing the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006
November 22, 2005

    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 2862, the ``Science, State, 
Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006.'' The 
Act funds the Departments of Justice, Commerce, and State, and several 
independent agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Small 
Business Administration, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

[[Page 1762]]

    The executive branch shall construe as advisory the provisions of 
the Act that purport to direct or burden the Executive's conduct of 
foreign relations, including the authority to recognize foreign states 
and negotiate international agreements on behalf of the United States, 
or limit the President's authority as Commander in Chief. These 
provisions include sections 405, 413, 414, 631, 637, and language under 
the headings ``International Trade Administration, Operations and 
Administration'' and ``Contributions for International Peacekeeping 
Activities.''
