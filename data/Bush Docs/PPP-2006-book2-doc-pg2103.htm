Statement on the Death of Glenn E. ``Bo'' Schembechler<Schembechler, 
Glenn E. ``Bo''<ls-thn-eq>
November 18, 2006

    Bo Schembechler was a true legend of college football. I was 
saddened to learn of his death. He inspired generations of players and 
fans by insisting that his teams play hard, play fair, and bring honor 
to themselves and their school by finishing their educations and 
contributing to society. He was an extraordinary leader and role model 
who will be missed. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I join fans of the 
Big Blue in extending our sympathies to his wife, Cathy<Schembechler, 
Cathy<ls-thn-eq>, and his family and friends.
