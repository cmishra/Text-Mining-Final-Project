Statement on Assistance to California
June 7, 1994

    Californians have been working extraordinarily hard to get their 
homes, their businesses, and their lives back to normal. This is 
creating unexpected and unprecedented need for assistance from the 
Federal Government. This recommendation should assure the people of 
southern California that our commitment to help them get back on their 
feet remains strong and unwavering.

Note: The statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary 
on the President's request to Congress for additional funds to assist 
the State of California in the wake of the earthquake earlier this year.
