Statement on Afghanistan's Adoption of a New Constitution
January 4, 2004

    I congratulate the people of Afghanistan on the adoption of their 
new constitution. This document lays the foundation for democratic 
institutions and provides a framework for national elections in 2004. A 
democratic Afghanistan will serve the interests and just aspirations of 
all of the Afghan people and help ensure that terror finds no further 
refuge in that proud land. This new constitution marks a historic step 
forward, and we will continue to assist the Afghan people as they build 
a free and prosperous future.
