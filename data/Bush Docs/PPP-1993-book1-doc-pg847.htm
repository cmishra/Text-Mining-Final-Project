Statement on the Death of Donald Slayton
June 14, 1993

    I was deeply saddened to hear last night of the death of astronaut 
Deke Slayton, a pioneer in space exploration who helped chart the course 
for America's pursuit of the New Frontier.
    Throughout his career, Deke met adversity with determination, and 
discouragement with a dedication to never yield his dreams. His 
commitment to space exploration helped pull the world into an era of new 
possibilities that grows and expands to this day.
    Both Hillary and I extend our heartfelt sympathies to Deke Slayton's 
family and former colleagues. We mourn his passing, but we celebrate 
what he stood for and what he accomplished for America.
