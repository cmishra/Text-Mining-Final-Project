Statement on the Proliferation Security Initiative
May 31, 2005

    Since the Proliferation Security Initiative was launched in Krakow, 
Poland, 2 years ago, nations around the world have been cooperating to 
develop new and dynamic approaches to stop the global trafficking of 
weapons of mass destruction. To counter proliferation networks, we are 
working in common cause with like-minded states prepared to make maximum 
use of their laws and capabilities to deny rogue states, terrorists, and 
black marketeers access to WMD-related materials and delivery means.

    Today, more than 60 countries are supporters of the PSI. Its global 
reach continues to expand, most recently by endorsements from Argentina, 
Georgia, and Iraq. The goals of PSI have been endorsed by the United 
Nations Security Council in Resolution 1540.
    Through training exercises involving military, law enforcement, 
customs, intelligence, and legal experts, many PSI partners are 
developing new tools to improve their national and collective capacities 
to interdict WMD and related shipments--whether on land, at sea, or in 
the air.
    On this foundation, PSI partners are building a record of success by 
stopping the transshipment of WMD-related materials, prosecuting 
proliferation networks, and shutting down front companies trafficking in 
WMD materials.
    I urge all responsible states to join this global campaign by 
endorsing the PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles and by committing 
to work to end the security threat posed by the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction.
