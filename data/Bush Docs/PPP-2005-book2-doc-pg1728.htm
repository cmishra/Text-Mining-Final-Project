Message to the Congress Transmitting Proposed Legislation To Implement 
the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement
November 16, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:
    I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents to 
implement the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (the 
``Agreement''). This Agreement enhances our bilateral relationship with 
a strategic friend and ally in the Middle East region and will promote 
economic growth and prosperity in both nations.
    In negotiating this Agreement, my Administration was guided by the 
objectives set out in the Trade Act of 2002. The Agreement reflects my 
Administration's commitment to opening markets and expanding 
opportunities for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. 
The Agreement will open Bahrain's market for U.S. manufactured goods, 
agricultural products, and services. As soon as it enters into force, 
the Agreement will eliminate tariffs on all manufactured goods that the 
United States sells to Bahrain and immediately remove Bahrain's import 
duties on over 80 percent of U.S. agricultural products. The Agreement 
is also one of the most comprehensive ever negotiated to reduce barriers 
to trade in services and will create new opportunities for U.S. services 
firms.
    The Agreement contains procedures that will facilitate cooperation 
between the United States and Bahrain on environmental and labor 
matters. The labor chapter of the Agreement reinforces Bahrain's recent 
legislative actions to expand democracy and improve the protection of 
worker rights, including trade union rights. Provisions in the Agreement 
requiring effective enforcement of environmental laws will contribute to 
high levels of environmental protection.
    The approval of this Agreement will be another significant step 
towards creating a Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013. This Agreement 
offers the United States yet another opportunity to encourage economic 
reform in a moderate Muslim nation as we have done through our free 
trade agreements with Jordan and Morocco. Leaders in Bahrain are 
supporting the pursuit of social and economic reforms in the region, 
encouraging foreign investment connected to broad-based development, and 
providing

better protection for women and workers. It is strongly in our national 
interest to embrace and encourage these reforms, and passing this 
legislation is a crucial step toward that end.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 November 16, 2005.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
November 17.
