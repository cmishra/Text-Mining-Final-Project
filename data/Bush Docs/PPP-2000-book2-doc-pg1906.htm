Statement on the President's Commission on Improving Economic 
Opportunity in Communities Dependent on Tobacco Production While 
Protecting Public Health
September 22, 2000

    Today I am pleased to sign an Executive order establishing a new 
Commission to improve opportunities for tobacco farmers and their 
communities while continuing to protect public health. This action 
builds on the longstanding commitment Vice President Gore and I share to 
protect our children from the dangers of tobacco use and protect 
individual tobacco farmers. Tobacco growers, like many other farmers, 
have confronted difficult economic circumstances these last few years as 
tobacco companies increasingly turn to foreign tobacco. We have 
supported several efforts over the years to protect tobacco farmers and 
to develop new opportunities for these growers and their communities. 
The Commission, which will make recommendations on ways to continue this 
work while protecting public health, is an important next step.
    This new panel, the President's Commission on Improving Economic 
Opportunity in Communities Dependent on Tobacco Production While 
Protecting Public Health, will be cochaired by William Martin ``Rod'' 
Kuegel, Jr.,<Kuegel, William Martin (Rod), Jr.> the president 
of the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, and Matthew 
Myers,<Myers, Matthew> the president of the Campaign for 
Tobacco-Free Kids. Both are leaders in their communities with proven 
records on bringing grower and health groups together on issues 
important to both. In 1998 they worked with a coalition of grower, 
public health, and religious groups to issue a statement of principles 
outlining their shared commitment to reducing disease caused by tobacco 
products and ensuring the future prosperity and stability of American 
tobacco farmers and farming communities. The work of this important new 
Commission will serve to further demonstrate that the goals of reducing 
youth smoking and protecting American farmers can be pursued together.

Note: The Executive order is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
