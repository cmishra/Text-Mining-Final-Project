Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Sudan
October 27, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the Sudanese emergency is to continue in effect beyond November 3, 1998.
    The crisis between the United States and Sudan that led to the 
declaration on November 3, 1997, of a national emergency has not been 
resolved. The Government of Sudan continues to support international 
terrorism and engage in human rights violations, including the denial of 
religious freedom. Such Sudanese actions pose a continuing unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary 
to maintain in force the broad authorities necessary to apply economic 
pressure on the Government of Sudan.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on October 28. 
The notice of October 27 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
