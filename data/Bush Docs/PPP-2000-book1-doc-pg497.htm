Statement on the Observance of Nowruz
March 20, 2000

    This week people of Iranian heritage around the world will celebrate 
Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Nowruz is a tradition as old as the land 
of Persia, but at the same time it celebrates change and renewal: the 
changing season from winter to spring, a new year and a new beginning. 
It is a time to gather with family and friends and to look toward the 
future. I extend my best wishes for the new year to Americans of Iranian 
origin and to the people of Iran. I hope this season will bring the 
start of a new era of better relations between our two countries.
    Nowruz Mubarak.
