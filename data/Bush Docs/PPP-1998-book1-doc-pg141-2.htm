Message to the Senate Transmitting the Trademark Law Treaty With 
Documentation
January 29, 1998

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for advice and consent to ratification, the 
Trademark Law Treaty done at Geneva October 27, 1994, with Regulations. 
The Treaty was signed by the United States on October 28, 1994. I also 
transmit for the information of the Senate, the report of the Department 
of State with respect to the Treaty,

accompanied by a detailed analysis of the Treaty and Regulations, 
prepared by the Department of State and the Patent and Trademark Office 
of the Department of Commerce.
    Ratification of the Treaty is in the best interests of the United 
States. The Treaty eliminates many of the burdensome formal requirements 
that now exist in the trademark application and registration maintenance 
processes of many countries. Those requirements cause considerable 
expense and delay for trademark owners. The Treaty is aimed at 
standardizing and simplifying the application process so that the 
application will be accepted and processed by the trademark offices of 
all parties to the Treaty.
    I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable 
consideration to the Trademark Law Treaty with Regulations and give its 
advice and consent to the ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

January 29, 1998.
