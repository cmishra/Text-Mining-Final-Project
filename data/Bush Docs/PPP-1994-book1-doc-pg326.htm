Statement on the Church Bombing in Lebanon
February 27, 1994

    The killing of people at prayer is an outrage against faith and 
humanity. On behalf of the American people, I condemn in the strongest 
possible terms this latest incident in which innocent Lebanese at 
communion on Sunday morning were killed by bombs planted in a church. I 
extend my deepest sympathy to the bereaved.
    Just as Friday's massacre in a Hebron mosque was aimed at the peace 
process, this bomb attack seems clearly aimed at Lebanon's 
reconciliation process. The extremists have a common purpose, to promote 
division, strife, and war. They must and will not be allowed to succeed.
    I call on men and women of all faiths to unite in opposition to the 
forces of dark hatred. The people of the Middle East deserve a peaceful 
future. They deserve the right to pray in peace, as we join them in 
praying for it.
