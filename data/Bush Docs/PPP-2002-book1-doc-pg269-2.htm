Remarks in Beijing on Confirmation of the Death of Daniel Pearl<Pearl, 
Daniel>
February 22, 2002

    Laura and I and the American people are deeply saddened to learn 
about the loss of Daniel Pearl's life. And we're really sad for his 
wife<Pearl, Mariane> and his parents and his friends and 
colleagues, who have been clinging to hope for weeks that he be found 
alive. We are especially sad for his unborn child, who will now know his 
father only through the memory of others.
    All Americans are sad and angry to learn of the murder. All around 
the world, American journalists and humanitarian aid workers and 
diplomats and others do important

work in places that are sometimes dangerous. Those who would threaten 
Americans, those who would engage in criminal, barbaric acts, need to 
know that these crimes only hurt their cause and only deepen the resolve 
of the United States of America to rid to world of these agents of 
terror.
    May God bless Daniel Pearl.

Note: The President spoke at 7:21 a.m. at the St. Regis Hotel. In his 
remarks, he referred to Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl, who 
was kidnaped January 23 in Karachi, Pakistan; and his wife, Mariane.
