Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Libya
January 2, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect

beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent the enclosed notice, stating that the Libyan emergency is to 
continue in effect beyond January 7, 1998, to the Federal Register for 
publication.
    The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been 
resolved. The Government of Libya has continued its actions and policies 
in support of terrorism, despite the calls by the United Nations 
Security Council, in Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993), 
that it demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of terrorism. 
Such Libyan actions and policies pose a continuing unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign policy 
interests of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined 
that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities 
necessary to apply economic pressure to the Government of Libya to 
reduce its ability to support international terrorism.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on January 5. 
The notice of January 2 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
