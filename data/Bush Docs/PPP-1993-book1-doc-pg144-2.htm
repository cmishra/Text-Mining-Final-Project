Nomination for Deputy Secretary of Labor
February 19, 1993

    The President announced today his intention to nominate Thomas Glynn 
of Belmont, Massachusetts for the post of Deputy Secretary of Labor. 
Glynn is currently Brown University's senior vice president for finance 
and administration.
    ``One of the most important things we need to do in this 
administration is learn how to manage the Government better,'' said 
President Clinton. ``I've pledged to save $9 billion by controlling 
administrative costs. Thomas Glynn has the kind of experience managing 
large institutions, both public and private, that is needed to make that 
happen.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
