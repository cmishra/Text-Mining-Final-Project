Message to the Senate Transmitting the Zimbabwe-United States 
Extradition Treaty With Documentation
January 28, 1998

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Republic of Zimbabwe, signed at Harare on July 25, 1997.
    In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
    This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between 
the law enforcement communities of both countries, and thereby make a 
significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. It is 
the first extradition treaty between the two countries.

    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

January 28, 1998.
