Statement on Announcement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina National Day
September 1, 1999

    Today the Joint Presidents of Bosnia-Herzegovina announced that the 
national day of their country will henceforth be celebrated on November 
21, the anniversary of the Dayton peace accords of 1995. In so doing, 
the leaders of every ethnic community in Bosnia-Herzegovina have made 
clear that Dayton marked not merely the end of a war but the beginning 
of a new country and a blueprint for its future. I am pleased that the 
date November 21 will be honored as a symbol of multi-ethnic democracy 
and solidarity between the people of the United States and the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
