Statement on Ordering Reserves to Active Duty To Support Military Action 
in Kosovo
April 27, 1999

    Today I authorized the Secretaries of Defense and Transportation to 
order to active duty up to 33,102 essential members of our Reserve 
component to support NATO and U.S. operations related to the conflict in 
Kosovo.
    The Secretary of Defense<Cohen, William S.> has informed 
me that he intends to exercise that authority immediately to recall 
approximately 2,000 essential Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard 
crews from eight States. These reservists will support refueling 
operations for our intensifying air operations in Kosovo. I expect that 
over the coming days and weeks, Secretary Cohen and General 
Shelton<Shelton, Henry H.> will call upon additional personnel 
from all branches of the service to fill critical support positions in 
our humanitarian and combat operations in and around the former 
Yugoslavia. These Reserves are essential to America's military strength; 
they are part of the total force we bring to bear whenever our men and 
women in uniform are called to action.
    All Americans are proud of the commitment these citizen soldiers 
make to their country. On behalf of all Americans, I thank each 
reservist, their families and loved ones, and their employers here at 
home for their service and sacrifice in support of our important mission 
in Kosovo.

Note: The Executive order on ordering Reserves to active duty is listed 
in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
