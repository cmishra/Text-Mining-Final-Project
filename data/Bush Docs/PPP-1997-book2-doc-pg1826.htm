Statement on the Health Care Task Force Civil Case
December 29, 1997

    While the Department of Justice is still reviewing whether to appeal 
Judge Lamberth's<Lamberth, Royce C.<ls-thn-eq> ruling, I am quite 
confident that Mr. Magaziner<Magaziner, Ira<ls-thn-eq> acted 
appropriately. Any suggestion to the contrary is unfair and unsupported 
by the facts and the findings of the U.S. Attorney's Office in its 1995 
investigation of this matter.
    The U.S. Attorney's Office concluded that ``there is no basis to 
conclude that Mr. Magaziner committed a criminal offense in this matter. 
There is no significant evidence that his declaration was factually 
false, much less that it was willfully and intentionally so.''
    Mr. Magaziner<Magaziner, Ira<ls-thn-eq> is, and will remain, a 
valued member of my administration.

Note: In the statement, the President referred to U.S. District Judge 
Royce C. Lamberth.
