Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting Budget Rescissions
February 21, 1996

Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report three rescission proposals of budgetary 
resources, totaling $820 million. These rescissions offset the emergency 
FY 1996 Defense supplemental appropriations, which support the Bosnia 
peace implementation force. The rescissions affect the Department of 
Defense.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
report detailing the proposed rescissions was published in the Federal 
Register on March 5.
