Statement on the Oklahoma City Bombing Trials
December 23, 1997

    Two years ago, I told the families of the 168 innocent men, women, 
and children who perished in the Murrah Federal Building that they had 
lost too much, but they had not lost America, and that we would stand by 
them for as long as it took.
    The dedicated team of prosecutors and investigators who brought 
these cases to a successful conclusion have helped to fulfill that 
promise. The Nation is deeply in their debt.
    I know that no verdict in a court of law can ease the loss of a 
loved one. But the successful prosecution of Timothy McVeigh and Terry 
Nichols should offer a measure of comfort that all Americans stand with 
the families of Oklahoma City.
