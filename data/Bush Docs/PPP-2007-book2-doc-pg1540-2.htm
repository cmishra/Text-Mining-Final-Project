Remarks on Presenting the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor
December 12, 2007

    You know, one of the wonderful experiences of being a President is 
to welcome citizens who have served their communities with valor and 
compassion. And I--General<Mukasey, Michael B.<ls-thn-eq> and I are 
surrounded by four<Howland, Kevin<ls-thn-eq> such<Myers, Todd<ls-thn-eq> 
gentlemen<Van Orsdel, Kirk<ls-thn-eq> who<Loving, David<ls-thn-eq> have 
been heroic in their duties. They will tell you they were just doing 
their job; I'm telling you they did their job with extraordinary 
courage. And so it's been an honor to award them this precious medal. 
And I want to thank you all very much for joining us. Proud to call you 
fellow citizens.

Note: The President spoke at 2:11 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Attorney General Michael B. 
Mukasey.
