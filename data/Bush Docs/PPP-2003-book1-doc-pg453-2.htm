Statement on Senate Action To Block Votes on the Nominations of Miguel 
A. Estrada<Estrada, Miguel A.> and Priscilla Owen<Owen, 
Priscilla> Richman To Be United States Court of Appeals 
Circuit Judges
May 8, 2003

    Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen have been waiting 2 years for an 
up-or-down vote in the Senate. Both of these nominees are of the highest 
integrity and character with tremendous legal experience. Both have been 
unanimously rated ``well-qualified'' by the American Bar Association. 
Each has the support of a majority of Senators, yet votes on their 
nominations are being blocked by a minority of Senators who are engaged 
in simultaneous filibusters. These partisan obstructionist tactics are 
unprecedented, unacceptable, and inconsistent with the Senate's 
constitutional responsibility.
    Because of the Senate's failure to hold timely votes, the number of 
judicial vacancies has become unacceptably high. When the Federal courts 
are understaffed, they cannot act in a timely manner to resolve disputes 
that affect the lives and liberties of Americans.

    Mr. Estrada and Justice Owen represent the mainstream of American 
law and American values, possess extraordinary experience and integrity, 
and have strong bipartisan support from those who know them best. They 
will be outstanding circuit judges once they receive a vote and are 
confirmed.
    In recent days, many Senators of both parties have rightly spoken 
out about the broken confirmation process and reiterated the need for 
the Senate to ensure timely consideration of judicial nominees. I 
appreciate their call for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional 
responsibility and hold up-or-down votes on all judicial nominees within 
a reasonable time after nomination.
