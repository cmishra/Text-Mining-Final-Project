Nomination for Director of the Voice of America
March 16, 1994

    The President today announced the appointment of Geoffrey Cowan as 
the Director of the Voice of America (VOA) at the U.S. Information 
Agency. Cowan will serve as the 19th Director of VOA, the international 
radio broadcasting service of the U.S. Information Agency. His father, 
Louis G. Cowan, served as the second Director of VOA, from August 1, 
1943, to August 31, 1945.
    ``Geoffrey Cowan has been an important force in almost every facet 
of the communications world, as a public interest lawyer, best-selling 
author and award-winning teacher, playwright, television producer, and 
public servant,'' said the President. ``The Voice of America will be 
served well with another Cowan at its helm.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
