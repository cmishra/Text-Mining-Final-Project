Remarks Following a Meeting With Members of the Iraqi National Symphony
December 10, 2003

    Last night Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I had the honor of going 
to hear the Iraqi National Symphony play with the Washington Symphony at 
the Kennedy Center. It was an extraordinary event. And today I've had 
the honor of welcoming members of the symphony here at the White House. 
Maestro,<Ezzat, Mohammed Amin<ls-thn-eq> you did a superb job. Thank you 
very much.
    I'm also honored to be here with Rend al-Rahim,<Francke, Rend 
Rahim<ls-thn-eq> who is the Iraqi representative to the United States. 
Rend is an articulate defender of freedom and peace. I'm so honored 
you're here, Rend, and we look forward to working with you.
    We've had a very positive discussion here about freedom and hopes 
and aspirations of young and old alike. And I am so impressed by the 
spirit of these musicians. I'm so honored you would come to our country.
    It's very interesting that the Iraqi Symphony is made up of people 
who are Shi'a and Sunni and Armenian and Kurdish. They work for one 
thing, and that is a

unified sound, a beautiful sound. And that's the country that is now 
emerging in Iraq, a country that will work together and recognize 
everybody's rights. We're making good progress in Iraq. There's more to 
do, obviously, but the fact that the Iraqi Symphony is here and 
entertaining Americans is a sign of that progress.
    And we thank you all for coming. We wish you Godspeed.

Note: The President spoke at 2:01 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to Mohammed Amin Ezzat, 
conductor, Iraqi National Symphony; and Rend Rahim Francke, head of 
Iraq's Interest Section in the U.S. A tape was not available for 
verification of the content of these remarks.
