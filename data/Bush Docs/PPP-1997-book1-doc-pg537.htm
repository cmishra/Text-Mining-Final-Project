Exchange With Reporters on the Budget Agreement
May 2, 1997

    Q. Mr. President, have you got all the Democrats on board now?
    The President. A lot of them. I feel good about it.
    Q. Do you need to do a selling job to the American people? Do you 
think you need to sell this at all?
    The President. Oh, sure. We need to talk about it. We will. It's a 
good agreement, a good thing for America.
    Q. [Inaudible]
    The President. We're having them over here for a while.

Note: The exchange began at 6:05 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House, on the President's return from Baltimore, MD. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of this exchange.
