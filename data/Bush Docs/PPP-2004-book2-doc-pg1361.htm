Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Funding for the 
Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States 
Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction
July 16, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    In order to ensure the most effective counter-proliferation 
capabilities of the United States and respond effectively to the ongoing 
threat of terrorist activity, I am notifying the Congress of my intent 
to transfer $10 million from funds provided in Public Law 107-38, the 
2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and 
Response to Terrorist Acts on the United States, to the Commission on 
the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of 
Mass Destruction (the ``Commission'').
    These funds are necessary to support the essential activities of the 
Commission in assessing the capabilities and challenges of the 
intelligence community regarding the threat of weapons of mass 
destruction.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
