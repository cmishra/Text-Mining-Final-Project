Statement on the Transportation Department's Disadvantaged Business 
Enterprise Program
January 29, 1999

    For 6 years, our administration has worked hard to give more 
Americans the tools to make the most of their lives. Today I am pleased 
to announce that the Department of Transportation is reforming and 
strengthening a program designed to open the doors of economic 
opportunity for those who have too often been shut out.
    The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program gives thousands of 
minority-owned and women-owned business an opportunity to compete for 
State and local contracts to maintain our roads, construct new highways, 
and improve public transportation, among many other projects.
    After carefully considering hundreds of comments and suggestions 
from local leaders, business owners, and citizens from across the 
country, the Transportation Department has amended the DBE rules to 
ensure that this vitally important program works more fairly, more 
efficiently, and meets all constitutional requirements. The new rule is 
an excellent example of our efforts to mend, not end, affirmative 
action. I applaud the hard work and dedication of Secretary 
Slater<Slater, Rodney E.> and his staff to make sure that all 
Americans can share in this time of prosperity.
