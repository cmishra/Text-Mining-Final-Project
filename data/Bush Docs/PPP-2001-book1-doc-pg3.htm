Memorandum on Standards of Official Conduct
January 20, 2001

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Standards of Official Conduct

    Everyone who enters into public service for the United States has a 
duty to the American people to maintain the highest standards of 
integrity in Government. I ask you to ensure that all personnel within 
your departments and agencies are familiar with, and faithfully observe, 
applicable ethics laws and regulations, including the following general 
principles from the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the 
Executive Branch:

    (1) Public service is a public trust, requiring employees to place 
loyalty to the Constitution, the laws, and ethical principles above 
private gain.
    (2) Employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict with 
the conscientious performance of duty.
    (3) Employees shall not engage in financial transactions using 
nonpublic Government information or allow the improper use

of such information to further any private interest.
    (4) An employee shall not, except as permitted by applicable law or 
regulation, solicit or accept any gift or other item of monetary value 
from any person or entity seeking official action from, doing business 
with, or conducting activities regulated by the employee's agency, or 
whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or 
nonperformance of the employee's duties.
    (5) Employees shall put forth honest effort in the performance of 
their duties.
    (6) Employees shall not knowingly make unauthorized commitments or 
promises of any kind purporting to bind the Government.
    (7) Employees shall not use public office for private gain.
    (8) Employees shall act impartially and not give preferential 
treatment to any private organization or individual.
    (9) Employees shall protect and conserve Federal property and shall 
not use it for other than authorized activities.
    (10) Employees shall not engage in outside employment or activities, 
including seeking or negotiating for employment, that conflict with 
official Government duties and responsibilities.
    (11) Employees shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to 
appropriate authorities.
    (12) Employees shall satisfy in good faith their obligations as 
citizens, including all just financial obligations, especially those--
such as Federal, State, or local taxes--that are imposed by law.
    (13) Employees shall adhere to all laws and regulations that provide 
equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of race, color, religion, 
sex, national origin, age, or handicap.
    (14) Employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the 
appearance that they are violating applicable law or the ethical 
standards in applicable regulations.

    Executive branch employees should also be fully aware that their 
post-employment activities with respect to lobbying and other forms of 
representation will be bound by the restrictions of 18 U.S.C. 207.
    Please thank the personnel of your departments and agencies for 
their commitment to maintain the highest standards of integrity in 
Government as we serve the American people.

                                                          George W. Bush
