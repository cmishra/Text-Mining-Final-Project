Statement on Senate Action on Legislation To Establish a National
Drunk Driving Standard
June 15, 2000

    Today the Senate took an important step forward to keep drunk 
drivers off our Nation's streets. I congratulate the Senate for 
including a lifesaving measure championed by Senators 
Lautenberg<Lautenberg, Frank R.<ls-thn-eq> and Shelby<Shelby, Richard 
C.<ls-thn-eq> to set a national standard for impaired driving at .08 
blood alcohol content (BAC) in the Transportation appropriations bill 
that passed today. This reasonable standard will save hundreds of lives 
and prevent countless injuries each year--and it should be put in place 
across the country without further delay. I strongly urge the Congress 
to pass a final Transportation spending bill that includes this 
important initiative. Working together, we can help put the brakes on 
drunk drivers and make our streets safer for Americans across the 
Nation.
