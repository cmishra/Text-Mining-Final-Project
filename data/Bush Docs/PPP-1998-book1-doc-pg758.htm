Statement on the Death of Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
May 14, 1998

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of 
America's greatest environmentalists, Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Mrs. 
Douglas was 103 when I had the honor of awarding her the Medal of 
Freedom, and throughout her life, she was always ahead of her time. Long 
before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of 
our Nation's natural resources, particularly her beloved Florida 
Everglades. She was both inspiration and mentor for a generation of 
American conservationists, and her legacy will continue to call us to 
action on behalf of the environment.
