Statement on Action To Protect Retirement Plan Savings
December 11, 1995

    Hard-working Americans are doing their part to save for the future. 
Americans who work to support their families and save for retirement 
should not have to worry that the money they earned won't be there when 
they need it most.
    Today my administration is taking action to give the Government the 
tools necessary to assure American workers they can put their 401(k) 
savings into a system that is as safe as Fort Knox.
    Every American should be encouraged to set aside money for their 
retirement and make investments in their economic future. Our action 
will assure millions of Americans that they can put their savings and 
their trust into a financially sound retirement plan. My administration 
will continue to do its part to stand guard over Americans' retirement 
funds.
