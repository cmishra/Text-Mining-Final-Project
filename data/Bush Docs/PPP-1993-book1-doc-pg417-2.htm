Nomination for Posts at the Department of the Treasury
April 8, 1993

    The President intends to nominate George Munoz to be Assistant 
Secretary of the Treasury for Management and Chief Financial Officer, 
the White House announced today. The President also expressed his 
approval of Secretary Bentsen's choices for three positions. Joyce 
Carrier, Joan Logue-Kinder, and Marina Weiss will serve as Deputy 
Assistant Secretaries with responsibility for Public Liaison, Public 
Affairs, and Health, respectively.
    ``George Munoz has excelled in a variety of ways in both the private 
and public sectors,'' said the President. ``I am confident that he and 
the rest of Lloyd Bentsen's team at Treasury will keep that key 
Department running smoothly.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
