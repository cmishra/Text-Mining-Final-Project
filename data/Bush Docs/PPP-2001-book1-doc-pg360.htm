Message on the Observance of National Library Week
April 2, 2001

    I am pleased to join my fellow Americans in observing National 
Library Week.
    An educated citizenry provides the foundation for a free and 
democratic society. Libraries promote the sharing of knowledge, 
connecting people of all ages with valuable information resources. These 
dynamic and modern institutions, and the librarians who staff them, add 
immeasurably to our quality of life.
    Libraries serve as important centers for collecting, storing, and 
organizing information. Each year, more than 100,000 books are published 
in the United States alone, and the U.S. government publishes as many 
documents. Even beyond these numbers are incredible volumes of 
newspapers, magazines, and other copyrighted material.
    In public, government, professional, or academic facilities, 
librarians help individuals use numerous resources to complete the 
simplest or most complex of research-related tasks. This ability to 
search for information from the oldest manuscripts to the latest 
references available demonstrates the enduring versatility of libraries.
    During this special observance, I commend librarians for their 
contributions to education and learning throughout our Nation. I also 
encourage all Americans to visit their neighborhood library. Laura and I 
send our best wishes to the staff, volunteers, and patrons of libraries 
across America.

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: April 1-7, 2001, was designated National Library Week.
