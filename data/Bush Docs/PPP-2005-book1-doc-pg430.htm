Statement on the Anniversary of the Terrorist Attacks in Madrid, Spain
March 11, 2005

    On March 11, we remember the lives lost one year ago in Madrid.
    The bombings in Spain were a grim reminder that there are evil 
people in the world who are willing to kill innocent life. The 
terrorists hate and target every country that stands for democracy, 
tolerance, and freedom. They kill the innocent--children and their 
mothers on a commuter train--without conscience or mercy.
    The world is united in our determination to defeat global terrorism. 
We share a common faith in the value of freedom and the sanctity of 
life. We will continue to fight terror and advance freedom so that the 
world will be more peaceful.
    For those who lost loved ones on March 11, it has been a year of 
sorrow and a year of healing. I join all Americans in sending our 
expressions of sympathy and solidarity on this solemn day of 
remembrance.
    May God bless the people of Spain and the souls of the departed.
