Statement on Representative Dan Rostenkowski
May 31, 1994

    Like all Americans, Chairman Rostenkowski has the right to contest 
the charges made against him and to have his day in court. Chairman 
Rostenkowski and others have helped create real momentum for health care 
reform, and I am confident that legislation will pass this year.
