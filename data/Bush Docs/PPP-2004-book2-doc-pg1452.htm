a suburb of Wheeling. This is a new Cabela store. As you can see, it's

the area eventually. We currently have 450 people----
    The President. Four hundred fifty good people, I might add.
    Mr. Boldrick.<Boldrick, Mike<ls-thn-eq> ----on staff. We'll draw 
upwards of 5 or 6 million visitors a year to this location alone, making 
it the number one tourist attraction in the State of West Virginia.
    Marketing Manager John Castillo.<Castillo, John<ls-thn-eq> And the 
best news is, we're building two more of these down in Texas next year.
    The President. Oh, that's great.
    Mr. Boldrick.<Boldrick, Mike<ls-thn-eq> We'd like to present you 
with a Cabela's hat and a rain slicker.

1,200 new jobs is really good news for this part of the country.
    Mr. Boldrick.<Boldrick, Mike<ls-thn-eq> Absolutely.

operations. You picked a great place in the world to come.
