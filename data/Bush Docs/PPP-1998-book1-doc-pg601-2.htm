Statement on House Action on Campaign Finance Reform
April 22, 1998

    I am very pleased that the House Republican leadership will heed the 
call of congressional reformers and allow a vote on campaign finance 
reform. I strongly support the bipartisan legislation offered by 
Representatives Christopher Shays<Shays, Christopher<ls-thn-eq> and 
Marty Meehan,<Meehan, Martin T.<ls-thn-eq> which is the best chance in a 
generation for real reform. Similar legislation already has the support 
of a majority of Senators, yet it has been blocked by a minority on 
procedural grounds. Now every Member of the House of Representatives has 
a responsibility to vote for this measure to ban large soft money 
contributions, improve disclosure, and restrict backdoor campaign 
spending. A vote for bipartisan campaign finance reform will be a vote 
to strengthen our democracy and give ordinary voters a stronger voice.
