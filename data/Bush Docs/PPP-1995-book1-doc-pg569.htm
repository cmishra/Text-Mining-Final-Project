Statement on Senator David Pryor's Decision Not To Seek Reelection
April 21, 1995

    Throughout his career, David Pryor has been a champion of America's 
finest values. He is a fierce advocate for our children and the elderly 
and a ready voice for the cause of reason. From the State legislature 
and the Governor's office in Arkansas to the U.S. Congress, he has 
served our country from the bottom of his heart and in the best possible 
way. His retirement from the Senate will be a loss felt by us all.
    I know I can continue to count on David's exceptional counsel, both 
as a valued adviser and a trusted friend. I look forward to his 
continued active involvement in the business of our Nation.
