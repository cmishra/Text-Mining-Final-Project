Remarks on Presenting the Presidential Citizens Medals
November 17, 2008

    President Bush. Congratulations to our recipients. Welcome, the 
families and friends here at the White House.
    The Presidential Citizens Medal was created nearly four decades ago 
to recognize Americans who have performed exemplary service to our 
Nation. It is among one of the highest honors that can be conferred on a 
citizen. As President, I rarely have the opportunity to surprise 
anybody. [Laughter] It is tough to be stealthy with a security detail 
that comprises a 20-car motorcade. [Laughter] That makes me especially 
pleased to present the President's Citizens Medal to four outstanding 
and unsuspecting leaders in the arts: Bruce Cole,<Cole, Bruce<ls-thn-eq> 
Dana Gioia,<Gioia, Dana<ls-thn-eq> Adair Margo,<Margo, Adair 
Wakefield<ls-thn-eq> and Bob Martin.<Martin, Robert S.<ls-thn-eq> 
[Applause] No, no, not yet. Please do not rush the stage. [Laughter] 
Remember the big security detail? [Laughter]
    As leaders of our Government's cultural institutions, each<Cole, 
Bruce<ls-thn-eq> of<Gioia, Dana<ls-thn-eq> today's<Margo, Adair 
Wakefield<ls-thn-eq> recipients<Martin, Robert S.<ls-thn-eq> have made 
lasting contributions to American life and civic culture, and each is 
greatly deserving of this honor.
    As Chairman of the National Endowment of Humanities, Bruce 
Cole<Cole, Bruce<ls-thn-eq> has encouraged the study of American history 
through the ``We The People'' program and has helped preserve America's 
rich heritage for future generations.
    As Chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts, Dana Gioia<Gioia, 
Dana<ls-thn-eq> has combined his passion as a poet and his skill as a 
businessman to enrich the lives of Americans, from young readers to 
soldiers returning from war.
    As the Chairman of the President's Committee on the Arts and 
Humanities--and a fellow Texan--[laughter]--Adair Margo<Margo, Adair 
Wakefield<ls-thn-eq> has rallied support for American cultural 
institutions and has used the arts to strengthen our relationships with 
nations from Mexico to China.
    As former Director of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, 
Bob Martin<Martin, Robert S.<ls-thn-eq> has helped preserve our 
treasured collections and bring libraries and museums into the 21st 
century with new technology. He's helped recruit and train a new 
generation of librarians to replace the many skilled library 
professionals who are preparing to retire. I know of such person 
preparing to retire. [Laughter]
    Bob Martin's<Martin, Robert S.<ls-thn-eq> successor, Anne 
Radice,<Radice, Anne-Imelda M.<ls-thn-eq> could not be here. This is a 
stealthy ceremony. [Laughter] She's doing something else. But 
nevertheless, in appreciation of her service, she will be presented the 
Citizens Medal as well and is probably wondering why she was not 
notified. [Laughter]
    Each<Cole, Bruce<ls-thn-eq> of<Gioia, Dana<ls-thn-eq> today's<Margo, 
Adair Wakefield<ls-thn-eq> honorees<Martin, Robert S.<ls-thn-eq> 
understands that encouraging individual creativity and freedom of 
expression through the arts and scholarship strengthens and enhances our 
great country. And so I want to thank them for their service. I 
congratulate them. And now I ask the military aide<Beers, 
Clay<ls-thn-eq> to read the medal citations.

[At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Clay Beers, USN, Navy Aide to the President, 
read the citations, and the President presented the medals.]

    President Bush. Once again, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I thank 
you for coming. I hope you have found this day as joyous as we have. 
Congratulations. God bless.

Note: The President spoke at 1:35 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also
