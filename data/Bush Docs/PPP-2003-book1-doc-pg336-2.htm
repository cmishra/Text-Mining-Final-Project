Statement on Senate Action on the Budget Resolution
April 11, 2003

    The Senate has now completed action on the budget resolution that 
funds our priorities and rigorously controls spending. I look forward to 
working with the full Congress to provide the tax relief necessary to 
grow our economy and create jobs. The budget resolution provides for a 
jobs-and-growth package of up to $550 billion, and we will work with the 
Congress to provide the greatest amount of tax relief to stimulate our 
economy for American workers.
