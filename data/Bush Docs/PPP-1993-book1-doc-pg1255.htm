Statement on the Death of Representative Paul B. Henry
July 31, 1993

    Hillary and I received the news of Congressman Paul Henry's passing 
with deep sadness. It's tragic when such a productive and promising life 
is cut short so much before its time. His personal courage and bravery 
will be an inspiration for us. Our thoughts and prayers are with his 
family.
