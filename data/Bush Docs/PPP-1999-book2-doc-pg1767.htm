Statement on the Military Coup d'Etat in Pakistan
October 13, 1999

    The events in Pakistan this week represent another setback to 
Pakistani democracy. Pakistan's interests would be served by a prompt 
return to civilian rule and restoration of the democratic process. I 
urge that Pakistan move quickly in that direction.
    I am sending my Ambassador<Miland, William B.> back to 
Islamabad to underscore my view directly to the military authorities and 
to hear their intentions. I will also be consulting closely with all 
concerned nations about maintaining peace and stability in South Asia.
