Statement on the Observance of Nowruz
March 20, 2002

    I send warm greetings to Iranian-Americans and the Iranian people 
observing Nowruz, the traditional Persian New Year.
    This year's observance occurs at a time when our Nation is united in 
its determination to make the world safe from terrorism. The community 
of more than one million Iranian-Americans has fully participated in 
this noble endeavor by condemning the terrorist acts, participating in 
rescue efforts at Ground Zero, and offering help and support to the 
victims, who included individuals of Persian heritage.
    From arts and education to industry and science, Iranian-Americans 
have made significant and enduring contributions to the cultural and 
civic life of our Nation. Your observance of the traditional Persian New 
Year honors an ancient and storied history and marks a time of renewal. 
As the season changes, may your observance of Nowruz serve as a special 
time for you to reflect on your rich heritage and to enjoy the company 
of family and friends.
