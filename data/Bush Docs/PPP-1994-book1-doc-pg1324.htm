Statement on the National Rural Conference
July 27, 1994

    Rural America, which makes up a quarter of our population, is vital 
to the overall development of our Nation's economy and future. This 
administration is committed to working closely with rural communities in 
tackling the important issues of jobs, trade, and the preservation of 
the family farm as our Nation enters the next century.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the National Rural Conference scheduled for December 1.
