Remarks at the Swearing-In Ceremony for Howard H. Baker, Jr.,<Baker, 
Howard H., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> as Ambassador to Japan
June 26, 2001

    Senator Baker, you've drawn quite a crowd here to the White House. 
[Laughter] Mr. Vice President;<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> Mr. 
Secretary;<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> CIA Director George Tenet,<Tenet, 
George J.<ls-thn-eq> I believe, is here. Justice O'Connor<O'Connor, 
Sandra Day<ls-thn-eq> is here. Thank you so much for coming. The 
Ambassador from Japan<Yanai, Shunji<ls-thn-eq> is here. Thank you very 
much for being here, Mr. Ambassador, and your lovely wife.<Yanai, 
Toshiko<ls-thn-eq> Madeleine Albright,<Albright, Madeline K.<ls-thn-eq> 
I believe, is here--Madam Secretary. Larry Eagleburger<Eagleburger, 
Lawrence S.<ls-thn-eq> is here. Elizabeth Dole,<Dole, 
Elizabeth<ls-thn-eq> I believe, is here. Senator,<Dole, Bob<ls-thn-eq> 
Elizabeth, thank you very much. The former Ambassadors to the country of 
Japan are on the stage with us; they have been introduced. Members of 
the United States Senate are here. Members of the Tennessee 
congressional delegation are here.
    Thank you all for coming, and welcome. Today we call upon one of 
America's most valued statesmen to help be the keeper of one of 
America's most valued friendships. Howard Baker has held many titles 
during the course of his long and distinguished career. They include 
sailor, Senator, minority leader, majority leader, and White House Chief 
of Staff. In a few moments he'll add Ambassador to that list, and once 
again, America is very grateful.
    All the former Ambassadors here are living examples of the very 
highest standards of diplomatic excellence. And between them, Mike 
Mansfield,<Mansfield, Michael J.<ls-thn-eq> Walter Mondale,<Mondale, 
Walter F.<ls-thn-eq>

Tom Foley,<Foley, Thomas S.<ls-thn-eq> and Howard Baker have accumulated 
over 100 years of elected office. [Laughter] That's a lot of balloon 
drops. [Laughter]
    Thirty-four of those years are accounted for by Mike 
Mansfield<Mansfield, Michael J.<ls-thn-eq> alone. The Senator began the 
tradition of high-level political figures serving as our Ambassador to 
Japan. He held that post for more than 11 years, longer than anyone 
else. Japanese press calls these figures o-mono--the big guys. 
[Laughter] Well, we're all very honored to have the original big guy 
with us.
    And by the way, Senator Thurmond,<Thurmond, Strom<ls-thn-eq> he 
informed me--with quite clear language--that he is 4 months younger than 
you are. [Laughter]
    We send the very best people to Japan because the United States has 
no more important partner in the world than Japan. Our alliance is 
rooted in the vital strategic and economic interests that we share. It 
is the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Asia. Today, this 
partnership is helping us tackle global problems, as well.
    I'm looking forward to welcoming the Prime Minister<Koizumi, 
Junichiro<ls-thn-eq> this weekend at Camp David. Together, we will 
explore ways we can continue to strengthen our security relationship. We 
will talk about the Prime Minister's agenda for reforming and 
revitalizing the Japanese economy. We'll discuss how our countries can 
work together on realistic and effective responses to global problems 
such as AIDS in Africa and climate change.
    I will also tell the Prime Minister<Koizumi, Junichiro<ls-thn-eq> 
that America's 38th Ambassador to Japan is a man of extraordinary 
ability, grace, and good humor. In every post he has held, Howard Baker 
has brought uncommon intelligence and an uncanny ability to calm the 
ship of state, even in days of crisis.
    He comes from good stock. His grandmother, Lillie ``Mother Ladd'' 
Mauser--[laughter]--was Tennessee's first woman sheriff. [Laughter] His 
father and his step-mother both served in the House. He married into 
good stock, as well. He counts Senator Everett Dirksen and the grand old 
man of the Grand Old Party, Alf Landon, as fathers-in-law. And what the 
Prime Minister<Koizumi, Junichiro<ls-thn-eq> is going to find out, he 
took an extraordinary woman as a bride in Senator Nancy Kassebaum 
Baker.<Baker, Nancy Kassebaum<ls-thn-eq>
    In the Senate, Howard Baker had a list of rules for being an 
effective Senator. He called it the Baker's Dozen. The list included: 
listen more often than you speak; be patient; tell the truth, whether 
you have to or not; and finally, be civil and encourage others to do the 
same.
    Well, these rules help explain why Howard Baker has made such a mark 
on American history. They are why he's going to keep making his mark for 
the years to come.
    Congratulations.

Note: The President spoke at 2:48 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Shunji Yanai, Japanese Ambassador 
to the United States, and his wife, Toshiko; former Secretary of State 
Madeleine K. Albright; former Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger; former Senator Bob Dole and his wife, former Transportation 
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan. 
The transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also 
included the remarks of Ambassador Baker.
