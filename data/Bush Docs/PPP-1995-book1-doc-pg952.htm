Statement on the Attempted Assassination of President Hosni Mubarak of 
Egypt
June 26, 1995

    On behalf of the American people, I wish to express my outrage at 
the attempt made today by terrorists to assassinate President Mubarak of 
Egypt. I am relieved that President Mubarak was not harmed and has now 
returned safely to Cairo.
    The United States stands by Egypt--our partner for peace and 
prosperity in the Middle East and around the world--at this moment. The 
enemies of peace will not be allowed to thwart the peaceful hopes of the 
peoples of the region, and the efforts of President Mubarak and the 
peace makers to make those hopes a reality.
