Remarks Following a Briefing at the National Security Agency at Fort 
Meade, Maryland
October 24, 2008

    I want to thank General Alexander<Alexander, Keith B.<ls-thn-eq> for 
his hospitality to me and the Vice President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> and 
Director McConnell.<McConnell, J. Michael<ls-thn-eq> We have been here 
at NSA, which is on the frontline of protecting the American people. 
Every time I come out here, I'm impressed by the caliber of people who 
work here, the amount of energy that goes into their jobs, and their 
deep desire to find an enemy and bring them to justice before they hurt 
us again.
    Ever since 9/11, the people in this building have done what the 
country expects them to do, and that is to work as hard as necessary to 
help protect the United States of America. The work here at the NSA is 
absolutely vital, and I wish all our citizens could meet the folks that 
work here and realize how smart they are, how capable they are, and how 
enthusiastic they are in doing their duty.
    So, General,<Alexander, Keith B.<ls-thn-eq> thank you for your 
hospitality. We've enjoyed coming out here, and appreciate the efforts 
you're putting into protecting the homeland.
    Thank you all very much.

Note: The President spoke at 12:50 p.m. in the Operations Building. In 
his remarks, he referred to Lt. Gen. Keith B. Alexander, USA, Director, 
National Security Agency.
