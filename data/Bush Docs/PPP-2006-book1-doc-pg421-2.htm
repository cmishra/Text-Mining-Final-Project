Remarks Following a Meeting on Faith-Based and Community Initiatives
March 9, 2006

    We just had a very interesting dialog here. I want to thank members 
of the faith community, the community-based action community, the 
corporate community, the foundation community for joining in a dialog 
about how we can continue to foster the good works of millions of our 
fellow citizens who deeply care about the future of our country and the 
plight of their fellow citizen.
    One of the things that always strengthens my belief in our future is 
my understanding of how many acts of kindness take place on a daily 
basis in the United States, and it doesn't require any government edict 
or government law. People really care about the future of our country; 
millions of our citizens weep when they know somebody hurts. But 
nevertheless, there still needs to be focused efforts on encouraging 
more giving of money and time.
    So I want to thank you all very much for joining us. Appreciate your 
being social entrepreneurs. I thank you for really strengthening the 
heart of the United States of America. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:49 a.m. at the Washington Hilton Hotel.
