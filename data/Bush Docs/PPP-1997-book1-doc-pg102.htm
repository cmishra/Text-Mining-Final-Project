Letter to Congressional Leaders on Funding for International 
Family Planning
January 31, 1997

Dear __________:
    Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 518A(d) of the 
Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208) (the ``Act''), I hereby 
find that the July 1, 1997, limitation on obligations imposed by 
subsection (a) of section 518A is having a negative impact on the proper 
functioning of the population planning program. Subject to a joint 
resolution of approval by the Congress to be adopted no later than 
February 28, 1997, as specified in section 518A(d) of the Act, funds for 
these activities may be made available beginning March 1, 1997.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives; Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate; Ted 
Stevens, chairman, and Robert C. Byrd, ranking member, Senate Committee 
on Appropriations; and Robert L. Livingston, chairman, and David R. 
Obey, ranking member, House Committee on Appropriations.
