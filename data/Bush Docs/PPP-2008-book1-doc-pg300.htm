Statement on the Resignation of Donald E. Powell<Powell, Donald 
E.<ls-thn-eq> as Coordinator of Gulf Coast Region Recovery and 
Rebuilding
February 29, 2008

    Don Powell is an exceptional leader who has worked tirelessly and 
effectively to help the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast region 
recover and rebuild from one of our Nation's most destructive natural 
disasters.
    Don brought to the job of coordinating our Federal rebuilding 
efforts the perfect combination of talent, temperament, experience, and 
compassion. Today, due in part to his leadership and outstanding work 
with State and local leaders, the Gulf Coast is on the road to recovery. 
While challenges remain, the region is open for business, critical 
infrastructure is being rebuilt, and schools are up and running. People 
are reclaiming their lives, and our Nation owes Don a debt of gratitude. 
I appreciate his service to the country and thank him for his 
dedication.
    I am also grateful to Paul Conway,<Conway, Paul<ls-thn-eq> Don's 
chief of staff, who will assume the duties of the Federal Coordinator 
for the Office of Gulf Coast Rebuilding in the interim.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish Don well as he returns to 
Texas.
