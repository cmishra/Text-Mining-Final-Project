Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
August 19, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period April 1, 1999, to May 31, 1999. The 
previous submission covered events during February 1999 and March 1999.
    NATO's 50th Anniversary Summit in Washington this past April brought 
an opportunity to engage with Greek and Turkish leaders on the Cyprus 
problem. I met there with Turkish President Demirel<Demirel, 
Suleyman> and Greek Prime Minister Simitis<Simitis, 
Konstandinos> to underscore the importance of a just and 
lasting solution for all Cypriots. Secretary of State Madeleine 
K.<Albright, Madeleine K.> Albright delivered a similar 
message to her Greek and Turkish counterparts in discussions on the 
possibilities for resuming negotiations in the fall. My Administration 
will continue efforts to bring about a settlement based on a bizonal, 
bicommunal federation.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on August 20.
