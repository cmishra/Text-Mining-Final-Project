Russia-United States Joint Statement on Cooperation To Combat
Global Warming
June 4, 2000

    President of the United States Clinton and President of the Russian 
Federation Putin<Putin, Vladimir<ls-thn-eq> reaffirm the commitment of 
the United States and the Russian Federation to cooperate in taking 
action to reduce the serious risks of global warming. They take note of 
the significant contributions to environmental protection made by the 
U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technical Cooperation 
under the co-chairmanship of Vice President Gore<Gore, Albert, 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and the Prime Minister of the Russian 
Federation.<Kasyanov, Mikhail<ls-thn-eq>
    The Presidents declare their conviction that national and global 
economic growth can be achieved while continuing to protect the global 
climate. They note with approval the close cooperation of the two 
countries in multilateral negotiations to elaborate upon elements of the 
Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The 
Presidents stress the importance of fully developing the Protocol's 
flexibility mechanisms, including international emissions trading and 
joint implementation, which are essential to achieving countries' 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction commitments under the Protocol. 
They believe transparent rules for these mechanisms must be developed.
    The Presidents further note the potential of the Kyoto Protocol 
mechanisms to promote investment in all areas where it is possible to 
limit or reduce GHG emissions. They reaffirm the opposition of the U.S. 
and Russian governments to proposals that limit the Kyoto Protocol 
mechanisms by placing quantitative restrictions on the transfer of 
Parties' assigned amounts. The Presidents reiterate the commitment of 
their governments to work for agreement on these and other issues at the 
Sixth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties taking place in The Hague 
in November of this year.
    Building upon previous joint accomplishments, the U.S. and Russia 
plan to continue their cooperation on the problem of global climate 
change.
    President Clinton declares the intention of the Government of the 
United States of America to continue cooperation with Russia in the 
measurement and reporting of GHG emissions, the development of market-
based tools for managing those emissions, and the identification of 
specific opportunities in Russia to further reduce or sequester those 
emissions.
    President Putin,<Putin, Vladimir<ls-thn-eq> noting the significant 
contributions made by the Russian Federation to reduce emissions of 
greenhouse gases, declares the intention of the Russian Federation to 
expand and strengthen the mutually-beneficial U.S.-Russian cooperation 
in the area of the fight against global warming, paying special 
attention to the activities of the Joint Russian-American Climate Policy 
Working Group.

    Through these actions, Presidents Clinton and Putin express their 
conviction that effective steps can be taken by political leaders, and 
by leaders in scientific, business, and other circles, to protect the 
planet that we share from the threat of global warming.
