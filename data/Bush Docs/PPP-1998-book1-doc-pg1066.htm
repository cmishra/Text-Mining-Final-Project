Statement on the Supreme Court Decision in Bragdon v. Abbott
June 26, 1998

    I am pleased with today's Supreme Court decision in Bragdon v. 
Abbott. This decision reinforces the protections offered by the landmark 
Americans with Disabilities Act for Americans living with HIV and AIDS. 
The ADA was enacted with strong bipartisan support to protect Americans 
with disabilities from discrimination. My administration argued 
successfully in this case that people with HIV are disabled whether or 
not they have developed the symptoms of AIDS.
    I am firmly committed to protecting all Americans, including those 
living with HIV and AIDS, from discrimination, and ensuring that each of 
us can benefit from all America has to offer. Today's decision will help 
in fulfilling that commitment.
