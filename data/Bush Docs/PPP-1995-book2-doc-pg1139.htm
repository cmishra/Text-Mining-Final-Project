Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Tel Aviv, Israel
July 24, 1995

    On behalf of all Americans, I offer my deepest condolences to the 
Government and people of Israel at this tragic moment. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with the victims of this terrorist atrocity and their loved 
ones.

    We join with all those working for peace in expressing our outrage 
and condemning in the strongest possible manner this brutal act. Those 
responsible are seeking to deny to Israelis and Palestinians alike the 
realization of a new and better life of peace and hope. But they shall 
not be allowed to succeed. Their vision is of the past, not of the 
future, of hatred, not the reconciliation which Israeli and Palestinian 
peacemakers are striving to achieve.

    Peace requires courage. The people of Israel have demonstrated 
enormous resolve and determination in pursuing the path of peace. 
Through times of suffering as well as rejoicing, the Government and 
people of the United States stand with them.
