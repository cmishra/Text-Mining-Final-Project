Statement on Senate Confirmation of Michael V. Hayden<Hayden, Michael 
V.<ls-thn-eq> as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency
May 26, 2006

    I commend the Senate for confirming Michael Hayden as Director of 
the Central Intelligence Agency by a bipartisan majority. Winning the 
war on terror requires that America have the best intelligence possible, 
and his strong leadership will ensure that we do. General Hayden is a 
patriot and a dedicated public servant whose broad experience, 
dedication, and expertise make him the right person to lead the CIA at 
this critical time. I look forward to working with Ambassador 
Negroponte, General Hayden, and the other leaders of our intelligence 
community as we continue to address the challenges and threats we face 
in the 21st century. I congratulate General Hayden and his family on his 
confirmation and thank him for his continued service to our Nation.
