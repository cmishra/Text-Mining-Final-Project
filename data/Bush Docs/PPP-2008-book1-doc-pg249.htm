Remarks During a Lunch With Peace Corps Volunteers in Accra
February 20, 2008

    Ambassador,<Bridgewater, Pamela E.<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much 
for setting up this lunch. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I and 
Condi<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> are thrilled to be with some of our 
most notable citizens. These are folks who have left the comfort of 
America to join the Peace Corps to serve humanity, and we're really 
looking forward to hearing your stories and hearing what life is like.
    And one of the things I tell our country all the time is, our great 
strength lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens. And I don't think 
there's any more giving people than the Peace Corps volunteers. And so, 
Robert,<Golledge, Robert W., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much for 
joining us and bringing along some of the--our fellow citizens who are 
making a huge difference in people's lives.
    I'm sure you would like to share a few remarks.

[At this point, the discussion continued, and no transcript was
