Message to the Congress Extending the Period of Production of the Naval 
Petroleum Reserve
October 2, 2008

To the Congress of the United States:
    Consistent with section 7422(c)(2) of title 10, United States Code, 
I am informing you of my decision to extend the period of production of 
the Naval Petroleum Reserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, 2009, 
the expiration date of the currently authorized period of production.
    Attached is a copy of the report investigating continued production 
of the Reserves, consistent with section 7422(c)(2)(B) of title 10. In 
light of the findings contained in the report, I certify that continued 
production from the Naval Petroleum Reserves is in the national 
interest.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,
