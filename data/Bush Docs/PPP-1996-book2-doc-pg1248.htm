Message to the Senate Transmitting the United Nations Convention
To Combat Desertification
August 2, 1996

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 
Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, 
Particularly in Africa, with Annexes, adopted at Paris, June 17, 1994, 
and signed by the United States on October 14, 1994. The report of the 
Department of State is also enclosed for the information of the Senate.
    The purpose of the Convention is to combat desertification and 
mitigate the effects of drought on arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid 
lands through effective action at all levels. In particular, the 
Convention addresses the fundamental causes of famine and food 
insecurity in Africa, by stimulating more effective partnership between 
governments, local communities, nongovernmental organizations, and aid 
donors, and by encouraging the dissemination of information derived from 
new technology (e.g., early warning of impending drought) to farmers.
    The United States has strongly supported the Convention's innovative 
approach to combatting dryland degradation. I believe it will help 
Africans and others to make better use of fragile resources without 
requiring increased development assistance. Ratification by the United 
States would promote effective implementation of the Convention and is 
likely to encourage similar action by other countries whose 
participation would also promote effective implementation.
    United States obligations under the Convention would be met under 
existing law and ongoing assistance programs.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and its Annexes, with the declaration described in 
the accompanying report of the Secretary of State, and give its advice 
and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

August 2, 1996.
