Statement on the Settlement of Railroad Contract Disputes
July 30, 1996

    These agreements represent a triumph of the collective bargaining 
process. I commend the parties for their hard work in reaching these 
settlements. I also commend our Presidential Emergency Boards for 
developing recommendations that helped to bring about these resolutions.
    In the past 25 years, Congress has had to step in no fewer than 10 
times to prevent national rail stoppages. Such stoppages can cost 
American businesses and consumers billions of dollars. The voluntary 
contract agreements achieved this year broke that pattern and represent 
a milestone for labor-management relations.
