Message on the Observance of Cinco de Mayo, 1997
May 5, 1997

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
    The life of our nation has been continually renewed and strengthened 
by the many different people who choose to come here and become our 
fellow citizens. Each brings a part of his or her own heritage, which 
over time becomes part of our common heritage. As we seek to become a 
more united people, we must not forget our roots, for they remind us of 
who we are and of what we have to share with others.
    This year, as we celebrate the 135th anniversary of the Mexican 
Army's triumph at the Battle of Puebla, we realize anew how much our 
nation has been enriched by the people and culture of Mexico and how 
closely our futures are intertwined. The U.S.-Mexican relationship is 
one of the closest our nation has today, and it is most appropriate that 
my visit to Mexico should begin on Cinco de Mayo.
    On this day devoted to victory, pride, and independence, let us 
rededicate ourselves to strengthening the bonds of friendship and 
partnership between Mexico and the United States.

Let us work together to ensure that the legacy of courage and freedom we 
commemorate on Cinco de Mayo will continue to inspire us as we look 
forward to the promise of the twenty-first century.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a wonderful holiday.

                                                      William J. Clinton
