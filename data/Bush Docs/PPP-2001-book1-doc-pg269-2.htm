Statement on Signing Legislation To Repeal Federal Ergonomics 
Regulations
March 20, 2001

    Today I have signed into law S.J. Res. 6, a measure that repeals an 
unduly burdensome and overly broad regulation dealing with ergonomics. 
This is the first time the Congressional Review Act has been put to use. 
This resolution is a good and proper use of the Act because the 
different branches of our Government need to be held accountable.
    There needs to be a balance between and an understanding of the 
costs and benefits associated with Federal regulations. In this 
instance, though, in exchange for uncertain benefits, the ergonomics 
rule would have cost both large and small employers billions of dollars 
and presented employers with overwhelming compliance challenges. Also, 
the rule would have applied a bureaucratic one-size-fits-all solution to 
a broad range of employers and workers--not good government at work.
    The safety and health of our Nation's workforce is a priority for my 
Administration. Together we will pursue a comprehensive approach to 
ergonomics that addresses the concerns surrounding the ergonomics rule 
repealed today. We will work with the Congress, the business community, 
and our Nation's workers to address this important issue.

                                                          George W. Bush
