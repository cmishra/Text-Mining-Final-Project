Exchange With Reporters in Ottawa
February 24, 1995

Secretary of State Christopher

    Q. Mr. President, how did you find Secretary Christopher?
    The President. He was doing well this morning. I had a great talk 
with him. And he feels good, and he's going to go home with us this 
afternoon.
    Q. Will he be able to get back to work soon?
    The President. I'm encouraged.
    Q. Would it affect the Mideast trip at all, sir?
    Q. [Inaudible]--that's what gave him the ulcer? [Laughter]
    The President. Gee, I hope not. [Laughter]

Note: The exchange began at 10:30 a.m. at the Parliament. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of this exchange.
