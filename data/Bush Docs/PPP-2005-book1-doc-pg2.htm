Statement on the Death of Representative Robert T. Matsui<Matsui, Robert 
T.<ls-thn-eq>
January 2, 2005

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by the passing of 
Bob Matsui. Bob Matsui was a dedicated public servant and a good and 
decent man who served with distinction and integrity in the U.S. House 
of Representatives for more than 25 years. In the Congress, he was a 
leader of his party admired by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
Through long-time service on the House Ways and Means Committee, he 
helped pass important legislation on issues ranging from trade to small 
business to child welfare to mass transit. He was always devoted to 
California and his native Sacramento, where he served on the city 
council and as vice mayor in the 1970s. A third-generation Japanese 
American, Bob was interned along with his family during World War II. 
Four decades later, he played a leading role in Congress in securing 
passage of the landmark Japanese American Redress Act. Laura and I send 
our prayers and condolences to Doris,<Matsui, Doris Okada<ls-thn-eq> 
their son Brian,<Matsui, Brian<ls-thn-eq> and the entire Matsui family.
