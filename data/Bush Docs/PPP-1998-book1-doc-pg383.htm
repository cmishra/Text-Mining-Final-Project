Statement on Proposed Tobacco Legislation
March 16, 1998

    I congratulate the public health and tobacco producer communities 
for working together to promote bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco 
legislation that dramatically reduces youth smoking and protects 
American farmers and their communities. I am firmly committed to 
protecting farmers and their communities and have made this commitment 
one of the five key elements that I will insist upon before signing 
tobacco legislation. I hope you will continue your efforts to expand 
your coalition and to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation this year 
that protects our Nation's children.
