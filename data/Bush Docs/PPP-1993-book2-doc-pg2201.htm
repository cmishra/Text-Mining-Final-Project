Message on the Observance of Christmas
December 22, 1993

    Warmest greetings to all who are celebrating Christmas in this 
season of hope.
    Each year at this time, we gather together with our loved ones. We 
teach our children to believe that, with faith and hard work, their 
dreams can come true. We reach out to each other in caring and 
fellowship. We look to the future with hope and always with the most 
earnest of mankind's prayers--the prayer for peace. Thankfully, at this 
Christmastime, we can joyously celebrate the results of our prayers.

crime and violence that still threaten us. This has indeed been a year

world. This year, let us listen to the dreams of our children and gain 
strength from their idealism. On this holiday, let us reach out to the 
people around us and work for a world at peace.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a very merry 
Christmas.

                                                            Bill Clinton
