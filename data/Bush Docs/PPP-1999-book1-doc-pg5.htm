Statement on the Launch of the New European Currency
 January 4, 1999

    We welcome the launch of the euro, an historic step that 11 nations 
in Europe have taken toward a more complete Economic and Monetary Union 
(EMU). The United States has long been an advocate for European 
integration, and we admire the steady progress that Europe has 
demonstrated in taking the often difficult budget decisions that make 
this union possible. A strong and stable Europe, with open markets and 
robust growth, is good for America and for the world. A successful 
economic union that contributes to a dynamic Europe is clearly in our 
long-term interests.
