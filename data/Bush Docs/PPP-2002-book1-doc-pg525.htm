Statement on the Klamath River Basin Federal Working Group
March 29, 2002

    I am pleased with the progress being made by the Klamath River Basin 
Federal Working Group in addressing the problems facing the people of 
this region. Under the leadership of Secretary Norton,<Norton, Gale 
A.> the working group is providing water to farmers who depend 
on it for a living, while taking careful steps to protect and enhance 
the health of fish populations in the Klamath River Basin. The working 
group is undertaking new environmental restoration projects in the area 
and has initiated a dialog with native tribes about long-term solutions 
to the natural resource and native rights issues in the basin.
    The times are still difficult for many in the region, and much work 
remains to be done. It is essential that the citizens of Oregon and 
California in the Klamath River Basin--whether farmer, rancher, tribe 
member, fisherman, or environmental activist--embrace compromise and 
seek understanding. The working group's rapid progress, combined with 
the efforts of Senator Gordon Smith<Smith, Gordon> and 
Representative Greg Walden,<Walden, Greg> give me great hope 
for a lasting solution to the challenges of the Klamath River Basin.
