Statement on the Bosnia-Herzegovina Framework Agreement
March 1, 1994

    I warmly welcome the signing today in Washington of a framework 
agreement establishing a federation in the areas of the Republic of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina with majority Bosnian and Croat populations. This 
framework agreement also provides the outline of a preliminary agreement 
for a confederation with the Republic of Croatia. This is a major step 
in the search for peace in Bosnia. I am especially pleased with the 
tireless efforts of my Special Envoy, Charles Redman, and those of 
Croatian Foreign Minister Granic, Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic, and 
Mr. Kresimir Zubak, representing the Bosnian Croats.
    I spoke this evening with President Alija Izetbegovic of the 
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I congratulated him for his 
leadership and the critical role he has played in this achievement. All 
of us are heartened by the courage that he and the Bosnian people have 
shown in their struggle for peace.
    I also spoke with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia to convey my 
admiration for the statesmanship he has shown in forging this agreement. 
I underscored the support of the United States for the sovereignty and 
integrity of his country.
    A great deal of work remains to be done to bring a full peace to 
Bosnia. The United States will continue to work closely with the parties 
throughout this process. I urge the parties to continue to demonstrate 
the flexibility and statesmanship that has brought them to this point. I 
urge them to persevere over the coming weeks to help ensure that today's 
accomplishments lead to the peace so long overdue.
