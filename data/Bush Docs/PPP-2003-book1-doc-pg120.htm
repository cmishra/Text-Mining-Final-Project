Memorandum on Declaration Under the Stafford Act for Louisiana: Space 
Shuttle Columbia
February 1, 2003

Memorandum for the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency

Subject: Declaration Under the Stafford Act for Louisiana: Space Shuttle 
Columbia

    I have determined that the emergency conditions in certain areas of 
the State of Louisiana in connection with the events relating to the 
loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003, are of 
sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant an emergency declaration 
under section 501(b) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. 5121-5206 (the ``Stafford Act''). 
The basis for my decision to make this declaration pursuant to section 
501(b) of the Stafford Act includes the fact that the space shuttle and 
the space program are Federal property and Federal programs. I, 
therefore, declare that such an emergency exists in the State of 
Louisiana.
    In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to 
coordinate and direct other Federal agencies and fund activities not 
authorized under other Federal statutes and allocate from funds 
available for these purposes, such amounts as you find necessary for 
Federal emergency assistance and administrative expenses.
    Pursuant to this emergency declaration, you are authorized to 
provide emergency

assistance as you deem appropriate under title V of the Stafford Act at 
100 percent Federal funding.
    Further, you are authorized to make changes to this declaration to 
the extent allowable under the Stafford Act.

                                                          George W. Bush
