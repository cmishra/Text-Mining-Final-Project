Nomination for Posts at the Department of Defense
March 31, 1993

    The President will nominate Dr. Anita Jones to be Director of 
Defense Research and Engineering and Graham Allison, Edwin Dorn, and 
Morton Halperin to be Assistant Secretaries of Defense for Plans and 
Policy, Personnel and Readiness, and Democracy and Human Rights 
respectively, the White House announced today.
    ``At this time of change and uncertainty, it is imperative that we 
have a topflight team at the Pentagon,'' said the President. ``These 
four people have what it takes to keep the Defense Department moving 
forward.''

the Press Secretary.
