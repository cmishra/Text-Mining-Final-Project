    Cinco de Mayo commemorates a joyful moment in Mexican history. 
Tonight we're proud to celebrate that moment together. The United States 
and Mexico are united by ties of family, faith in God, and a deep love 
for freedom.
    More than 25 million men and women of Mexican origin now make their 
homes in the United States. And they're making our Nation more vibrant 
and more hopeful every day. Mexican Americans have enriched the American 
experience with contributions to music and dancing and the arts. Latino 
entrepreneurs are starting their own businesses all across America and 
are creating jobs and trading in freedom with businesses across borders. 
More Hispanic Americans own their own homes today than ever before. And 
Mexican Americans are firmly committed to leaving no child behind in 
America.
    Mexican Americans are also strengthening our country with their 
patriotism and

service. Thousands of Mexican Americans have sacrificed in the Armed 
Services for our freedom. And more than 8,700 men and women born in 
Mexico now wear the uniform of the United States military. These 
dedicated men and women are making America safer, and they're making the 
world safer. And they're carrying on the courage and devotion that 
inspired an outnumbered band of Mexican soldiers to victory in the 
Battle of Pueblo on the cinco de Mayo, 1862.
    Here at the White House, the triumph of Cinco de Mayo was recognized 
by President Abraham Lincoln. And through the generations, Americans 
have continued to look on our neighbor to the south with fondness and 
deep respect. Tonight we look to the future with confidence in our warm 
and growing friendship.
    And so now it is my pleasure to offer a toast: May God bless the 
people of Mexico and all the sons and daughters of Mexico who call 
America home. Que Dios los bendiga.

Note: The President spoke at 8:01 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White

Hinojosa, Chair, U.S. Sentencing Commission; Mexico's Ambassador to the
