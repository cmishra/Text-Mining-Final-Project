Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting Budget Deferrals
October 22, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report two deferrals of budgetary resources, 
totaling $167.6 million.
    The deferrals affect programs of the Department of State and 
International Security Assistance.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on October 23. 
The report detailing the deferrals was published in the Federal Register 
on November 17.
