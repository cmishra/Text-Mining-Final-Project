Statement on the Death of Clark M. Clifford
October 10, 1998

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Clark Clifford, 
an American statesman who helped shape half a century's struggle for 
freedom. From his first days by President Truman's side as a young naval 
aide, to his wise counsel to President Carter, he was someone upon whom 
Presidents could rely for judicious

and effective advice. When his wisdom and experience were needed, which 
was often, he offered it with charm, grace, and a certain humility. As 
Secretary of Defense at a critical time under President Johnson, he 
helped to begin the search for peace in Vietnam. His legacy of public 
service is notable in our history. Our thoughts and prayers go to his 
wife, Marny, and their three daughters.
