Statement on Disaster Assistance for California
January 13, 1995

    Today I am sending to the State of California $10 million from the 
disaster relief fund. These funds will be used by the State and local 
governments in the flooded areas to remove debris and to take protective 
measures to ensure the health and safety of their residents.
    At this time, I have approved Federal assistance for 34 California 
counties stricken by the disastrous floods. Our hearts go out to the 
people who have suffered losses in these disastrous floods. I have asked 
James L. Witt, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
to make certain that all appropriate resources of the Federal Government 
are applied to assist the State of California in helping their citizens 
to begin to recover from this disaster. The action I have taken today 
will be a start for California residents down the difficult road to 
recovery.
