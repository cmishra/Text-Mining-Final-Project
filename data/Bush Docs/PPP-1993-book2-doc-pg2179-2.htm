Letter on the Swearing-In of John D. Holum as Director of the         
United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
December 15, 1993

Dear John:
    I am delighted to extend my congratulations as you are sworn in as 
the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
    There are few challenges more pressing today than arms control and 
nonproliferation. Already we have taken several steps to address these 
challenges. In the past year, we have submitted the Chemical Weapons 
Treaty to the Senate. We have ratified the Open Skies Treaty. We have 
advanced new proposals on a comprehensive test ban and the ABM Treaty, 
and have made substantial progress in the de-nuclearization of the 
States of the Former Soviet Union. We have elevated nonproliferation on 
the national agenda and with your leadership will be pursuing a range of 
measures such as focused regional strategies and comprehensive

approaches to the dangers posed by fissile materials. These steps and 
others we will take together can make our people safer and our nation 
more secure.
    Much remains to be done to meet these challenges. Under your 
guidance, ACDA will play a crucial role in advancing the full range of 
our arms control and nonproliferation agenda. I look forward to having 
the benefit of your counsel, your expertise and your leadership skills 
as we work together to ensure a safer world for generations to come.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
December 16.
