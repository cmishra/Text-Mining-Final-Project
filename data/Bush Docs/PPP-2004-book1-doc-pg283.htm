Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Legislation To Protect 
Unborn Victims of Violence
February 26, 2004

    I applaud the House for passing the ``Unborn Victims of Violence 
Act'' today by a strong bipartisan vote. We must continue to build a 
culture of life in our country, a compassionate society in which every 
child is born into a loving family and protected by law.
    Pregnant women who have been harmed by violence, and their families, 
know that there are two victims--the mother and the unborn child--and 
both victims should be protected by Federal law.
    I urge the Senate to pass this bill so that I can sign it into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 1997.
