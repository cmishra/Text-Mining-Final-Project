Statement on Strengthening Social Security
September 26, 1998

    The Republican tax plan drains billions of dollars from the surplus 
before we have done the hard work of strengthening Social Security. 
First things first. I will insist that we reserve the entire surplus 
until we have seized this historic opportunity to save Social Security, 
and veto any bill that doesn't meet that principle. While it is 
regrettable that this plan survived today, I am heartened by the strong 
commitment to fiscal discipline and Social Security shown by those who 
opposed it.
