Message on the Observance of Rosh Hashanah, 5766
September 30, 2005

    I send greetings to all those observing Rosh Hashanah.
    On this holy occasion, Jews around the world are called by the sound 
of the Shofar to gather in celebration of the beginning of the New Year 
and the creation of all life. For the Jewish people, this marks the 
beginning of the Days of Awe, a special time to reflect on the past year 
and welcome the year to come.
    It is also a time to reflect on the history of the Jewish people, 
from the days of Abraham to the present, and remember God's faithfulness 
to them. This year, we mark the completion of an especially joyous 
occasion, the 350th year of Jewish life in America. Throughout America's 
history, Jewish Americans have strengthened and enriched the character 
of our Nation.

                                                          George W. Bush
