Remarks Following a Meeting With NCAA Football Head Coaches
May 26, 2008

    The President. I just<Tuberville, Tommy<ls-thn-eq> welcomed<Richt, 
Mark<ls-thn-eq> five<Shannon, Randy<ls-thn-eq> of<Weis, 
Charlie<ls-thn-eq> our<Siedlecki, Jack<ls-thn-eq> Nation's university 
coaches to the Oval Office to thank them for going overseas to boost the 
morale of our troops. It was very interesting listening to them. Charlie 
Weis is going to say a few comments about what they saw and heard. But I 
wanted them to know how much I appreciate--and the--of going to say to 
these young men and women, ``Thanks for what you're doing.''
    This is Memorial Day. It's a day to honor not only those who have 
died in combat, but it's to honor those who continue to serve. 
And<Tuberville, Tommy<ls-thn-eq> these<Richt, Mark<ls-thn-eq> 
men<Shannon, Randy<ls-thn-eq> make<Weis, Charlie<ls-thn-eq> a<Siedlecki, 
Jack<ls-thn-eq> living motivating young men on the football field, and I 
am absolutely confident that when our soldiers and sailors and marine 
and airmen and Coast Guard men and women met them, that they inspired 
them.
    And most importantly, I'm confident what they heard was America 
appreciates what they do. We can't thank our troops enough for the 
sacrifices they're making on behalf of the Nation. And so I want to--I'm 
so grateful for you all for going, and I'm really grateful that you 
expressed the gratitude of the American people.
    Now, Charlie,<Weis, Charlie<ls-thn-eq> you may want to say a few 
things.
    Charlie Weis.<Weis, Charlie<ls-thn-eq> Thank you, Mr. President.
    The President. Notre Dame man.
    Mr. Weis.<Weis, Charlie<ls-thn-eq> I think that Mr. President 
definitely had the inspired part right, but that inspire part definitely 
worked both ways. Now, we went over there to help motivate the morale of 
the troops, but I think we came home probably more inspired than even 
they were. I mean, it was just an unbelievable experience to watch the 
enthusiasm and the pride and the teamwork over there.
    And I mean, I can't--we saw thousands and thousands of troops, and 
when they heard that we were coming to the White House on Monday, to a 
man and to a woman, almost everyone said, ``Could you just pass on one 
message to the President,'' and asked us to thank him for them--for him 
supporting them. I mean, think about it. They're there for 4 months, 6 
months, a year--it was just unbelievable--from Germany, you watch--you 
know, seeing guys and girls that had gotten injured in battle and the--
you know, their framework, their psyche--it was just an unbelievable 
experience.
    And I think all five of us said we just wish we could have brought 
our players over there, you know, the 18-to-23-year-olds that we deal 
with, so they could see what maturity looks like at a young age and 
teamwork at its utmost. And I tell you what, on behalf of all five 
coaches--I can tell--it was just an invigorating experience, one that 
we'll always treasure the rest of our lives.
    And we got something special going on over there, because there 
wasn't one person, of the thousands and thousands of soldiers we met, 
that had one negative thing to say. And that's almost overwhelming to 
think about it--not one. And there were a couple at the end of their 
year tours that were very much looking forward to getting their call to 
go home. But I'll tell you what, it was great. And what a perfect way to 
end up our trip, to end up at the White House on Memorial Day.
    Thank you.
    The President. Thank you very much. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 1:17 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. Participating in the meeting were Tommy Tuberville, head coach, 
Auburn University
