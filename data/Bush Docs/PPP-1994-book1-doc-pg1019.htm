Letter to Congressional Leaders on Most-Favored-Nation Trade Status for 
Former Eastern Bloc States
June 2, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Pursuant to subsection 402(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended, 19 U.S.C. 2432(d)(1) (``the Act''), I hereby submit the 
attached report concerning the continuation of a waiver of application 
of subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act. This document 
constitutes my recommendation to continue in effect this waiver 
authority for a further 12-month period, and includes my reasons for 
determining that continuation of the waiver authority and waivers 
currently in effect for Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Mongolia, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402 of the Act.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
The related memorandum is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
