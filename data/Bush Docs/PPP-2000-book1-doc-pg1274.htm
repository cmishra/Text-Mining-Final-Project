Statement on the Northern Ireland Peace Process
June 26, 2000

    The Northern Ireland peace process has been given a tremendous boost 
forward by the announcement that Martti Ahtisaari<Ahtisaari, 
Martti<ls-thn-eq> and Cyril Ramaphosa<Ramaphosa, Cyril<ls-thn-eq> have 
inspected several IRA arms dumps and issued a positive report on their 
findings through the Independent International Commission on 
Decommissioning. The fact that the IRA has reestablished contact with 
the Commission is equally significant, representing a tangible step 
toward fulfillment of its undertaking to put arms beyond use in the 
context of full implementation of the Good Friday accord. I urge all 
paramilitary organizations and political parties to build on this 
progress. I believe all the people of Northern Ireland should take heart 
from these harbingers of lasting peace.

 Note: The statement referred to former Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari, chairman, and former African National Congress Secretary-
General Cyril Ramaphosa, board member, International Crisis Group.
