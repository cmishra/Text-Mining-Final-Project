Statement on the Earthquake in Greece
September 8, 1999

    On behalf of all Americans, Hillary and I extend our profound 
sympathy to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives and to 
those injured in yesterday's earthquake in Greece. Last month people 
around the world were moved by Greece's generous assistance to Turkey in 
the wake of the devastating earthquake that struck near Istanbul. Now we 
have seen the same spirit of cooperation in President Demirel's<Demirel, 
Suleyman> pledge of support for the Greek people in their hour 
of need. We, too, are prepared to help the Greek Government respond to 
the disaster.
