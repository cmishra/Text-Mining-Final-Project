Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks
August 28, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent to the 
Federal Register the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency 
declared with respect to the terrorist attacks on the United States of 
September 11, 2001, is to continue in effect for an additional year.
    The terrorist threat that led to the declaration on September 14, 
2001, of a national emergency continues. For this reason, I have 
determined that it is necessary to continue in effect after September 
14,

2008, the national emergency with respect to the terrorist threat.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. The 
notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
