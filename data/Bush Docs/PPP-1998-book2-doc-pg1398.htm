Statement on the Fifth Anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act
August 5, 1998

    Five years ago today, the Family and Medical Leave Act went into 
effect, giving tens of millions of Americans the peace of mind that they 
would never have to choose between the jobs they need and the families 
they love. I am very proud that the Family and Medical Leave Act was the 
very first piece of legislation I signed into law.
    Millions of Americans have benefited from this historic legislation 
by taking time off--without fear of losing their jobs--to care for a 
newborn or adopted child, to attend to their own serious health needs, 
or to care for a seriously ill parent, child, or spouse. In addition, a 
report issued today by the Department of Labor shows the relative ease 
with which the law has been implemented; the overwhelming majority of 
employers have found the FMLA easy to administer, and 9 out of 10 
complaints have been successfully resolved, often with a simple phone 
call.
    I have always believed that we can help our workers fulfill their 
family responsibilities and strengthen the economy and America's 
businesses. For 5 years, the Family and Medical Leave Act has helped us 
to fulfill both of those critical goals.

Note: The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, Public Law 103-3, was 
approved February 5, 1993.
