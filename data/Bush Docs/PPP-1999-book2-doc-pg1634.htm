Remarks at the Arts and Humanities Awards Dinner
September 29, 1999

    The President. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House. A 
special welcome to all of our honorees of the National Medals of Arts 
and Humanities. The nice thing about this evening, apart from being here 
in America's house slightly before we celebrate its 200th birthday, is 
that there are no speeches and lots of entertainment--[laughter]--
unless, of course, Mr. Keillor<Keillor, Garrison> wants to 
substitute for me at this moment. [Laughter] I'll be living down that 
crack I made about him for the rest of my life. [Laughter]
    I want to say again, as I did today and as Hillary did, that this is 
one of the most enjoyable and important days of every year to us, 
because it gives America a chance to recognize our sons and daughters 
who have enriched our lives, made us laugh, made us think, made us cry, 
lifted us up when we were down. In so many ways, all of you have touched 
so many people that you will never know. But in all of them accumulated, 
you have made America a better place; you've made the world a finer 
place.
    And as we look to the new century, I hope that as time goes on we 
will be known more and more for things beyond our wealth and power, that 
go to the wealth and power of our spirit. Insofar as that happens, it 
will be because of you and people like you. And it was a privilege for 
all of us to honor you today.
    I would like to ask all of you here to join me in a toast to the 
1999 winners of the Medal of Arts and the Medal of Humanities.

[At this point, the participants drank a toast.]

    The President. And welcome. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:40 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to National Humanities Medal 
recipient humorist Garrison Keillor.
