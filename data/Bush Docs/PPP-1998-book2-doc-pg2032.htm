Statement on Signing the Centennial of Flight Commemoration Act
November 13, 1998

    Today I have signed into law S. 1397, the ``Centennial of Flight 
Commemoration Act.''
    On December 17, 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright completed the first 
successful manned flight of a heavier-than-air machine. This historic 
moment marked the first step in a long journey through the skies that 
would ultimately take Americans beyond Earth's atmosphere and into 
space. This Act establishes a commission to coordinate the commemoration 
of this achievement, the benefits of which we are continuing to reap.
    I am advised by the Department of Justice that section 9 of S. 1397, 
which authorizes the commission to devise a logo and regulate and 
license its use, is inconsistent with the Appointments Clause of the 
Constitution and that, accordingly, these functions may not be performed 
by the commission as it is currently organized. Similarly, although 
section 5(a)(3) directs the commission to ``plan and develop'' its own 
commemorative activities, the commission may not itself implement such 
activities because of Appointments Clause concerns. Finally, I also 
understand that the statute poses potential conflicts of interest 
problems. In contracting and in selecting an executive staff director 
and staff members (who will be considered Federal employees), the 
commission will need to take appropriate actions to avoid such 
conflicts. My Administration will work closely with the Congress to 
address these issues in future legislation.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

November 13, 1998.

Note: S. 1397, approved November 13, was assigned Public Law No. 105-
389.
