Statement on the Death of Representative Jo Ann Davis<Davis, Jo 
Ann<ls-thn-eq>
October 6, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened that 
Representative Jo Ann Davis lost her courageous battle with breast 
cancer today. Her determination to fight the disease is an inspiration 
to all of us.
    Over the course of her four terms in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, she was an effective advocate for the people of her 
district and a strong supporter of our men and women in uniform. She was 
a fine example of a public servant who worked hard to cut Government 
waste to ensure the people's money was used wisely. Her commonsense 
values will be missed on Capitol Hill.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our thoughts and prayers to 
her husband Chuck,<Davis, Chuck<ls-thn-eq> their two<Davis, 
Christopher<ls-thn-eq> sons,<Davis, Charles<ls-thn-eq> and the rest of 
the Davis family during this difficult time.
