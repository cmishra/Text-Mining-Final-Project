Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Bipartisan Congressional Leaders
January 31, 2001

    Thank you all for coming. This is part of our effort to get to know 
each other. And if Thomas<Thomas, William M.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Grassley<Grassley, Charles<ls-thn-eq> keep coming up here, we're going 
to get to know them too good, aren't we? [Laughter]
     I appreciate the Members of the Congress for being here this 
morning. Thank you all for coming. We're going to have a good, wide-
ranging discussion, hopefully focused on tax relief. I'm pleased to see 
the CBO members. I think it helps further the case that there is enough 
money to pay down debt, to meet priorities, and to give some of the 
money back to the people who pay the bills--that's the taxpayers.

Pan Am 103 Trial Verdict

    I also appreciate so very much the Scottish court has made a 
decision and convicted a member of the Libyan intelligence service for 
the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103. I appreciate the work of the United 
States Government team which contributed to this guilty verdict.
    Nothing can change the suffering and loss of this terrible act, but 
I hope the families do find some solace that a guilty verdict was 
rendered. I want to assure the families and victims the United States 
Government will continue to pressure Libya to accept responsibility for 
this act and to compensate the families.
    Thank you all for coming.
