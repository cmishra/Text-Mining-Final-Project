Remarks on the Negotiated Agreement To End the Northwest Airlines 
Pilots' Strike
September 10, 1998

    Good evening. I wanted to take this opportunity to say how delighted 
I am that Northwest Airlines and its pilots have reached the terms that 
form the basis of an agreement. The parties are now working on the 
specific time of getting back to work. The agreement, of course, will 
have to be approved, but I think this strike is over.
    Earlier today, I spoke over the phone to the leaders of both 
parties: Randy Babbitt of the Air Line Pilots Association; and John 
Dasburg, the CEO of Northwest Airlines. I told them how important this 
negotiated agreement is to our country and to our economy, particularly 
at this time.
    I'm pleased that they have worked so hard to make this happen. 
Getting Northwest planes and pilots back into the air is a victory for 
the company and for the employees and a victory for all Americans who 
rely on the airline.
    I'd like to say a special word of appreciation to those here in the 
administration who were involved in this effort: to Secretary Slater; to 
my Deputy White House Counsel, Bruce Lindsey, who has developed quite an 
expertise in this whole area. They both went to Minnesota this week at 
my request to help to resolve the matter. I'd also like to say a special 
word of thanks to my labor adviser here in the White House, Karen 
Tramontano, for her work. All of them helped to spur these talks along. 
They deserve credit for their determination.
    Again, let me say that this is good news for the American people. 
This is an indication that the collective bargaining process, if entered 
into in good faith, can actually work in a way that benefits everyone. I 
know there are a lot of people that depend upon Northwest who are 
relieved tonight, and again, I just want to thank all the parties, 
including you, Mr. Secretary.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 6:53 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House, prior to his departure for the Mayflower Hotel. In his remarks, 
he referred to Randall J. Babbitt, president, Air Line Pilots 
Association International, and John H. Dasburg, president and chief 
executive officer, Northwest Airlines.
