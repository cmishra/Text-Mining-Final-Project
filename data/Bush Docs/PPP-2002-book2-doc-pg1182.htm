Statement on the Death of General Benjamin Oliver Davis, Jr.<Davis, 
Benjamin O., Jr.<ls-thn-eq>
July 6, 2002

    Two days ago, on July 4th, America lost a true hero when General 
Benjamin Oliver Davis, Jr., died at Walter Reed Medical Center in 
Washington, DC. Throughout his career, General Davis served the cause of 
freedom with distinction and dignity. He will be sorely missed. On 
behalf of a grateful nation, Laura and I send our condolences to the 
Davis family.
    We will remember General Davis most for his leadership of the 
legendary Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. The segregated African 
American 332d Fighter Group flew more than 15,000 sorties against the 
Nazi Luftwaffe, destroyed over 250 enemy aircraft, and never lost a 
single Allied plane flying under its escort protection. Davis' 
leadership and the dazzling success of his Tuskegee Airmen contributed 
greatly to the victory over fascism abroad--and to important victories 
over discrimination here at home, especially the desegregation of the 
armed services ordered by President Truman in 1948.
    The quiet courage, discipline, and high achievement of the Tuskegee 
Airmen simply mirrored the qualities that Benjamin Davis, Jr., 
demonstrated throughout his career. A graduate of West Point, he was a 
recipient of the Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Cross and was the 
first African American in the Air Force to earn a star. He retired with 
the rank of Lieutenant General and was awarded his fourth star after his 
retirement in 1998. His passing on the date of our Nation's Independence 
underscores the independence and pride with which he served our Nation's 
highest ideals. General Davis left our country better than he found it 
and his legacy will endure for as long as Americans seek to protect--and 
perfect--our Union.
