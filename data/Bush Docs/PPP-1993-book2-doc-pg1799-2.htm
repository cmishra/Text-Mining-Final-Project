Statement on Signing the Departments of Labor, Health and Human 
Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994
October 21, 1993

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2518, the ``Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 
1994.''
    This Act provides funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Education, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, 
and several smaller agencies. Programs within these agencies address the 
training and employment needs of our Nation's work force, the Federal 
role in our education system, and fundamental elements of our health 
care network.
    This Act provides funding for a number of my high-priority 
investment proposals within the Departments of Labor, Health and Human 
Services (HHS), and Education. These include the Head Start program, 
Goals 2000 program, School-to-Work program, Immunization grants, and the 
National Institutes of Health.
    The Act provides funding for investment initiatives for automation 
and disability processing within the Social Security Administration 
(SSA). This will help SSA improve the quality of service to millions of 
Americans.
    I am pleased that the Act provides a large increase in funding for 
programs authorized under the Ryan White CARE Act. Programs authorized 
under this Act represent major steps forward in the battle against the 
AIDS epidemic.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
October 21, 1993.

Note: H.R. 2518, approved October 21, was assigned Public Law No. 103-
112. This statement was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
October 22.
