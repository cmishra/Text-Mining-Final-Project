Nomination for Posts at the State, Transportation, and Labor Departments
May 17, 1993

    The President named four new members of his administration today, 
announcing his intention to nominate Richard Moose to be Under Secretary 
of State for Management, Gordon Linton to be Administrator of the 
Federal Transit Administration, Louise Stoll to be Assistant Secretary 
of Transportation for Budget and Programs, and Anne Lewis to be 
Assistant Secretary of Labor for Public Affairs.
    ``This is a first-rate group of people,'' said the President. 
``Richard Moose brings significant experience in both foreign affairs 
and corporate management to the task of making the State Department work 
more efficiently. Gordon Linton is a distinguished public servant with 
an unquestionable knowledge of transportation matters. Louise Stoll has 
been a leader in both the private and public sectors in managing large 
endeavors. Anne Lewis has a tremendous sense of the concerns of working 
Americans. I am honored that all four of them will be joining my 
administration.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
