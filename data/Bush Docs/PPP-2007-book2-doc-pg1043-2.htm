Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Intelligence Reform 
Legislation
August 4, 2007

    Tonight the House joined the Senate in passing legislation that will 
close a critical gap in our intelligence collection, and I appreciate 
their efforts to complete the legislation before the August recess. The 
Director of National Intelligence,<McConnell, J. Michael<ls-thn-eq> Mike 
McConnell, has assured me that this bill gives him what he needs to 
continue to protect the country, and therefore, I will sign this 
legislation as soon as it gets to my desk.
    I also want to remind Congress that our work on reforming the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is not complete. When Congress 
returns in September, we need to work together on additional reforms, 
including the important issue of providing

meaningful liability protection to those who are alleged to have 
assisted our Nation following the attacks of September 11, 2001.

Note: The statement referred to S. 1927.
