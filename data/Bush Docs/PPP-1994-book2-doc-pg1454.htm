Statement on Most-Favored-Nation Trade Status for China
August 9, 1994

    I am committed to pursuing a sensible policy towards China that 
vigorously promotes the full range of U.S. interests in China, including 
improved human rights. We look forward to working with Congress toward 
these ends in the future.

Note: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary 
on House of Representatives action to continue most-favored-nation trade 
status for China.
