Exchange With Reporters in Dakar, Senegal
July 8, 2003

Liberia

    Q. Can we ask you about Liberia, sir?
    The President. We had a good discussion about Liberia.
    Q. Have you made a decision?
    The President. The President of Ghana<Kufuor, John 
Agyekum<ls-thn-eq> is the leader of ECOWAS. I told him we'd participate 
with ECOWAS. We're now in the process to determine the extent of our 
participation. And I really appreciate the President's leadership on 
this issue. Charles Taylor<Taylor, Charles<ls-thn-eq> must leave. The 
United Nations is going to be involved. The United States will work with 
ECOWAS. The leaders of ECOWAS were at the table, all of whom are 
concerned about Liberia, as are we, and are concerned about a peaceful 
western Africa.
    Q. Does that mean you'll send troops?
    The President. We're in the process of determining what is necessary 
to maintain the cease-fire and to allow for a peaceful transfer of 
power. We're working very closely with ECOWAS. The President of ECOWAS 
is with us today, the President of Ghana.<Kufuor, John 
Agyekum<ls-thn-eq> He and I had a good discussion. I assured him we'll 
participate in the process. And we're now in the process of determining 
what that means.
    Q. Do you have to wait until Mr. Taylor is gone?
    The President. We're in the process of determining what that means.

Note: The exchange began at 9:48 a.m. at the Presidential Palace. In his 
remarks, the President referred to President John Agyekum Kufuor of 
Ghana; and President Charles Taylor of Liberia. A tape was not available 
for verification of the content of this exchange.
