Statement on Senate Confirmation of Edward T. Schafer<Schafer, Edward 
T.<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of Agriculture
January 28, 2008

    I appreciate that the Senate today unanimously confirmed Ed Schafer 
to be our next Secretary of Agriculture. As a two-term Governor and 
business leader, Ed has distinguished himself as an executive with a 
proven record of results.
    Ed will lead a department that oversees our food, agriculture, 
natural resources, food safety, and health and nutrition programs. He 
will be an advocate for farmers, ranchers, and consumers as he works to 
open new markets for their products. And he will work with the Congress 
to pass a responsible farm bill that will provide a safety net for 
farmers and protect our lands and the environment while at the same time 
ensuring Federal tax dollars are spent wisely.
    I look forward to seeing Ed take his seat along with the rest of my 
Cabinet at this evening's State of the Union.
