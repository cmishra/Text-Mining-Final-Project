Memorandum on Humanitarian Relief for Kosovar Refugees
April 21, 1999

Memorandum for All Federal Government Employees

Subject: Humanitarian Relief for Kosovar Refugees

    As you are no doubt aware, Slobodan Milosevic's<Milosevic, 
Slobodan> ethnic cleansing of Kosovo has resulted in a grave 
humanitarian disaster, the displacement of almost 1.4 million Kosovar 
Albanians, and the slaughter of thousands. The refugees now in Macedonia 
and Albania, and those who continue to arrive each day, are in urgent 
need of food, shelter, and clothing. Relief organizations are working 
around the clock to provide this assistance, but these organizations and 
the refugees they serve need support from all of us.
    I have heard from many Federal employees who want to know what they 
can do to help in this time of crisis. We can best help alleviate the 
suffering in the Balkans by providing financial support to relief 
agencies on the front lines. The Federal Government has established a 
toll-free telephone hotline, 1-800-USAID-RELIEF,

that you may call to be referred to a number of private humanitarian 
organizations that are providing vital relief. The organizations are 
also located on the USAID Internet website, www.info.usaid.gov, under 
the listing for Kosovo. The organizations are on site, they know how to 
deliver the relief, and they need financial support.
    Together we can provide the humanitarian assistance that the people 
so urgently need, while we work with our NATO allies to create the 
conditions that will allow them to return safely to their homes and 
rebuild their lives.

                                                      William J. Clinton
