Statement on the Creation of the Department of Defense Unified Combatant 
Command for Africa
February 6, 2007

    Today I am pleased to announce my decision to create a Department of 
Defense Unified Combatant Command for Africa. I have directed the 
Secretary of Defense<Gates, Robert M.<ls-thn-eq> to stand up U.S. Africa 
Command by the end of fiscal year 2008.
    This new command will strengthen our security cooperation with 
Africa and create new opportunities to bolster the capabilities of our 
partners in Africa. Africa Command will enhance our efforts to bring 
peace and security to the people of Africa and promote our common goals 
of development, health, education, democracy, and economic growth in 
Africa.
    We will be consulting with African leaders to seek their thoughts on 
how Africa Command can respond to security challenges and opportunities 
in Africa. We will also work closely with our African partners to 
determine an appropriate location for the new command in Africa.

Note: The statement referred to Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates.
