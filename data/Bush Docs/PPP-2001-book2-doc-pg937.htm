Remarks on Patients' Bill of Rights Legislation
August 1, 2001

    The President. Today I'm very pleased to announce that Congressman 
Norwood<Norwood, Charlie> and I have reached an agreement on 
how to get a Patients' Bill of Rights out of the House of 
Representatives.
    Charlie<Norwood, Charlie> started on this issue 6 years 
ago. He's worked diligently to protect Americans, patients, from 
wrongdoings. I appreciate so very much his spirit, because I share the 
same concerns. And now after long hard labors, we've reached an 
agreement on how to amend his bill, that will meet the principles that I 
outlined.
    When I first came to Washington, I gave--right after I came to 
Washington, I gave a speech that talked about the principles necessary 
for a Patients' Bill of Rights. In that speech, I wanted a bill--a bill 
that was good for patients, a bill that allowed for people to be able to 
air their grievances, a bill that did not encourage frivolous lawsuits.
    Charlie<Norwood, Charlie> also shares the deep concern--
I'll let him express his own concerns, but there's no question that he, 
himself, wanted to get a bill. He was practicing the art of what is 
possible. It's a spirit we need more of in Washington, people who come 
to this city with the intent of doing what's right, the intent of having 
accomplishment,

the intent of not playing--you know, bickering over politics and getting 
intransigence because you don't get everything you want.
    And so after a lot of labor and a lot of hard work and a lot of 
discussion, we shook hands in the Oval Office about 10 minutes ago. And 
Charlie<Norwood, Charlie> is going to head up to the Hill. 
I've spoken to the Speaker.<Hastert, J. Dennis> And he's going 
to take--we're going to work on the language of the agreed-upon 
amendment. And it'll give the Members something positive to vote for.
    I want to thank Charlie Norwood<Norwood, Charlie> for his 
hard work, for his--the southern gentleman that he is--for his 
willingness to work with the White House. It's a good signal for a lot 
of folks in Capitol Hill.
    Now, Mr. Norwood.<Norwood, Charlie>

[At this point, Representative Charlie Norwood<Norwood, 
Charlie> made brief remarks.]

    The President. Get to work up there on the Hill, Charlie.<Norwood, 
Charlie> Thank you very much. I appreciate--[inaudible].
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 5:40 p.m. in the James S. Brady Briefing 
Room at the White House. The transcript released by the Office of the 
Press Secretary also included the remarks of Representative Norwood.
