Nomination for Posts at the Department of Labor
June 25, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate economists 
Bernard Anderson and Katharine Abraham to positions at the Department of 
Labor. If confirmed, Anderson will serve as Assistant Secretary for the 
Employment Standards Administration, and Abraham will serve as 
Commissioner of Labor Statistics.
    ``Applying adequate enforcement standards and tracking the well-
being of our Nation's work force are two of the Labor Department's most 
important responsibilities,'' said the President. ``Bernard Anderson and 
Katharine Abraham will fulfill them with rigor and integrity.''
