Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Cairo
October 26, 1994

Middle East Peace Process

    Q. What's your message for Chairman Arafat this morning, Mr. 
President?
    The President. Well, first of all, I'm delighted to start this trip 
with President Mubarak. After all, Egypt has been the leader in the 
peace process all the way and has set a standard for many years now and 
has helped all the parties, including the United States, to pursue this 
peace process.
    I'm looking forward to having a chance to talk with the President. 
And then we're going to talk with Chairman Arafat about what we can do 
to keep the process going and the importance of condemning terrorism and 
working together to go forward.
    Q. Do you have any ideas on the subject?
    The President. A few. We'll be talking about it.
    Have you been to sleep, Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press 
International]? Have you all had any sleep?
    Q. No.

Note: The exchange began at 8 a.m. at El-Qubbeh Palace. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of this exchange.
