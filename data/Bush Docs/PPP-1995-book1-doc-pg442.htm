Statement on the Major League Baseball Strike Settlement
April 2, 1995

    Today's decision is good news for the game of baseball, its fans, 
and the local economics of the cities where baseball is played.
    While I am heartened to know this season will start with major 
league players, there are a number of underlying issues which still need 
to get resolved. I strongly urge the owners and players to meet and 
reach full agreement at the bargaining table so that another season 
won't be in jeopardy.
