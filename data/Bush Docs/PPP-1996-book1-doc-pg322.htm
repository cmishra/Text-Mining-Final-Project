To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report three new deferrals and one revised 
deferral, totaling $3.6 billion, and four rescission proposals of 
budgetary resources, totaling $140 million.
    These deferrals affect the International Security Assistance 
programs as well as programs of the Agency for International 
Development. The rescission proposals affect the Department of Defense.
