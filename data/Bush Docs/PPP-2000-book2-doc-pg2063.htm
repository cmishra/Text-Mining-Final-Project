Statement on the Death of Representative Sidney R. Yates<Yates, Sidney 
R.>
October 6, 2000

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of 
Congressman Sidney Yates.
    From his 2 years in the Navy during World War II to his more than 
four decades representing the people of Chicago and the North Shore in 
Congress, Sid Yates was always a fighter--for his district, for the 
environment, and most notably, for the arts. He once said, ``I've always 
wanted Washington to be the artistic capital of the country as well as 
the political capital.'' To that end he succeeded in getting Congress 
time and time again to finance the National Endowment for the Arts. In 
appreciation, Congressman Yates was honored in 1998 by the National 
Symphony Orchestra at a performance at the Kennedy Center. No public 
official battled harder or more successfully to support our Nation's 
cultural and artistic life than Sid Yates. In recognition of that 
effort, I had the pleasure of presenting him in 1993 with the 
Presidential Citizens Medal. After retiring from the House, he continued 
serving the public as a member of the council of the U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum. Everyone who knew Sid will miss his warmth, urbanity, 
and dedication to his country.
    Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Addie,<Yates, 
Adeline> and to his family and friends.
