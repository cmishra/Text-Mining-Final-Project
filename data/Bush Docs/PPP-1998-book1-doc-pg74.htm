Statement on the Appointment of Senator John B. Breaux<Breaux, John 
B.<ls-thn-eq> as Chairman of the National Bipartisan Commission on the 
Future of Medicare
January 16, 1998

    I am pleased to join with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott<Lott, 
Trent<ls-thn-eq> and House Speaker Newt Gingrich<Gingrich, 
Newt<ls-thn-eq> in announcing the appointment of Senator John Breaux (D-
LA) as Chairman of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of 
Medicare.
    In addition, I am grateful that Representative Bill Thomas (R-
CA)<Thomas, William M.<ls-thn-eq> has agreed to become Administrative 
Chair, working with the Chairman on this important Commission.
    Over the past 5 years, we have strengthened and modernized the 
Medicare system by providing Americans with more choice and preventative 
care, reducing fraud and waste within the system, and extending the life 
of the Trust Fund for more than a decade.
    Despite these advances, there is more work to do to ensure that 
Medicare stays strong and solvent for the generations to come.
    I look forward to working with the Commission and to receiving their 
analysis of and recommendations for the future challenges facing the 
Medicare program.
