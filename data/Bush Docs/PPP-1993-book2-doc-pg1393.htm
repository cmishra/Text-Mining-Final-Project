Memorandum on the Combined Federal Campaign
August 19, 1993

Memorandum for Heads of Departments and Agencies

    The Combined Federal Campaign is an avenue through which thousands 
of Federal employees voluntarily express their concern for others each 
year. Public servants working in nearly every corner of the globe not 
only contribute to the campaign but assume leadership roles to assure 
that the campaign is a huge success.
    I am delighted to inform you that Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. 
Brown has agreed to serve as the chair of the 1993 Combined Federal 
Campaign of the National Capital Area. I ask you to support Secretary 
Brown by personally chairing the campaign in your agency and appointing 
a top official as your vice chairman.
    Your commitment and visible support will help to guarantee another 
successful campaign this year. Together, we must do everything we can to 
encourage Federal employees everywhere to do their part by participating 
in the 1993 Combined Federal Campaign.

                                                      William J. Clinton
