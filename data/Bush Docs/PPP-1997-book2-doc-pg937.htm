Message to the Senate Transmitting the Poland-United States
Extradition Treaty With Documentation
July 9, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the 
United States of America and the Republic of Poland, signed at 
Washington on July 10, 1996.
    In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
    This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between 
the law enforcement communities of both countries. It will thereby make 
a significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 9, 1997.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
July 10.
