Albania

    One of the exciting moments for our trip to Albania is to meet with 
small-business owners. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I thank the 
mayor.<Mavriqi, Ismet<ls-thn-eq> We thank the owner of the restaurant, 
and we thank these entrepreneurs for joining us to talk about your 
story, about your dreams, and about the opportunities a microloan 
program, provided by the taxpayers of the United States, is giving you 
to create jobs.
    And so we're excited to be here. Thank you for coming. And we're 
looking forward to hearing your stories.
