Statement on the Death of McGeorge Bundy
September 16, 1996

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of former National 
Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy. During a career that joined public 
service and scholarship, McGeorge Bundy was a central figure in the 
postwar history of our Nation. He served Presidents Kennedy and Johnson 
with great distinction through difficult times, including the Cuban 
missile crisis and the early days of the war in Vietnam. After leaving 
Government, he continued to dedicate himself to strengthening our Nation 
through his long stewardship of the Ford Foundation. In books and 
articles published over five decades, McGeorge Bundy brought a 
compelling intelligence to some of the most important issues of our 
times--foremost among them, reducing the danger of nuclear weapons. At 
this time of sorrow, our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and 
friends.
