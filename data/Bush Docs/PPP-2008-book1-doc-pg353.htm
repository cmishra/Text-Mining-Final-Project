Statement on the Resignation of Admiral William J. ``Fox'' 
Fallon<Fallon, William J. ``Fox''<ls-thn-eq> as Commander of United 
States Central Command
March 11, 2008

    Admiral William Fallon has served our Nation with great distinction 
for 40 years. He is an outstanding sailor, and he made history as the 
first naval officer to serve as commander of Central Command.

    From the Horn of Africa to the streets of Baghdad to the mountains 
of Afghanistan, the soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and 
coastguardsmen of Central Command are vital to the global war on terror. 
During his tenure at CENTCOM, Admiral Fallon's job has been to help 
ensure that America's military forces are ready to meet the threats

  

of an often troubled region of the world, and he deserves considerable 
credit for progress that has been made there, especially in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

    With service in Vietnam and as Vice Chief of Naval Operations, 
commander of Pacific Command, and many other positions, Admiral Fallon 
has served this country with honor, determination, and commitment. I 
thank his wife Mary,<Fallon, Mary<ls-thn-eq> who knows that military 
service involves the whole family, and I wish them all the best as they 
begin the next chapter in their lives.
