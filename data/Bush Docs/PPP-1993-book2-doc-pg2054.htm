    The President announced today that he has appointed Washington 
attorney Joel Klein to be Deputy Counsel to the President. The 
appointment is effective December 1, 1993.
    ``With a long and distinguished record of achievement and public 
service, Joel Klein has proven himself one of the finest lawyers in 
Washington. His wisdom has been invaluable to me on a number of 
occasions already, and I expect that he will be an important advisor to 
me as Deputy Counsel,'' said the President.
