Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Sudan
October 29, 2003

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary 
date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent the enclosed notice, 
stating the Sudan emergency is to continue in effect beyond November 3, 
2003, to the Federal Register for publication. The most recent notice 
continuing this emergency was published in the Federal Register on 
October 31, 2002 (67 Fed. Reg. 66525).
    The crisis between the United States and Sudan constituted by the 
actions and policies of the Government of Sudan that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on November 3, 1997, has not been 
resolved. These actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests and 
pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, I have 
determined it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared 
with respect to Sudan and maintain in force the comprehensive sanctions 
against Sudan to respond to this threat.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 October 29, 2003.

Note: The notice of October 29 is listed in Appendix D at the end of 
this volume.
