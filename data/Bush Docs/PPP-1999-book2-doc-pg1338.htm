Statement on the Organization of African Unity's Framework Agreement for 
Ethiopia and Eritrea
July 27, 1999

    I welcome the announcement by the Organization of African Unity 
(OAU) that Ethiopia and Eritrea have accepted the OAU framework 
agreement and the modalities for its implementation, and agreed to steps 
proposed by the OAU to facilitate implementation of the agreement. This 
is a significant step toward peace.
    We have worked intensively with the OAU in recent weeks to help 
bring an end to this devastating conflict. My Special Envoy, Anthony 
Lake,<Lake, Anthony> has just returned from the region, where 
he met with the leaders of both governments and the OAU. The United 
States will continue to support the efforts of the OAU under the 
chairmanship of Algerian President Bouteflika<Bouteflika, 
Abdelaziz> to bring this tragic conflict to a speedy 
conclusion.
