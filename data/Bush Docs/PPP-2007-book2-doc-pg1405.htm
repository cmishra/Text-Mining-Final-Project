Remarks on the Nomination of Edward T. Schafer<Schafer, Edward 
T.<ls-thn-eq> To Be Secretary of Agriculture
October 31, 2007

    The President. Thank you all. Be seated. Good afternoon. I'm proud 
to announce my nomination of Ed Schafer to be the next Secretary of the 
Agriculture.
    The Secretary of Agriculture heads a Cabinet Department of more than 
100,000 employees. I rely on the Secretary to provide sound advice on 
issues ranging from our Nation's farm economy and food supply to 
international trade and conservation programs. To carry out these 
responsibilities, the Secretary of Agriculture needs to be someone who 
understands the challenges facing America's farmers, ranchers, and 
consumers.
    Ed Schafer is the right choice to fill this post. He was a leader on 
agricultural issues during his 8 years as the Governor of North Dakota. 
He worked to open new markets for North Dakota farmers and ranchers by 
expanding trade with China. He oversaw the development of the State's 
agricultural biofuels industry. He helped families recover from natural 
disasters, including drought, fires, and floods. And he pioneered 
innovative programs to increase economic opportunity in rural 
communities.
    Ed also has extensive management experience in the private sector. 
Before running for public office, he was the president of the family-
owned business that his dad started. He's also launched a number of 
entrepreneurial ventures on his own. At every stage of his career, Ed 
has shown wisdom, foresight, and creativity. Those same qualities will 
make him a valuable

member of my Cabinet, and they will make him a trusted friend to 
America's farmers and ranchers.
    Ed's passion for agriculture has deep roots. His maternal 
grandparents were Danish immigrants who worked as farmers on the plains 
of North Dakota. Ed has always kept their story close to his heart. And 
they'd be proud to see their grandson rise to become our Nation's top 
agriculture official.
    In his new job, Ed will carry on the work of another fine public 
servant, Mike Johanns.<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> Mike became Secretary of 
Agriculture at the beginning of my second term. During his time in 
office, he helped open new markets for trade, promoted renewable fuels 
and conservation, and provided timely assistance to our farmers and 
ranchers devastated by natural disasters. Mike leaves a legacy of 
integrity and dedication. And Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish 
Mike and his wife Stephanie<Johanns, Stephanie<ls-thn-eq> all the best 
on their return to Nebraska.
    I also thank my friend Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Chuck 
Conner<Conner, Charles F.<ls-thn-eq> for serving as Acting Secretary 
during this time of transition. Chuck grew up on a family farm in 
Indiana. He has a deep knowledge of agricultural issues. He's done an 
outstanding job. Appreciate the fact that you'll remain as Acting 
Secretary until the Senate confirms Ed as Mike Johanns's<Johanns, 
Mike<ls-thn-eq> permanent replacement. And thank you for joining us 
today.
    Following Mike<Johanns, Mike<ls-thn-eq> is not going to be easy, but 
Ed Schafer is up to the challenge. With Ed's leadership, we will work 
with Congress to pass a farm bill that provides farmers with a safety 
net, protects our lands and the environment, and spends Federal tax 
dollars wisely. Ed will also join other members of my administration to 
continue leveling the playing field for America's farm products by 
concluding the Doha round of trade negotiations. And he and I will 
continue to work hard to open up new markets for American beef.
    As Ed takes on these new challenges, he will rely on the support of 
his caring family. Ed is blessed with a wonderful wife, Nancy,<Schafer, 
Nancy Jones<ls-thn-eq> who came from North Dakota today. He is also 
blessed with<Schafer, Tom<ls-thn-eq> four<Schafer, Ellie<ls-thn-eq> 
children<Jones, Eric<ls-thn-eq> and<Jones, Kari<ls-thn-eq> eight 
grandchildren. Their love will give Ed the strength to serve our country 
in his new capacity.
    I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Ed Schafer as the 29th 
Secretary of Agriculture. I look forward to having this good and decent 
man as a member of my Cabinet. Congratulations.

[At this point, Secretary-designate Schafer made brief remarks.]

    The President. Thank you, sir. Good job.

Note: The President spoke at 2:05 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. The transcript released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary also included the remarks of Secretary-designate Schafer.
