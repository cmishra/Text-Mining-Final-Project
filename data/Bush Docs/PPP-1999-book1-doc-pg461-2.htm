Statement on the Death of Michael Aris<Aris, Michael>
March 27, 1999

    The First Lady and I were saddened to learn of the death of Dr. 
Michael Aris, a scholar of Tibetan and Himalayan Studies at Oxford 
University. We offer our sincere condolences to his wife, Aung San Suu 
Kyi,<Aung San Suu Kyi> his sons, Alexander<Aris, 
Alexander> and Kim,<Aris, Kim> and other family 
members.
    Dr. Aris' perseverance and dedication to his wife and family and to 
the cause of human rights and democracy in Burma earned him the respect 
and admiration of citizens around the world. At this difficult time, I 
want to reaffirm to Michael's family and to all the people of Burma that 
the United States will keep working for the day when all who have been 
separated and sent into exile by the denial of human rights in Burma are 
reunited with their families and when Burma is reunited with the family 
of freedom.
