Statement on the Resignation of Joe M. Allbaugh<Allbaugh, Joe 
M.<ls-thn-eq> as Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
December 16, 2002

    For nearly 2 years as Director of FEMA, Joe Allbaugh has served 
America with ability, courage, and compassion. He will continue to 
shepherd FEMA through its transition into the Department of Homeland 
Security.
    After the attacks on our country, America came to know Joe as I do: 
He is a steady leader, a calm presence, and man who inspires confidence 
in a time of crisis. I have trusted Joe in a variety of positions 
throughout my public life, and he has always met the highest standards 
of service and integrity. Laura and I wish Joe the very best in all that 
he does in the future.
