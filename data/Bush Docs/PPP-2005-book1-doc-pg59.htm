Remarks at Georgetown University's ``Let Freedom Ring'' Celebration
January 17, 2005

    Thank you all. Thanks for coming. Thanks for the invitation. 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are pleased to join you on this 
national holiday as we honor two exceptional Americans who we're proud 
to call friends.
    I want to thank Dr. DeGioia<DeGioia, John J.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Georgetown University for sponsoring the John Thompson Legacy of a Dream 
Award. I want to thank the Georgetown Gospel Choir for sharing their 
gifts at this celebration. I want to thank John Thompson<Thompson, John 
R.<ls-thn-eq> for being here and for setting such a great example. I 
appreciate the thoughtful words from one of the most recognized voices 
in America, Tom Joyner.<Joyner, Tom<ls-thn-eq> I can't wait to hear 
Aaron Neville.<Neville, Aaron<ls-thn-eq> I want to thank the Members of 
Congress, the members of my administration, and all the distinguished 
guests who are here today. I also want to thank Dr. Dorothy 
Height<Height, Dorothy I.<ls-thn-eq> for joining us this afternoon.
    Every year on this day we reflect the history of civil rights in 
America. It's a story of our Founders--among them, slaveowners--who 
declared a standard of equality and justice that would one day be used

[[Page 60]]

to put an end to slavery. It's a story of a terrible war that freed men 
and women from bondage but not from oppression and segregation. It's a 
story of generations ``not having received the promises but having seen 
them afar off.'' And it's a story of Americans like Reverend Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., who held our Nation to those promises and would not 
rest until they were written into law.
    Dr. King was a minister of the Gospel who could have had an easy 
life in a respected pulpit. Today he would be just 76 years old. 
Instead, he chose to minister in the spirit of John Wesley, who said, 
``I look upon all the world as my parish.'' The Nation first took notice 
in the 1950s and in the 1960s, when he wrote, ``I am in Birmingham 
because injustice is here.'' In the space of just a few years, through 
the power of his intellect, the truth of his words, and the example of 
his courage, he left this country a different and better place and made 
his own journey to a different and better place.
    Dr. King believed so fully in the ideals of America that he was 
offended every day that they were violated. He had studied the founding 
documents and found no exceptions to the promise of freedom. He was 
disappointed in the unfair practices of his country. Yet he said, 
``There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love.'' 
Dr. King loved America enough to confront its injustices, not 
compromising the truth and not fearing any man, and America loves him in 
return.
    Martin Luther King also knew that man's right to be free is rooted 
in something far beyond the charters of a country. He believed and he 
knew that the image of God we share is a source of our dignity as human 
beings and the basis for our equality. He believed and he knew that the 
teachings of Jesus stand in eternal judgment of oppression. He believed 
and he knew that the God who made us for freedom will bring us to 
freedom.
    By observing and honoring Dr. King's birthday, we teach the next 
generation lessons that must never be forgotten. We need our children to 
know how great the struggle for racial justice in our society has been 
and how much work remains to be done. We need them to know that the 
greatest causes sometime involve the greatest sacrifices and that 
history moves forward on the strength of those sacrifices. And we need 
the children of America to know that a single life of conscience and 
purpose can touch and lift up many lives.
    The influence of one good life is also the message of the Legacy of 
a Dream Award--in this case the influence of two good lives. 
Alma<Powell, Alma V. Johnson<ls-thn-eq> and Colin Powell<Powell, Colin 
L.<ls-thn-eq> are among the most admired people in our country. For 
these 4 years, they've also been America's representatives to the world. 
They are honorable people who bring honor to this Nation, and America is 
grateful for their example of service.
    As their friends know, Alma<Powell, Alma V. Johnson<ls-thn-eq> and 
Colin<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> met on a blind date. [Laughter] Alma 
has said she remembers the future general looking like a lost 12-year-
old. [Laughter] That's the side of the man I've never seen before. 
[Laughter] For his part, Colin has said that night he was ``mesmerized 
by a pair of luminous eyes, an unusual shade of green.'' And from that 
day to this, he has been fortunate to have this beautiful, accomplished 
woman at his side.
    Colin Powell<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> has lived his own inspiring 
story, a story of exceptional accomplishment that started before 
segregation ended. When he was a young officer, someone told him, ``You 
are the best black lieutenant I have ever known.'' He later wrote, 
``Inside me, I was thinking, if you intend to measure me only against 
black lieutenants, you are making a mistake.'' [Laughter] He went on to 
write, ``I'm going to show you the best lieutenant in the Army, 
period.''
    The best lieutenant<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> in the Army went on 
to a distinguished military career that ended with four stars on his 
shoulder. Along the way, he earned two Purple

[[Page 61]]

Hearts, the Bronze Star, the Soldier's Medal, the Legion of Merit, the 
Congressional Gold Medal, and two Presidential Medals of Freedom. I'm 
not through yet. [Laughter] I'm just getting started. [Laughter] See, 
he's been an official in the administration of six Presidents, including 
service as the National Security Adviser to President Reagan, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents Bush<Bush, George 
H.W.<ls-thn-eq> and Clinton.<Clinton, William J.<ls-thn-eq>
    More than 4 years ago, when I needed a Secretary of State,<Powell, 
Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> I knew what I was looking for. I wanted someone who 
believed deeply in the values of our country and could share them with 
the world, a person of wisdom and decency, a leader who could bring out 
the best in people. I found all this and more in Colin Powell. Our 65th 
Secretary of State became one of the most effective and admired 
diplomats in America's history. He has helped to rally the world in a 
global war and to resolve dangerous regional conflicts and to confront 
the desperate challenges of natural disaster and hunger and poverty and 
disease. He's been tireless and selfless and principled. In the work he 
and I have shared, he has become a great friend, and I appreciate all he 
has done for our wonderful country.
    His<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> proudest achievements probably have 
little to do with public service. See, he's a wonderful dad to 
Michael<Powell, Michael K.<ls-thn-eq> and Anne-Marie<Powell, Anne 
M.<ls-thn-eq> and Linda.<Powell, Linda<ls-thn-eq> Over the years, he's 
been a mentor to young people. As a founder of America's Promise, Colin 
has drawn countless others to become involved in the lives of children 
and to give them the hope and confidence they need for a successful 
life. Today we honor not just Colin Powell's lifetime of leadership, but 
we honor his great kindness and his compassion.
    The same kinds of idealism and character have marked the life of 
Alma Johnson Powell.<Powell, Alma V. Johnson<ls-thn-eq> Like her 
husband,<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> she was raised by strong and decent 
people. And Birmingham, where Martin Luther King was jailed--Birmingham, 
which--where he was jailed, was also the home of the Johnson family. 
That's where she was raised, in other words. [Laughter] Alma remembers 
her father during the worst of days sitting up at night with a shotgun 
by his side to protect his wife and his children. Mr. Johnson was a high 
school principal, and he was a legend to generations of students who 
remember his high standards and his imposing presence. His daughter, 
Alma, has always been impressive as well because of her grace and her 
principle.
    For many years, Alma<Powell, Alma V. Johnson<ls-thn-eq> served 
America as a soldier's wife, moving the household 18 times and leading 
the family when the Army--anyone who wants to know the meaning of duty 
and unselfish love can look at our military families, like the Powells. 
This good-hearted mother and grandmother shares her love with others as 
the chair of America's Promise. People here at the Kennedy Center know 
her as the leading member of the board of trustees. She's a noted author 
of several children's books and a volunteer who gives her time to help 
young people make good choices in life. Alma Powell is one of the finest 
people Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are privileged to know. And 
she is a superb choice for the Legacy of a Dream Award. I'm not kidding, 
either.
    You have chosen, on this important day for America, to pay tribute 
to a woman<Powell, Alma V. Johnson<ls-thn-eq> and a man<Powell, Colin 
L.<ls-thn-eq> who have upheld the highest ideal of American citizenship. 
In their love of country and their heart for service, they show the same 
character found in the life of Dr. Martin Luther King. Thank you for the 
privilege of joining you this afternoon and for the pleasure of being 
able to honor these fine, fine Americans.
    May God bless the<Powell, Alma V. Johnson<ls-thn-eq> 
Powells,<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> and may God continue to bless the 
United States of America.

Note: The President spoke at 4:16 p.m. at the John F. Kennedy Center for 
the Performing Arts. In his remarks, he referred to John J. DeGioia, 
president, and John Thompson, former head men's basketball coach,
