Statement on the Death of Former Representative Henry J. Hyde<Hyde, 
Henry J.<ls-thn-eq>
November 29, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of former Congressman Henry Hyde. From his service in the Navy during 
World War II until his retirement from the U.S. House of Representatives 
last year, Henry Hyde led a life devoted to public service. During more 
than 30 years as a Congressman, he represented the people of Illinois 
with character and dignity and always stood for a strong and purposeful 
America. This fine man believed in the power of freedom, and he was a 
tireless champion of the weak and forgotten. He used his talents to 
build a more hopeful America and promote a culture of life. Earlier this 
month, in recognition of his good and purposeful life, I was proud to 
award Henry Hyde the Medal of Freedom.
    Congressman Hyde's passing represents a great loss to the people of 
Illinois and our Nation, and our thoughts and prayers are with his 
family in this sad hour.
