Letter on Withdrawal of the Nomination of Robert Pastor To Be Ambassador 
to Panama
January 27, 1995

Dear Bob:
    I received with regret your request that I not resubmit your 
nomination as Ambassador to Panama to the Senate. I am certain that you 
would have served your country with great distinction and honor in that 
important post.
    Throughout your career you have made important contributions to 
American foreign policy in Latin America and the Caribbean. During your 
service on the National Security Council, you helped to fashion a human 
rights policy consistent with fundamental American values that advanced 
the cause of freedom throughout the hemisphere. At the Carter Center, 
you have continued to foster democracy and peace with great skill and 
dedication, most recently contributing to the restoration of democracy 
in Haiti.
    I applaud you for these outstanding contributions and look forward 
to your continuing advice and assistance.
        Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
January 31.
