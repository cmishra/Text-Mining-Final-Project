Statement on Senate Armed Services Committee Action on the Nomination of 
Daryl Jones To Be Secretary of the Air Force
July 22, 1998

    I am deeply disappointed that the Senate Armed Services Committee 
declined to send to the full Senate the nomination of Daryl Jones to be 
Secretary of the Air Force. Mr. Jones has a distinguished record of 
public service in Florida and a strong commitment to the Air Force. I 
know him to be a good, decent, able man. He was an outstanding candidate 
for this position, and he deserved the opportunity to be considered by 
the full Senate. I appreciate the support he received from Chairman 
Thurmond, Senator Levin, and many other Senators in both parties. I 
thank Mr. Jones for his willingness to serve his country. I am confident 
that he will continue to make vital contributions to Florida and to our 
Nation.
