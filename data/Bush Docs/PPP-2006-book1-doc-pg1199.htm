Statement on Senate Passage of Fisheries Management Legislation
June 21, 2006

    I applaud the Senate for passing a stronger Magnuson-Stevens Act by 
unanimous consent. By emphasizing the important role of ecosystem-based 
approaches to fisheries management and strengthening penalties for 
overfishing and other violations, this legislation will be vital to 
ensuring that we remain good stewards of our marine environment. I 
congratulate Chairman Stevens<Stevens, Theodore F.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Cochairman Inouye<Inouye, Daniel K.<ls-thn-eq> for their work on this 
important bipartisan bill that embraces my priorities of ending 
overfishing and rebuilding our Nation's fish stocks through more 
effective, market-based management methods.
    Since my administration released the Ocean Action Plan in 2004, we 
have been making great strides in our efforts to make our oceans, 
coasts, and lakes cleaner, healthier, and more productive. Last week, I 
established the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument, 
the largest single conservation area in the history of our country and 
the largest protected marine area in the world. Enactment of a stronger 
Magnuson-Stevens Act is one of the top priorities of the Ocean Action 
Plan, and Senate passage of this bill is an important milestone on the 
way to another significant bipartisan ocean policy achievement.
    I urge the House of Representatives to join the Senate in passing 
this important initiative.

Note: The statement referred to S. 2012.
