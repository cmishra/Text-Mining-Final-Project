Statement on the Death of Maureen Reagan<Reagan, Maureen>
August 8, 2001

    Laura and I are deeply saddened to learn of Maureen Reagan's death. 
Maureen was a devoted, caring daughter and mother. She fought tirelessly 
to increase funding for Alzheimer's research and raise public awareness 
of the disease. Our thoughts and prayers are with Maureen's husband, 
Dennis,<Revell, Dennis C.> their daughter, Rita,<Revell, 
Rita> and the entire family.
