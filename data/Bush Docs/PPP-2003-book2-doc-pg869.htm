Statement Welcoming the New Leadership of the African Union
July 12, 2003

    I congratulate President Joaquim Alberto Chissano<Chissano, Joaquim 
Alberto<ls-thn-eq> of Mozambique on his appointment as the new President 
of the African Union. I also extend congratulations to President 
Konare<Konare, Alpha Oumar<ls-thn-eq> of Mali on his appointment as the 
new Chair of the Commission of the African Union. I am confident that 
the African Union--and the people of Africa--will be well-served by the 
experience and vision these two leaders bring to these important posts.
    Africa is a place of both great potential and daunting challenges. 
The United States shares the hopes of peoples across the African 
Continent for a future of greater peace, greater freedom, and greater 
development. And America will work in partnership with all African 
nations committed to these great goals.
    The African Union has the mandate and the responsibility to respond 
effectively to Africa's challenges, including instability, terrorist 
threats, challenges to the effective rule of law, HIV/AIDS, poverty, and 
humanitarian emergencies. I look forward to the African Union continuing 
to play a vital role in shaping Africa's future under its dynamic new 
leadership.
