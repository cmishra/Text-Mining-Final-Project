Statement on the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and 
Climate
July 27, 2005

    The United States has joined with Australia, China, India, Japan, 
and South Korea to create a new Asia-Pacific partnership on clean 
development, energy security, and climate change. This new results-
oriented partnership will allow our nations to develop and accelerate 
deployment of cleaner, more efficient energy technologies to meet 
national pollution reduction, energy security, and climate change 
concerns in ways that reduce poverty and promote economic development. 
The six Asia-Pacific partners will build on our strong history of common 
approaches and demonstrated cooperation on clean energy technologies. I 
have directed Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice<Rice, 
Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> and Secretary of Energy Sam Bodman<Bodman, Samuel 
W.<ls-thn-eq> to meet with their counterparts this fall to carry forward 
our new partnership and provide direction for our joint work.
