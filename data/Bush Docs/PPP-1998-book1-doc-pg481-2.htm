Message to the Congress Reporting on Appropriations for B-2 Bombers
March 31, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 
1998, Public Law 105-56 (1997), and section 131 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, Public Law 105-85 (1997), I 
certify to the Congress that no additional B-2 bombers should be 
procured during this fiscal year.
    After considering the recommendations of the Panel to Review Long-
Range Air Power and the advice of the Secretary of Defense,<Cohen, 
William S.<ls-thn-eq> I have decided that the $331 million authorized 
and appropriated for B-2 bombers in Fiscal Year 1998 will be applied as 
follows: $174 million will be applied toward completing the planned 
Fiscal Year 1998 baseline modification and repair program and $157 
million will be applied toward further upgrades to improve the 
deployability, survivability, and maintainability of the current B-2 
fleet. Using the funds in this manner will ensure successful completion 
of the baseline modification and repair program and further enhance the 
operational combat readiness of the B-2 fleet.
    The Panel to Review Long-Range Air Power also provided several far-
reaching recommendations for fully exploiting the potential of the 
current B-1, B-2, and B-52 bomber force, and for upgrading and 
sustaining the bomber force for the longer term. These longer term 
recommendations warrant careful review as the Department of Defense 
prepares its Fiscal Year 2000-2006 Future Years Defense Program.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

March 31, 1998.
