Statement on Senate Action on Health Care Reform Legislation
July 2, 1994

    The action of the Senate Finance Committee today moves health care 
reform another step closer to final passage.
    Chairman Moynihan has worked diligently to make sure his committee 
produced a bill to debate on the Senate floor. His commitment to 
universal coverage has been clear throughout this process, and I look 
forward to his continued leadership as we move toward guaranteed health 
coverage for every American.
    I remain firmly committed to guaranteed health coverage for every 
American that can never be taken away. We must achieve universal 
coverage if we are to reform our health care system and assure hard-
working, middle class Americans that they will have health care when 
they need it. I am confident that we will achieve the goal of guaranteed 
coverage for everyone this year, and I look forward to the debate in the 
full House and Senate.
