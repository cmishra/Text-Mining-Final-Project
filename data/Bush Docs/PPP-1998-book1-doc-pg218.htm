Statement on the United States District Court Decision on the
Line Item Veto
February 12, 1998

    The line item veto provides an important tool for the President to 
strike unnecessary spending and tax items from legislation. Congress 
took the correct step giving the President this authority, and I was 
pleased to sign the line item veto into law. It has worked well, saving 
the American taxpayers more than $1 billion already. Although I am 
disappointed with today's ruling, it is my belief that, ultimately, the 
line item veto will be ruled constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.
