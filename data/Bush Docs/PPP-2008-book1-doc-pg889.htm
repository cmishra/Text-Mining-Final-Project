Statement on the United States Supreme Court Ruling on Individual Gun 
Rights
June 26, 2008

    As a longstanding advocate of the rights of gun owners in America, I 
applaud the Supreme Court's historic decision today confirming what has 
always been clear in the Constitution: The Second Amendment protects an 
individual right to keep and bear firearms.
    I also agree with the Supreme Court's conclusion that the DC firearm 
laws violate this fundamental constitutional right. The District of 
Columbia should now swiftly move to ensure that its residents' rights 
under the Second Amendment are fully protected.
