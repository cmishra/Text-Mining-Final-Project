Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Libya
January 2, 1997

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Libyan emergency is to continue in 
effect beyond January 7, 1997, to the Federal Register for publication. 
Similar notices have been sent annually to the Congress and the Federal 
Register since December 23, 1986. The most recent notice appeared in the 
Federal Register on January 3, 1996.
    The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been 
resolved. The Government of Libya has continued its actions and policies 
in support of terrorism, despite the calls by the United Nations 
Security Council, in Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993), 
that it demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of such 
terrorism. Such Libyan actions and policies pose a continuing unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign 
policy interests of the United States. For these reasons, I have 
determined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad 
authorities necessary to apply economic pressure to the Government of 
Libya to reduce its ability to support international terrorism.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
