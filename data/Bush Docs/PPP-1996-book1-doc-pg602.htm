Remarks Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister John Major of the 
United Kingdom in Moscow, Russia
April 20, 1996

Chechnya

    Q. Mr. President, did you and the Prime Minister discuss Chechnya 
and the ongoing crisis with President Yeltsin?
    The President. No, we just got here. We're just starting a 
discussion.
    Q. [Inaudible]--together, was Chechnya brought up?
    The President Chechnya was not brought up. We discussed the Middle 
East and we discussed Bosnia, because we have common efforts there. But 
the rest of our time was devoted to the nuclear summit.
    And I'm looking forward, I might say, to this meeting because of all 
the good work the Prime Minister has done for peace in Northern Ireland 
with the Irish Prime Minister. And I think that the proposal for all-
party talks and the elections as a way to get into it is a very good 
thing. And I think the cease-fire should be reestablished by the IRA 
immediately.

Middle East Peace Process

    Q. What about the Middle East, sir? Have you heard anything from 
Secretary Christopher or other people involved, any updates?
    The President I'm in regular contact with him, but I have nothing to 
add right now. We're working at it hard and we may have something to say 
in the next few hours, but I just don't know.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 10 a.m. at the Kremlin. In 
his remarks, he referred to President Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Prime 
Minister John Bruton of Ireland.
