Statement on the National Performance Review
March 3, 1994

    We are changing the way Government works. We're cutting redtape. 
We're empowering employees to get results, and we're treating each and 
every citizen as if they were our most valued customer. It's an ongoing 
commitment that this Government has made to its citizens, and it starts 
at the top.
    The National Performance Review is not another boring Government 
reform report that sits gathering dust on the shelves of the White 
House. It is the blueprint for change that's taking place right now.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement on 
reinventing Government.
