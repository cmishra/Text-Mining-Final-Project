    On behalf of the American people, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
send our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those who 
lost their lives in the devastating earthquake in Indonesia. Our 
thoughts and prayers are with the Indonesian people as they comfort all 
those affected by this terrible disaster.
    Through financial and material support, the United States is 
assisting with recovery efforts in coordination with Indonesian 
authorities, and we stand prepared to provide additional assistance as 
needed.
