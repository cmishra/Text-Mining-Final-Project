Statement on Announcing the Forest Conference
March 10, 1993

    Planning and good long-term management can help us protect jobs and 
the unique old-growth forests that are as much a part of our national 
heritage as the Grand Canyon or Yosemite. It is time to break the 
gridlock that has blocked action and bring all sides together to craft a 
balanced approach to the economic and environmental challenges we face.

Note: The President's statement was included in a White House statement 
announcing the Forest Conference scheduled for April 2 in Portland, OR.
