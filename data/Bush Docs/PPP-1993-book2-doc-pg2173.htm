Appointment for Chair of the Commission on Immigration Reform
December 14, 1993

    The President today appointed former Texas Congresswoman Barbara 
Jordan to chair the Commission on Immigration Reform. The nine-member 
Commission was created by Congress in 1990 to evaluate the impact of the 
recent changes in immigration policy and to recommend further changes 
that might be necessary by September 30, 1994, and again by September 
30, 1997.
    ``I have chosen Barbara Jordan, one of the most well respected 
people in America, to chair this Commission because immigration is one 
of the most important and complex issues facing our country today,'' 
said the President. ``I am confident that Congresswoman Jordan will use 
her prodigious talents to thoughtfully address the challenges posed by 
immigration reform, balance the variety of competing interests, and 
recommend policies that will be in our country's best interests.''

Note: A biography of the appointee was made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
