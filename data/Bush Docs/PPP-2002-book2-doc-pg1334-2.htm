Statement on Senate Action on Defense Appropriations Legislation
August 1, 2002

    I applaud the Senate for answering my call to quickly pass the 
Defense appropriations bill. With our Nation at war, it is imperative 
that we address the important priority of ensuring that our troops have 
the resources they need. I urge the House and Senate to resolve their 
differences promptly and send a bill to my desk in early September.
