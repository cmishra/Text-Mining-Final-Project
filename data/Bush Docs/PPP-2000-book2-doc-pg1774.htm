Statement on a Revision of the United Nations' Peacekeeping Costs 
Assessment Scale
September 8, 2000

    I am pleased that so many nations have announced their support for a 
revision of the United Nations' peacekeeping scale of assessment, a 
revision that will better reflect the reality of peacekeeping costs in 
the year 2000. Much will depend on the outcome of this fall's 
deliberations, including the future of U.N. peacekeeping.
    Specifically, I want to express my personal appreciation to the 
countries who have demonstrated leadership by agreeing to assume 
additional financial responsibility under the peacekeeping scale: 
Antigua and Barbuda, Bulgaria, Kuwait, Malta, Qatar, Republic of Korea, 
Romania, and Slovenia. The formula used for funding U.N. peacekeeping 
operations, the so-called scale of assessment, is long out of step with 
today's realities and is in pressing need of change.
    Yesterday all permanent five members of the Security Council 
supported a revision of the peacekeeping financial structure. My team 
and I will be working on this important issue for the remainder of this 
administration.
    The U.N. General Assembly will be debating revisions to the scale of 
assessments over the next few months. These deliberations will be guided 
and inspired by the example of the countries.
