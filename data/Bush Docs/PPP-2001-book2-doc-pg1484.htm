Statement on the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards
December 4, 2001

    I am honored to bestow the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology's Baldrige Award on businesses and schools which have set a 
standard for quality. These winners remind us that excellence in all 
organizations strengthens our Nation.
    I am especially pleased that this year's awards include the first 
Baldrige education winners. They illustrate that the quality of 
education for children can be improved with innovative programs. These 
organizations demonstrate that improving the quality of education for 
all children is everyone's business.
