Statement on Proposals To Reopen Trade in Elephant Ivory and
Whale Products
April 14, 2000

    I am deeply concerned that successful efforts by the international 
community to protect endangered species would be undermined by proposals 
to reopen trade in elephant ivory and whale products. We will oppose 
these proposals and urge other nations currently meeting in Nairobi, 
Kenya, to maintain current trade restrictions. I am proud of the fact 
that the United States has been a worldwide leader in the protection of 
elephants and whales. We will continue our work with international 
partners to protect these magnificent animals.
