Statement on the Situation in Burma
February 25, 2008

    The situation in Burma remains deplorable. The regime has rejected 
calls from its own people and the international community to begin a 
genuine dialogue with the opposition and ethnic minority groups. Arrests 
and secret trials of peaceful political activists continue, such as the 
recent arrest of journalists Thet Zin<Thet Zin<ls-thn-eq> and Sein Win 
Maung.<Sein Win Maung<ls-thn-eq> Severe human rights abuses by the 
Burmese Army, including burning down homes and killing civilians, 
continue in ethnic minority areas in eastern Burma.
    The United States continues to seek a peaceful transition to a 
democratic government that will promote stability and prosperity in 
Burma and in the region. We support continued engagement by the U.N. 
Security Council and United Nations Secretary-General Ban's<Ban Ki-
moon<ls-thn-eq> good offices mission, as well as sustained regional 
engagement.
    As one element of our policy to promote a genuine democratic 
transition, the U.S. maintains targeted sanctions that focus on the 
assets of regime members and their cronies who grow rich while Burma's 
people suffer under their misrule. Therefore, today the Department of 
the Treasury has applied financial sanctions against Steven Law,<Law, 
Steven<ls-thn-eq> a regime crony also suspected of drug trafficking 
activities, and his financial network, including his wife,<Ng, 
Cecilia<ls-thn-eq> father,<Lo Hsing Han<ls-thn-eq> and 14 companies, 
pursuant to Executive Order 13448.
    Additionally, the Department of the Treasury has applied sanctions 
to two resorts owned and operated by known regime crony and arms 
merchant Tay Za,<Tay Za<ls-thn-eq> himself designated for sanctions in 
October 2007. Today's actions add to the 33 individuals and 11 entities 
previously designated. Furthermore, as a result of the enhanced visa 
restrictions that I announced in September 2007, 898 Burmese officials 
and their family members are now subject to visa restrictions.

    Concerted international pressure is needed to achieve a genuine 
transition to democracy in Burma. We encourage Burma's neighbors and 
other stakeholders in Southeast Asia to impress upon the regime the need 
to release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi,<Aung San 
Suu Kyi<ls-thn-eq> to end military offensives and human rights abuses 
against ethnic minorities, and to begin a genuine transition to 
democracy in response to the demonstrated aspirations of all the peoples 
of Burma.

Note: The statement referred to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon of the 
United Nations; Cecilia Ng, wife, and Lo Hsing Han, father, of Steven 
Law; and Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy 
in Burma.
