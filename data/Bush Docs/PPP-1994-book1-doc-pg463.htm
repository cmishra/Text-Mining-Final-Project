Exchange With Reporters in Nashua
March 15, 1994

    Q. Does it make you angry?
    The President. No, but let me show you something. Look at this. This 
is what people care about. Here's a child with a preexisting condition. 
He can't get health insurance. So I went out there, was shaking hands in

    The President. You can draw your own conclusion about that, but you 
heard from a lot of wise people here today.
    Q. Are you angry, Mr. President? You sounded awfully angry last

    The President. I wasn't. I was happy. What I said last night, I was 
not angry, but I'm determined. That was a deliberate--I wanted to tell 
those people how I felt. And I'm very happy being here today. This is 
America; this is where they are.
    Q. It sure looks like you started the '96 campaign----
    The President. It's not about the '96 campaign; this is about what 
we're going to do in Congress for the American people in 1994. That's 
what this was about.

Note: The exchange began at approximately 11 a.m. outside Elm Street
