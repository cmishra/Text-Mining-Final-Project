Statement on the Death of Warren Burger
June 25, 1995

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of Justice Burger's 
passing. Today the Nation mourns the loss of a great public servant.
    Justice Burger was a strong, powerful, and visionary Chief Justice 
who opened the doors of opportunity. As Chief Justice, he was concerned 
with the administration of the Court, serving with enthusiasm and always 
making sure it was above reproach.
    He also presided over the most important anniversary of our Nation 
by serving as Chair of the Bicentennial Commission on the Constitution.
    His expansive view of the Constitution and his tireless service will 
leave a lasting imprint on the Court and our Nation. Our prayers are 
with his family and friends during this time.
