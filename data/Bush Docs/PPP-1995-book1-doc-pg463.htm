Remarks to the United States-Egypt Presidents' Council
April 5, 1995

    Let me begin by welcoming you all to the White House and here to the 
Roosevelt Room and thanking you for your willingness to participate in 
this council.
    I think all of you know that the United States and Egypt have had 
and continue to have a very close relationship, and we believe that our 
future interests are very much bound up together. We believe we have to 
do more in the economic area. We need more partnerships and more success 
stories. And for my part, I am very, very committed to trying to further 
the work of increased economic interaction, bringing about more 
prosperity, more opportunity.
    So I want to thank both the Americans who are here and the Egyptians 
who are here for your willingness to serve and commit the resources and 
the efforts of this Government to the success of this endeavor. And I 
know I speak for the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and of 
course, our Trade Ambassador and Secretary of Commerce. We are convinced 
that this is an important part of our common future.
    Mr. President.

Note: The President spoke at 1 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
