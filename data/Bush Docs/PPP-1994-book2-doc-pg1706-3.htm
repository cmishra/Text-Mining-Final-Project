    The President today nominated three individuals to serve on the U.S. 
District Court: Lacy H. Thornburg for the Western District of North 
Carolina; and David Folsom and Thadd Heartfield for the Eastern District 
of Texas.
    ``These individuals have records of achievement in public service 
and the legal profession,'' the President said. ``I am confident that 
they will continue to distinguish themselves as members of the Federal 
judiciary.''

the Press Secretary.
