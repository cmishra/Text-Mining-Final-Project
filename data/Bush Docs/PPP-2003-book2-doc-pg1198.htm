Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Amendment
September 24, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2004 budget amendment 
for International Assistance Programs. This amendment would not increase 
the budgetary resources proposed in my FY 2004 Budget.
    The details of this request are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
September 25.
