Statement on the Study by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence
September 19, 1997

    Today's study released by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence 
confirms what we have known all along: that the Brady law is helping to 
keep guns out of the hands of criminals. The study also gives us more 
good news about the Brady law--that it has worked to help disrupt 
illegal gun trafficking patterns, making it more difficult for gun 
traffickers to do business.
    While States are no longer required to conduct Brady background 
checks in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision, I am pleased 
that State and local law enforcement agencies around the country are 
overwhelmingly continuing to do these checks on a voluntary basis. Our 
goal remains unchanged: no background check, no handgun purchase.
    I have pledged to do everything in my power to make sure that we 
continue to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals--including 
extending Brady background checks to violent juveniles who should not be 
able to buy a gun on their 21st birthday. Today's study further makes 
the case that for the safety of our communities and of all Americans, 
Brady background checks must continue.
