Message to the Congress Transmitting the District of Columbia Budget and 
Supplemental Appropriations Request
September 13, 1993

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and 
Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the District of 
Columbia Government's fiscal year 1994 budget amendment request and 
fiscal year 1993 supplemental budget amendment request.
    The District of Columbia Government has submitted a request to 
decrease its fiscal year 1994 general fund spending authority by $36.968 
million with a reduction of 832 FTE positions. In addition, the 
District's fiscal year 1993 supplemental amendment request includes an 
increase of $7.367 million in general fund spending authority. The 
amendments are needed to address a projected operating deficit for 
fiscal year 1993 and fiscal year 1994 that was not addressed in the 
District's original budget submission pending congressional action.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
September 13, 1993.
