Letter to House Republican Leader Robert H. Michel on NAFTA
November 15, 1993

Dear Mr. Leader:

    On more than one occasion I have been asked whether the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) might become a divisive issue in 
the 1994 Congressional elections. Each time I have been asked this 
question I have expressed the hope that this issue would continue to be 
viewed in a spirit of bipartisan cooperation befitting an issue of such 
historical importance.

    Since I have sought the support of all members of the House of 
Representatives for the NAFTA implementing legislation as a matter of 
compelling national interest, I hope to discourage NAFTA opponents from 
using this issue against pro-NAFTA members, regardless of party, in the 
coming election.

    After our shared success later this week, when I will have the 
pleasure of sending thank you letters to at least 218 House members, I 
will reaffirm my position on the inappropriateness of fighting NAFTA 
again in the 1994 election.

    As always, you have my respect and appreciation.

    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This letter was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on November 16 but was not issued as a White House press 
release.
