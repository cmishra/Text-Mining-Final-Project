Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Efforts To 
Achieve Sustainable Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina
April 19, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    As required by section 7 of the 1998 Supplemental Appropriations and 
Rescissions Act (Public Law 105-174) (the Levin Amendment), and section 
1203 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for FY 
1999 (Public Law 105-261), I transmit herewith a report on progress made 
toward achieving benchmarks for a sustainable peace process.
    In July 1999, I sent the second semiannual report to the Congress 
under Public Law 105-174, detailing progress towards achieving the 10 
benchmarks adopted by the Peace Implementation Council (PIC) and the 
North Atlantic Council (NAC) for evaluating implementation of the Dayton 
Peace Accords. This report provides an updated assessment of progress on 
the benchmarks covering the period from July 1 through December 31, 
1999.
    In addition to the semiannual reporting requirement of Public Law 
105-174, this report fulfills the requirements of section 1203 in 
connection with my Administration's request for funds for FY 2001.
         Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

 Note:  Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on April 
20.
