Exchange With Reporters in New York City
October 3, 2001

President's Visit

    Q. What's your message for New York, sir?
    The President. My message for New York is they've got great 
leadership--got great leadership with the mayor,<Giuliani, Rudolph 
W.> got great leadership with the Governor,<Pataki, George 
E.> and all of America is proud, proud of the resilience of 
this city, too. People are coming together. It's an amazing feeling to 
be here in New York City. On the one hand, you see the destruction; on 
the other hand, you see--feel the compassion of a great city. I'm real 
proud to be here with my friends.
    See you at the school.

Note: The exchange began at 11:44 a.m. outside the Federal Hall National 
Memorial. In his remarks, the President referred to Mayor Rudolph W. 
Giuliani of New York City and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York. A tape 
was not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
