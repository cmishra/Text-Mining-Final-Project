Statement on the Resignation of Frances Fragos Townsend<Townsend, 
Frances Fragos<ls-thn-eq> as Assistant to the President for Homeland 
Security and Counterterrorism
November 19, 2007

    Over the past 4\1/2\ years, Fran Townsend has served my 
administration with distinction as Assistant to the President for 
Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. Fran has always provided wise 
counsel on how to best protect the American people from the threat of 
terrorism. She has been a steady leader in the effort to prevent and 
disrupt attacks and to better respond to natural disasters.
    Fran's remarkable career as a public servant has spanned more than 
two decades. She has prosecuted violent crimes, narcotics offenses, 
mafia cases, and white collar fraud as an assistant district attorney in 
Brooklyn and as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan. During her 
career, Fran worked to protect the American people as the Counsel to the 
Attorney General for Intelligence Policy, the Assistant Commandant for 
Intelligence at the U.S. Coast Guard, and as the Deputy National 
Security Adviser for Combating Terrorism at the National Security 
Council.
    With her extensive experience, intellect, and candor, Fran has ably 
guided the Homeland Security Council. She has played an integral role in 
the formation of the key strategies and policies my administration has 
used to combat terror and protect Americans. She has traveled the world 
to meet with allies in the global war on terror and has partnered 
extensively with first-responders at the State and local level to 
enhance our preparedness. We are safer today because of her leadership.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish Fran, her husband 
John,<Townsend, John<ls-thn-eq> and their two sons James<Townsend, 
James<ls-thn-eq> and Patrick,<Townsend, Patrick<ls-thn-eq> all the best.
