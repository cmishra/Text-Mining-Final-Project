Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the District of Columbia 
Fiscal Year 2002 Budget Request and Fiscal Year 2001 Supplemental Budget 
Request
July 2, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Pursuant to my constitutional authority and consistent with sections 
202(c) and (e) of The District of Columbia Financial Management and 
Responsibility Assistance Act of 1995 and section 446 of The District of 
Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am 
transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2002 Budget Request 
Act and Fiscal Year 2001 Supplemental Budget Request.
    The proposed FY 2002 Budget Request Act reflects the major 
programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of 
Columbia. For FY 2002, the District estimates total revenues and 
expenditures of $5.3 billion, resulting in an adjusted surplus of $85.8 
million.
    The FY 2001 Supplemental Budget Request seeks approval for the 
District to use

$92.5 million in surplus local revenues to address FY 2001 budget 
pressures, and approval for the Water and Sewer Authority (an enterprise 
fund) to spend $2.2 million of its own revenue.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
July 3.
