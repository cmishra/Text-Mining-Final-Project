Nomination for Ambassadors and U.S. Attorneys
July 7, 1993

    The President has announced his intention to nominate the following 
to the position of U.S. Attorney: John W. Raley, Jr., of Oklahoma; 
Charles R. Tetzlaff of Vermont; and William D. Wilmoth of West Virginia.
    The President also intends to nominate Walter Carrington to be 
Ambassador to Nigeria and Theodore E. Russell to be Ambassador to the 
Slovak Republic.
    ``With these U.S. Attorney appointments we will continue to place 
skilled and dedicated professionals in the Justice Department,'' the 
President said. ``With the addition of Charles Tetzlaff and William 
Wilmoth and the reappointment of Attorney Raley, I believe the American 
public and the judicial system will be well served.''
    The President called Walter C. Carrington ``a career professional 
whose affiliation with several renowned international agencies, 
including several associated with African issues, makes him a sound 
choice for the Nigerian post.''
    ``Theodore Russell,'' the President said, ``has demonstrated a 
talent and dedication for foreign service throughout his career, and I 
will be pleased to make his nomination official.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
