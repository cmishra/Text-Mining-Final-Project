Remarks on Signing Legislation To Honor Senator Paul Coverdell
July 26, 2001

    Ours is a city here full of memorials, full of symbols of America's 
gratitude for service. And today we come together to honor one such man 
who dedicated his life to service, a life who left us far too soon.
    Nancy,<Coverdell, Nancy> welcome. I want to thank you and 
your family members for being here. I want to thank Trent<Lott, 
Trent> and Members of the United States Senate. One reason he 
didn't ask you to speak is, he was afraid you were going to go on too 
long, Phil.<Gramm, Phil> [Laughter] I appreciate Senator 
Miller.<Miller, Zell> I thank the Georgia delegation for 
coming, Members of the Congress. It's good to see the former 
Speaker;<Gingrich, Newt> thank you for being here as well.
    I appreciate John Ashcroft,<Ashcroft, John> the Attorney 
General, for being here, and Elaine Chao,<Chao, Elaine L.> 
members of my Cabinet. I'm so honored that members--former Directors of 
the Peace Corps are here, including the current Acting Director, Chuck 
Baquet.<Baquet, Charles R.> Thank you

for being here as well. I thank Michael Adams,<Adams, Michael> 
the president of the University of Georgia, for being here. And I want 
to thank my Ambassador-designee to the Vatican, Jim 
Nicholson,<Nicholson, Jim> for being here as well.
    Paul Coverdell was a man of unusual abilities and striking 
character. He spoke with candor when others might hide the unpleasant 
truth. He was wise and reasonable in a city that often lacks both 
virtues. He was a man of principle who understood our political system's 
essential need for compromise. He was respected by both allies and 
adversaries.
    And the causes to which he dedicated himself drew all his energy and 
thought and effort and commitment. He understood every parent's hopes 
for a quality education, so he pressed for tax-free savings accounts for 
education expenses. Today his idea is law, and today we rename those 
accounts for him, the Coverdell Education Savings Accounts.
    He had a great heart and compassion for others, and that could be 
seen in his imaginative and strong leadership of the Peace Corps. As the 
Corps' first post-cold-war Director, he had a vision for a new era and 
the leadership to bring those dreams into being. So today, in his honor, 
we rename the Peace Corps headquarters in Washington, DC, the Paul D. 
Coverdell Peace Corps Headquarters. And we also rename the Peace Corps 
World Wise School program, the Paul D. Coverdell World Wise Schools 
programs.
    Paul was a champion of science and medical research. Wherever 
Americans push the frontiers of knowledge, they're advancing in the 
spirit of Paul Coverdell. And so, I applaud Senator Miller<Miller, 
Zell> for his leadership in the decision to name the 
University of Georgia's new health science building for Paul.
    You know, Paul and Nancy<Coverdell, Nancy> were frequent 
visitors to my folks' house in Maine. They were such good friends that 
Mother got them to plant roses. She's a pretty tough taskmaster. 
[Laughter] You can imagine old Paul out there digging away, Mother 
yelling, ``More dirt!'' [Laughter] The hole would be dug and Mother 
saying, ``You put the rosebush in there.'' At any rate, we get to now 
see the roses, and we think of Paul. The flowers bloom only a short 
time, but like the roots of those bushes, his memory lasts a long time. 
And the fruits of his labors we will see for a long time coming.
    I've spoken today of honoring Paul. The truth is, he honored us by 
his selfless service. We're lucky to have known him.
    It is now my honor to sign the bills honoring a great man.

Note: The President spoke at 9:14 a.m. in the Indian Treaty Room in the 
Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building. In his remarks, he 
referred to Nancy Coverdell, widow of Senator Coverdell; Senator Phil 
Gramm of Texas; and former Speaker Newt Gingrich. S. 360 and S. 1190, 
approved July 26, were assigned Public Law Nos. 107-21 and 107-22, 
respectively.
