Remarks on the Situation in Colombia
March 4, 2008

    This morning I spoke to President Uribe<Uribe Velez, 
Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> of Colombia. He updated me on the situation in his 
country, including the continuing assault by narcoterrorists as well as 
the provocative maneuvers by the regime in Venezuela.
    I told the President<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> that America 
fully supports Colombia's democracy and that we firmly oppose any acts 
of aggression that could destabilize the region. I told him that America 
will continue to stand with Colombia as it confronts violence and terror 
and fights drug traffickers.
    President Uribe<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> told me that one of 
the most important ways America can demonstrate its support for Colombia 
is by moving forward with a free trade agreement that we negotiated. The 
free trade agreement will show the Colombian people that democracy and 
free enterprise lead to a better life. It will help President Uribe 
counter the radical vision of those who are

seeking to undermine democracy and create divisions within our 
hemisphere.
    Our country's message to President Uribe<Uribe Velez, 
Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> and the people of Colombia is that we stand with our 
democratic ally. My message to the United States Congress is that this 
trade agreement is more than a matter of smart economics; it is a matter 
of national security. If we fail to approve this agreement, we will let 
down our close ally, we will damage our credibility in the region, and 
we will embolden the demagogues in our hemisphere.
    The President<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> told me that the people 
across the region are watching to see what the United States will do. So 
Republicans and Democrats in Congress need to come together and approve 
this agreement. By acting at this critical moment, we can show the 
Colombian people and millions across the region that they can count on 
America to keep its word and that freedom is the surest path to 
prosperity and peace.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 1:05 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish 
language transcript of these remarks.
