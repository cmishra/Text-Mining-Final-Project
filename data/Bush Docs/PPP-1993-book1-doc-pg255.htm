Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With the Congressional Black 
Caucus
March 8, 1993

Spending Cuts

    Q. Mr. President, do you agree to the extra $50 billion in cuts that 
the House and Senate leaders want?
    The President. I agree that we will have a budget resolution which 
will be roughly conforming to the reestimates of the CBO in general 
terms and that will still contain the investment strategy that I want to 
pursue.

Note: The exchange began at 5:11 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the White 
House.
