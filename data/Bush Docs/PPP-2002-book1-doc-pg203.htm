Remarks to the United States Winter Olympic Athletes in Salt Lake City
February 8, 2002

    Well, thank you very much. I'm not deserving, but I'm proud to wear 
this jacket. I want to congratulate our great country's Olympic team. I 
want to thank you all for your efforts. I want to thank you for your 
hard work. The whole country is pulling for you, and we're really proud 
of you.
    I want to thank all those who've worked to make these games go well: 
Mitt Romney,<Romney, Mitt> Sandy Baldwin,<Baldwin, 
Sandy> Lloyd Ward,<Ward, Lloyd> Dwight Bell,<Bell, 
Dwight> Bernie Machen.<Machen, J. Bernard> I want to 
thank your coaches and your families.
    Today we're joined by three Port Authority Police Officers from New 
York City: Tony Scannella,<Scannella, Tony> Curt 
Kellinger,<Kellinger, Curt> Frank Accardi.<Accardi, 
Frank> Where are they? There they are. [Applause] Thank you 
all for coming. And as you know, they brought with them one of the flags 
that flew in front of the World Trade Center on September the 11th, 
which will be carried into the Olympic Stadium today. This flag serves 
as a symbol of this Nation's strength, of our resolve, of our 
determination to fight for freedom.
    These games come at a perfect time for the country. In our time of 
sadness and determination and resolve, our Olympic athletes will 
represent the best of America. I can't wait for Americans to see our 
flag fly. It is such a proud moment for all of us. This Nation is 
steadfast and unified, and you, the athletes, are going to represent us 
with such class and dignity and courage.
    It's a chance for the world to see that in times of war, we can come 
together in friendly competition to promote the peace. So not only you 
represent the greatest nation on the face of the Earth, you represent a 
spirit that is much bigger than evil and terror: You represent peace.
    A lot of people are going to be watching you, particularly a lot of 
kids. You'll become heroes overnight. That's an awesome responsibility. 
I know you'll handle it with grace. I know you'll set the best example 
possible.

    And so we're here to wish you all the best, to congratulate you. 
Let's roll. God bless.
