Remarks Prior to a Meeting With the Congressional Hispanic Caucus
April 2, 2001

    I thank you all for coming. It's my honor to welcome Chairman 
Reyes<Reyes, Silvestre<ls-thn-eq> and members of the Hispanic Caucus 
here. I thank them for coming. It's going to give us a very good chance 
to get to know each other on a personal basis, as well as to talk about 
some issues that are of deep concern to the Members of the Congress. And 
Mr. Chairman, I'm honored to have you here.

    One of the things that I know the chairman<Reyes, 
Silvestre<ls-thn-eq> knows is that I respect the Hispanic culture a lot. 
When I was a Governor for the State of Texas, I used to remind my fellow 
Texans that our State was richer as a result of the Hispanic culture. 
And I look forward to working with the members here on a variety of 
issues, not the least of which is to make sure the world is more 
peaceful, more educated, and more prosperous.
    So, thank you all for coming. Thank you for being here.

Note: The President spoke at 5:24 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Representative Silvestre Reyes, 
chairman, Congressional Hispanic Caucus. A tape was not available for 
verification of the content of these remarks.
