Statement on House of Representatives Passage of a Budget Framework 
Resolution
April 28, 2005

    I applaud the House for passing a budget framework that protects 
America, helps economic growth, funds our priorities, and keeps us on 
track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. This is a responsible budget 
that reins in spending to limits not seen in years. I appreciate the 
Members of Congress in the House and the Senate who worked hard to 
produce this agreement and who support its passage. It is not the 
Government's money that gets spent in Washington, DC. It is the people's 
money, and taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely or not spent at all.
