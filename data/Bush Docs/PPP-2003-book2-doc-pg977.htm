August 4, 2003

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense

Subject: Provision of Atomic Information to the Czech Republic, the 
Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Poland, and Spain

    In your memorandum to me of July 18, 2003, you recommended that I 
approve pursuant to sections 123 and 144 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended, an agreement for cooperation within the context of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as between the Government of 
the United States and the following four members of NATO: the Czech 
Republic, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Poland, and Spain, 
hereinafter the ``New Parties.'' The subject agreement is the Agreement 
between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty for Co-operation 
Regarding Atomic Information, including a technical annex and security 
annex (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ATOMAL Agreement), 
which entered into force on March 12, 1965, with respect to the United 
States and the other members of NATO at that time.
    Having considered your recommendations and the cooperation provided 
for in the ATOMAL Agreement with respect to the New Parties, in 
accordance with sections 123 and 144 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended, I hereby:
    a. Determine that the performance of the ATOMAL Agreement, including 
the proposed cooperation and the proposed communication of Restricted 
Data thereunder, with respect to the New Parties, will promote the 
common defense and security, and will not constitute an unreasonable 
risk to those interests.
    b. Approve the ATOMAL Agreement with respect to the New Parties.
    c. Authorize the Department of Defense to cooperate with the New 
Parties to the ATOMAL Agreement in the context of NATO upon satisfaction 
of the requirements of section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended.

                                                     George W. Bush
