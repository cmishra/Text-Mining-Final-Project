Memorandum on Abortions in Military Hospitals
January 22, 1993

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense

Subject: Privately Funded Abortions at Military Hospitals

    Section 1093 of title 10 of the United States Code prohibits the use 
of Department of Defense (``DOD'') funds to perform abortions except 
where the life of a woman would be endangered if the fetus were carried 
to term. By memoranda of December 21, 1987, and June 21, 1988, DOD has 
gone beyond what I am informed are the requirements of the statute and 
has banned all abortions at U.S. military facilities, even where the 
procedure is privately funded. This ban is unwarranted. Accordingly, I 
hereby direct that you reverse the ban immediately and permit abortion 
services to be provided, if paid for entirely with non-DOD funds and in 
accordance with other relevant DOD policies and procedures.
    You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in 
the Federal Register.

                                                      William J. Clinton

[Filed with the Office of the Federal Register, 11:50 a.m., January 27, 
1993]
