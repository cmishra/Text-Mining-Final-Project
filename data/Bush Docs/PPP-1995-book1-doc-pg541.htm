Statement on the Crash of an Air Force C-21 in Alabama
April 18, 1995

    Hillary and I were very saddened to learn of the crash of an Air 
Force C-21 aircraft near Alexander City, Alabama, last night, with the 
loss of eight lives. The death of these individuals is a tragic loss for 
the U.S. Air Force and the Nation. Their death reminds us all how much 
we are indebted to those military and civilian personnel who serve in 
the defense of our Nation. Our hearts and our prayers go out to the 
families and friends of those who were killed.
