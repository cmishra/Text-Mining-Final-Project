Statement on the Decision of Representative Louis Stokes<Stokes, 
Louis<ls-thn-eq> Not To Seek Reelection
January 18, 1998

    Throughout his illustrious career in the United States Congress, 
Representative Louis Stokes has been a champion of America's finest 
values. He has worked tirelessly to better the lives of our children and 
our veterans and has stood steadfast in an effort to bring our country 
together amid all of our diversity to build a stronger community.
    Representative Stokes has been a true advocate for the people of 
Cleveland and for all Americans who support giving people the tools they 
need to make the most of their own lives. He has served our country from 
the bottom of his heart, and his retirement after three decades of 
dedicated service will be a loss felt by all.
