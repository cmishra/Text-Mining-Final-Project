Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Russia-United States 
Fisheries Agreement Extension
January 20, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an 
Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Russian Federation extending the Agreement on Mutual 
Fisheries Relations of May 31, 1988, with annex, as amended and extended 
(the ``Mutual Fisheries Agreement''). The present Agreement, which was 
effected by an exchange of notes in Moscow on July 28 and November 23, 
1998, extends the Mutual Fisheries Agreement to December 31, 2003.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Russian Federation, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate.
