Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to Certain Terrorist Attacks
September 5, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the
emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. 
Consistent with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to the 
terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, is to 
continue in effect for an additional year.

[[Page 1611]]

    The terrorist threat that led to the declaration on September 14, 
2001, of a national emergency continues. For this reason, I have 
determined that it is necessary to continue in effect after September 
14, 2006, the national emergency with respect to the terrorist threat.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
