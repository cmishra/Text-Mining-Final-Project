Statement on the Identification of Vietnam War Unknown Soldier
June 30, 1998

    DNA testing positively identified the remains of the Vietnam War 
unknown disinterred from the Tomb of the Unknowns in May as those of the 
Air Force 1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie<Blassie, Michael J.<ls-thn-eq>. The 
Defense Department has notified the Blassie family and the other 
families involved in resolving this difficult case. I am pleased that 
one more family has finally learned the fate of a loved one, and I 
remain committed to seeking a full accounting of the missing in action 
from that conflict.
