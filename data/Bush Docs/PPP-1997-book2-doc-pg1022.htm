Message to the Senate Transmitting World Intellectual Property 
Organization Treaties With Documentation
July 28, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty and the 
World Intellectual Property Organization Performances and Phonograms 
Treaty, done at Geneva on December 20, 1996, and signed by the United 
States on April 12, 1997. Also transmitted is the report of the 
Department of State with respect to the Treaties.
    These Treaties are in the best interests of the United States. They 
ensure that international copyright rules will keep pace with 
technological change, thus affording important protection against piracy 
for U.S. rightsholders in the areas of music, film, computer software, 
and information products. The terms of the Treaties are thus consistent 
with the United States policy of encouraging other countries to provide 
adequate and effective intellectual property protection.
    Legislation is required to implement certain provisions of the 
Treaties. Legislation is also required to ensure that parties to the 
Treaties are granted, under U.S. copyright law, the rights to which they 
are entitled under the Treaties. That legislation is being prepared and 
is expected to be submitted shortly.
    I recommend, therefore, that the Senate give early and favorable 
consideration to the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and 
Phonograms Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification, 
subject to a declaration under Article 15(3) of the WIPO Performances 
and Phonograms Treaty described in the accompanying State Department 
report.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 28, 1997.
