Statement on the Situation in Burma
May 1, 2008

    The people of Burma have long awaited the opportunity to live in a 
true democracy. The referendum vote scheduled for May 10, 2008, could 
have been that opportunity. However, Than Shwe<Than Shwe<ls-thn-eq> and 
his regime are ensuring that the referendum vote will be on a 
dangerously flawed Constitution and will not be free, fair, or credible. 
They continue to ignore calls from the Burmese people and the 
international community for a genuine process that could result in a 
legitimate Constitution reflecting the will of the people, and they 
continue to carry out a campaign to intimidate voters and to arrest 
those who dare speak out against the flaws of the referendum and draft 
Constitution.
    The regime has not acted on any of the measures called for by the 
United Nations Security Council and does not cooperate with Special 
Adviser Ibrahim Gambari.<Gambari, Ibrahim Agboola<ls-thn-eq> We have 
called for the early release of all political prisoners; implementation 
of measures to address the political, economic, humanitarian, and human 
rights issues that are of concern; and the creation of necessary 
conditions for a genuine dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi<Aung San Suu 
Kyi<ls-thn-eq> and all concerned parties and ethnic groups in order to 
achieve an inclusive national reconciliation. Furthermore, the regime 
has refused offers from Mr. Gambari to provide technical assistance or 
international monitors for the pending referendum.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are committed to work for the 
people of Burma and help in their struggle to free themselves from the 
regime's tyranny. I have signed a new Executive order that will block 
all property and interests in property of designated individuals and 
entities determined to be owned or controlled by, directly or 
indirectly, the Government of Burma or an official or officials of the 
Government of Burma. This Executive order expands existing authorities 
that allow the United States Government

to target those who are responsible for supporting, empowering, and 
enriching the Burmese regime, a regime that exploits and oppresses the 
people of Burma.
    The United States will continue to pressure Burma's rulers until 
they respond to the legitimate calls of the Burmese people for a genuine 
dialogue leading to a democratic transition.

Note: The statement referred to Senior Gen. Than Shwe, Chairman, State 
Peace and Development Council of Burma; United Nations Special Envoy to 
Myanmar Ibrahim Gambari; and Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the National 
League for Democracy in Burma.
