Statement on the Death of Caspar Weinberger<Weinberger, 
Caspar<ls-thn-eq>
March 28, 2006

    Caspar Weinberger was an American statesman and a dedicated public 
servant. He wore the uniform in World War II, held elected office, and 
served in the Cabinets of three Presidents. As Secretary of Defense for 
President Reagan, he worked to strengthen our military and win the cold 
war. In all his years, this good man made many contributions to our 
Nation. America is grateful for Caspar Weinberger's lifetime of service. 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our condolences and prayers to 
the entire Weinberger family.
