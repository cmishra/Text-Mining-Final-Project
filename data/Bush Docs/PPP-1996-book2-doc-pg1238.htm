Statement on Health Care Legislation
July 31, 1996

    Today we have apparently achieved a long overdue victory for the 
millions of Americans who live in fear of losing their health insurance 
when they change or lose their jobs or because of preexisting 
conditions. I hope all Democrats and Republicans will work together to 
pass this important legislation before the Congress begins its August 
recess.
