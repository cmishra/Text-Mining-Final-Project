Statement on Senate Passage of United States-India Civil Nuclear 
Cooperation Legislation
November 17, 2006

    The United States and India enjoy a strategic partnership based upon 
common values. Today the Senate has acted to further strengthen this 
relationship by passing legislation that will deliver energy, 
nonproliferation, and trade benefits to the citizens of two great 
democracies.
    The U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement will bring India 
into the international nuclear nonproliferation mainstream and will 
increase the transparency of India's entire civilian nuclear program. As 
India's economy continues to grow, this partnership will help India meet 
its energy needs without increasing air pollution and greenhouse gas 
emissions. It will also help reduce India's dependence upon imported 
fossil fuels. By increasing India's demand for civil nuclear technology, 
fuel, and support services, this historic agreement creates new business 
opportunities for American companies and enhances our trade 
relationship.
    I appreciate the Senate's leadership on this important legislation 
and look forward to signing this bill into law soon.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 5682, which was passed with 
amendments by the Senate on November 16.
