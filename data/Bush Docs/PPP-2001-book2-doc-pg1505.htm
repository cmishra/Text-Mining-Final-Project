Statement on the Congressional Conference Agreement on Education Reform 
Legislation
December 11, 2001

    The education of every child in America must always be a top 
priority. I commend the conferees for agreeing on a series of profound 
reforms to help provide our children the best education possible. I also 
thank the bipartisan leadership of the conference chair, Congressmen 
Boehner,<Boehner, John A.> as well as Senators 
Kennedy<Kennedy, Edward M.> and Gregg<Gregg, Judd> 
and Congressman Miller,<Miller, George> for taking major steps 
toward improving education throughout our country.
    The conference agreement will ensure that no child in America is 
left behind, through historic education reforms based on real 
accountability, unprecedented flexibility for States and school 
districts, greater local control, more options for parents, and more 
funding for what works. I urge Members of the House and Senate to act 
soon and send me this legislation so that States and school districts 
can begin implementing these important reforms.
