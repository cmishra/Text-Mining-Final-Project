Statement on Representative W.J. `` Billy'' Tauzin's<Tauzin, W.J. 
``Billy''<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not To Seek Reelection
February 4, 2004

    Billy Tauzin has always been a friend to American consumers and 
seniors as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is a 
strong leader and a good friend, and we will miss his experience and 
sense of humor. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish Billy and 
Cecile<Tauzin, Cecile<ls-thn-eq> the best.
