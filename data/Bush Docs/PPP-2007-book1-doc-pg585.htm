To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom 
Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public 
Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export to the People's Republic 
of China of the following items is not detrimental to the U.S. space 
launch industry, and that the material and equipment, including any 
indirect technical benefit that could be derived from such exports, will 
not measurably improve the missile or space launch capabilities of the 
People's Republic of China:
  <bullet>   A four-axis filament winding machine for production of 
            spare parts for China's water purification and treatment 
            industries;
  <bullet>   A computer control system upgrade to a three-axis filament 
            winding machine for production of spare parts for China's 
            water purification and treatment industries;
  <bullet>   An isostatic press for manufacturing automotive spare 
            parts; and
  <bullet>   A four-axis filament winding machine to be used in 
            production of graphite or glass composite golf clubs.

                                                          George W. Bush
