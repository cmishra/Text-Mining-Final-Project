Remarks, in Paris, on the Death of President Ronald Reagan<Reagan, 
Ronald W.<ls-thn-eq>
June 6, 2004

    This is a sad hour in the life of America. A great American life has 
come to an end. I have just spoken to Nancy Reagan.<Reagan, 
Nancy<ls-thn-eq> On behalf of our whole Nation, Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I offered her and the Reagan family our prayers and 
our condolences.
    Ronald Reagan won America's respect with his greatness and won its 
love with his goodness. He had the confidence that comes with 
conviction, the strength that comes with character, the grace that comes 
with humility, and the humor that comes with wisdom. He leaves behind a 
nation he restored and a world he helped save.
    During the years of President Reagan, America laid to rest an era of 
division and self-doubt. And because of his leadership, the world laid 
to rest an era of fear and tyranny. Now, in laying our leader to rest, 
we say thank you.
    He always told us that for America, the best was yet to come. We 
comfort ourselves in the knowledge that this is true for him too. His 
work is done, and now a shining city awaits him.
    May God bless Ronald Reagan.

Note: The President spoke at 12:41 a.m. at the U.S. Ambassador's 
residence. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish 
language transcript of these remarks. The related proclamation and 
Executive order of June 6 are listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume. The related proclamation of July 2 is in the Federal Register at 
69 FR 41179.
