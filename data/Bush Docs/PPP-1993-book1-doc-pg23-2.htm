Nomination for Deputy Secretary of Commerce
January 29, 1993

    The President today nominated John A. Rollwagen, the head of the 
world's largest manufacturer of supercomputers, to be the Deputy 
Secretary of Commerce. Rollwagen is the chairman and CEO of Cray 
Research, Inc.
    ``The Department of Commerce will play a leading role in the 
development of a high skill, high wage economy,'' President Clinton 
said. ``Having presided over a high skill, high wage corporation for 15 
years, John Rollwagen can help us bring this about. As a proven CEO of a 
high technology company, Rollwagen is an innovative thinker and highly 
respected manager. He combines business savvy, international experience, 
and high technology knowledge. I'm convinced that he is the best choice 
to work together with Secretary Ron Brown to make the Commerce 
Department a powerful part of our administration's work of restoring the 
competitiveness of American business,'' said the President.

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
