Statement on the Resignation of H. James Towey<Towey, H. 
James<ls-thn-eq> as Director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community 
Initiatives
April 18, 2006

    Jim Towey is a dedicated public servant who has served as a vital 
member of my administration for more than 4 years. Under his leadership, 
the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives has applied the 
compassion of America to help solve some of our most challenging 
problems. His office has held 23 conferences around the country, 
assisting tens of thousands among America's armies of compassion. Eleven 
Federal departments and agencies now have Centers for Faith-Based and 
Community Initiatives that are building upon and expanding their good 
works in neighborhoods across the country.
    Throughout his life, Jim has worked for Democrats and Republicans as 
an advocate for those in need. He served as Mother Teresa's legal 
counsel for many years. His work on behalf of the poor and the sick has 
improved lives. I admire Jim for his compassion, his faith, and his 
sense of humor. He is a man of great integrity, and I thank him for his 
service. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish Jim, Mary,<Towey, 
Mary<ls-thn-eq> and the Towey family all the best.
