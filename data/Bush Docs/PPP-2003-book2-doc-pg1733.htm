Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243), the Authorization for the

keep the Congress fully informed, I am providing a report prepared by my 
Administration. This report includes matters relating to post-liberation 
Iraq under section 7 of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-
338).
        Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the
