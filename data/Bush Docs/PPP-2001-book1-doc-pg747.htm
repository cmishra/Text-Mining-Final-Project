    This meeting affirms the high regard in which United States holds 
these strong African democracies. Our relationship is based on shared 
democratic values.
    President Bush joins Presidents Kufuor of Ghana, Wade of Senegal, 
and Konare of Mali in affirming our shared opposition to governments 
that come to power or seek to retain power by unconstitutional means. 
The United States opposes any action that undermines legitimate, 
democratic rule, including coups and other direct power grabs, as well 
as constitutional changes orchestrated solely to promote an incumbent's 
hold on power or to impede an opponent.
    The leaders agreed to continue our mutual efforts to promote 
regional peace and prosperity. The United States welcomes and 
appreciates the participation of Ghana, Senegal, and Mali in initiatives 
to further regional security, such as the African Crisis Response 
Initiative and Operation Focus Relief.
    Stability and peace are ends in themselves, but they are also 
essential prerequisites for economic prosperity, development, and 
poverty alleviation. The United States welcomes the region's efforts to 
promote stability, as the precursors to investment and economic growth, 
but also ongoing efforts to break down barriers to regional trade and 
investment. President Bush also welcomes African development 
initiatives, such as the Millennium Africa Recovery and OMEGA plans. An 
integrated West Africa would be best positioned to take advantage of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act.
    The leaders expressed a joint commitment to remain engaged in 
efforts to promote peace, stability, and democracy in West Africa, and 
President Bush reaffirmed that the United State will work with the 
region to build mechanisms to prevent and, when necessary, contain and 
end conflict.
