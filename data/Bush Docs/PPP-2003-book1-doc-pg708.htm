Statement on the Death of Strom Thurmond<Thurmond, Strom> 
June 27, 2003

    Senator Strom Thurmond led an extraordinary life. He served in the 
Army during World War II, earning a Bronze Star for valor and landing at 
Normandy on D-Day. He served his country as Senator, Governor, and State 
legislator and was a beloved teacher, coach, husband, father, and 
grandfather. While campaigning across South Carolina with him in 1988, I 
saw firsthand the tremendous love he had for his constituents and the 
admiration the people of South Carolina had for him. He was also a 
friend, and I was honored to have hosted his 100th birthday at the White 
House. Laura<Bush, Laura> joins me in sending our prayers and 
condolences to the entire Thurmond family. He will be missed.
