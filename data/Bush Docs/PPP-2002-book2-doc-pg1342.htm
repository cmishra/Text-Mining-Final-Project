Exchange With Reporters in Prout's Neck
August 3, 2002

President's Vacation

    Q. Relaxing a bit?
    The President. What?
    Q. You've got your shirt off.
    The President. If you sweated through your shirt as much as I've 
sweated through mine, it would be off too.

Iraq

    Q. Can we ask about Iraq for a second?
    The President. No. You heard what I said in there. I'm a patient 
man. I'll use all the tools at our disposal. Nothing's changed.

Note: The exchange began at 5 p.m. at a boat dock near the Black Point 
Inn. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this 
exchange.
