Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to the Lapse of the Export Administration Act of 
1979
August 13, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    On August 19, 1994, in light of the expiration of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.), I 
issued Executive Order 12924, declaring a national emergency and 
continuing the system of export regulation under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). Under section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), the national 
emergency terminates on the anniversary date of its declaration unless 
the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice of its continuation.
    I am hereby advising the Congress that I have extended the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 12924. Enclosed is a copy of the 
notice of extension.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on August 14. 
The notice of August 13 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
