Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments
June 13, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2006 budget 
amendments for the Department of Justice and the General Services 
Administration. In addition, this transmittal contains FY 2006 budget 
amendments for the Legislative and Judicial Branches. As a matter of 
comity, appropriations requests of the Legislative and Judicial Branches 
are commonly transmitted without change.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on
