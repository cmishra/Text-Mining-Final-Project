Statement on Disaster Assistance for Georgia
October 13, 1994

    I am pleased that we can provide additional assistance to the people 
of Georgia in their efforts to rebuild their communities. I look forward 
to working in cooperation with them in the recovery.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the President's decision to authorize an increase in the Federal 
Government's part of the cost-share program for repairing flood-damaged 
public property.
