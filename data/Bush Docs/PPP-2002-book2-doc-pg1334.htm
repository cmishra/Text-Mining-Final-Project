Statement on Senate Action on Trade Promotion Authority Legislation
August 1, 2002

    The Senate's bipartisan passage of trade promotion authority 
completes an accomplishment that has eluded Congress since 1994 and is a 
major victory on behalf of working Americans. With TPA, we will open 
markets to create high-paying jobs and provide new opportunities for 
America's farmers and workers. I thank the House and Senate for passing 
TPA so that we can work together to advance America's free trade agenda. 
With this important tool, we will promote prosperity in the United 
States, progress in our hemisphere, and freedom throughout the world.
