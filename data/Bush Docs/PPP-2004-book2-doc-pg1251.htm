Statement on the Death of President Thomas Klestil<Klestil, 
Thomas<ls-thn-eq> of Austria
July 8, 2004

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I offer our deepest condolences to 
the people of Austria and to the Klestil family on the death of 
President Thomas Klestil.
    President Klestil was a distinguished statesman who had previously 
served as Austria's Ambassador to the United States and as Austria's 
Permanent Representative to the United Nations. President Klestil was 
well known in the United States as a man dedicated to freedom and human 
dignity, and as President he was a committed and eloquent advocate of 
these values. We join all the people of Austria in mourning his passing.
