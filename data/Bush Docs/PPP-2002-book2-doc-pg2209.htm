Statement on Senator Trent Lott's<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not To 
Seek the Senate Majority Leader's Position
December 20, 2002

    I respect the very difficult decision Trent made on behalf of the 
American people. As Majority and Minority Leader of the Senate, Trent 
Lott improved education for the American people; he led the way in 
securing tax relief; he strengthened our national security; and he stood 
for a bold and effective foreign policy. Trent is a valued friend, and a 
man I respect. I am pleased he will continue to serve our Nation in the 
Senate, and I look forward to working with him on our agenda to make 
America safer, stronger, and better.
