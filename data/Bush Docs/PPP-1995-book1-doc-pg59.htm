Statement on Action on Congressional Accountability Legislation
January 17, 1995

    I want to commend the Congress for passing the Congressional 
Accountability Act of 1995 today. It is about time that Congress lived 
by the same laws it places on the private sector. Passage of this bill 
fulfills a campaign commitment of mine.
    However, while this legislation is an important political reform, it 
is only the first step in what must be a greater effort to change 
business-as-usual in Washington. Therefore, I reiterate my call for 
Congress to act swiftly on several much needed reform proposals 
including real campaign finance reform and the gift ban and a strong 
version of the line-item veto.
