Remarks on Presenting Posthumously the Congressional Medal of Honor to 
Corporal Jason Dunham
January 11, 2007

    Welcome to the White House. The Medal of Honor is the highest award 
for valor a President can bestow. The medal is given for gallantry in 
the face of an enemy attack that is above and beyond the call of duty. 
The medal is part of a cherished American tradition that began in this 
house with the signature of President Abraham Lincoln.
    Since World War II, more than half of those who have been awarded 
the Medal of Honor have lost their lives in the action that earned it. 
Corporal Jason Dunham belongs to this select group. On a dusty road in 
western Iraq, Corporal Dunham gave his own life so that the men under 
his command might live. This morning it's my privilege to recognize 
Corporal Dunham's devotion to the Corps and country and to present his 
family with the Medal of Honor.
    I welcome the Vice President's<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> presence; 
Secretary of Defense Bob Gates;<Gates, Robert M.<ls-thn-eq> Senator Ted 
Stevens;<Stevens, Theodore F.<ls-thn-eq> Senator John McCain;<McCain, 
John<ls-thn-eq> Senator Craig<Thomas, Craig L.<ls-thn-eq> Thomas--I 
don't know if you say former marine or marine--marine; Congressman Bill 
Young<Young, C. William<ls-thn-eq> and his wife Beverly;<Young, Beverly 
Angello<ls-thn-eq> Congressman Duncan Hunter;<Hunter, Duncan 
L.<ls-thn-eq> Congressman John<Kline, John<ls-thn-eq> Kline, marine; 
Congressman Randy Kuhl,<Kuhl, John R. ``Randy,'' Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Corporal 
Dunham's family's United States Congressman, is with us; Secretary Don 
Winter;<Winter, Donald C.<ls-thn-eq> General Pete Pace;<Pace, 
Peter<ls-thn-eq> General Jim Conway<Conway, James T.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Annette;<Conway, Annette<ls-thn-eq> Sergeant Major John 
Estrada,<Estrada, John L.<ls-thn-eq> Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps.
    I appreciate the Medal of Honor recipients who have joined us: 
Barney Barnum,<Barnum, Harvey C.<ls-thn-eq> Bob Foley,<Foley, Robert 
F.<ls-thn-eq> Bob Howard,<Howard, Robert L.<ls-thn-eq> Gary 
Littrell,<Littrell, Gary L.<ls-thn-eq> Al Rascon,<Rascon, 
Alfred<ls-thn-eq> Brian Thacker.<Thacker, Brian M.<ls-thn-eq> Thanks for 
joining us.
    I appreciate the Dunham family who have joined us and will soon join 
me on this platform to receive the honor on behalf of their son: 
Dan<Dunham, Dan<ls-thn-eq> and Deb Dunham;<Dunham, Deb<ls-thn-eq> Justin 
Dunham<Dunham, Justin<ls-thn-eq> and Kyle Dunham,<Dunham, 
Kyle<ls-thn-eq> brothers; Katie Dunham,<Dunham, Katie<ls-thn-eq> sister; 
and a lot of other family members who have joined us today.
    I appreciate the Chaplain<Burt, Robert F.<ls-thn-eq> for the Navy--
excuse me, for the Marine Corps. I didn't mean to insult you. [Laughter]
    I thank Major Trent<Gibson, Trent<ls-thn-eq> Gibson--he was Jason 
Dunham's commander--company commander; First Lieutenant Brian 
Robinson,<Robinson, Brian<ls-thn-eq> who was his platoon commander. I 
welcome all the marines from ``Kilo-3-7.'' Thanks for coming, and thanks 
for serving.
    Long before he earned our Nation's highest medal, Jason Dunham made 
himself--made a name for himself among his friends and neighbors. He was 
born in a small town in upstate New York. He was a normal kind of 
fellow. He loved sports. He went to Scio Central School, and he starred 
on the Tiger basketball, soccer, and baseball teams. And by the way, he 
still

holds the record for the highest batting average in a single season at 
.414. He was popular with his teammates, and that could be a problem for 
his mom.<Dunham, Deb<ls-thn-eq> You see, she never quite knew how many 
people would be showing up for dinner, whether it be her family or the 
entire basketball team.
    He grew up with the riches far more important than money. He had a 
dad<Dunham, Dan<ls-thn-eq> who loved to take his boys on a ride with him 
when he made his rounds on the dairy farm where he worked. His 
mom<Dunham, Deb<ls-thn-eq> was a school teacher. She figured out the 
best way to improve her son's spelling was to combine his love for 
sports with her ability to educate. And so she taught him the words from 
his reading list when they played the basketball game of ``horse.'' He 
had two<Dunham, Justin<ls-thn-eq> brothers<Dunham, Kyle<ls-thn-eq> and a 
sister<Dunham, Katie<ls-thn-eq> who adored him.
    He had a natural gift for leadership and a compassion that led him 
to take others under his wing. The Marine Corps took the best of this 
young man and made it better. As a marine, he was taught that honor, 
courage, and commitment are not just words; they're core values for a 
way of life that elevates service above self. As a marine, Jason was 
taught that leaders put the needs of their men before their own. He was 
taught that while America's founding truths are self-evident, they also 
need to be defended by good men and women willing to stand up to 
determined enemies.
    As a leader of a rifle squad in Iraq, Corporal Dunham lived by the 
values he had been taught. He was a guy everybody looked up to. He was a 
marine's marine who led by example. He was the kind of person who would 
stop patrols to play street soccer with the Iraqi schoolchildren. He was 
the guy who signed on for an extra 2 months in Iraq so he could stay 
with his squad. As he explained it, he wanted to ``make sure that 
everyone makes it home alive.'' Corporal Dunham took that promise 
seriously and would give his own life to make it good.
    In April 2004, during an attack near Iraq's Syrian border, Corporal 
Dunham was assaulted by an insurgent who jumped out of a vehicle that 
was about to be searched. As Corporal Dunham wrestled the man to the 
ground, the insurgent rolled out a grenade he had been hiding. Corporal 
Dunham did not hesitate. He jumped on the grenade, using his helmet and 
body to absorb the blast. Although he survived the initial explosion, he 
did not survive his wounds. But by his selflessness, Corporal Dunham 
saved the lives of two of his<Hampton, William<ls-thn-eq> men<Miller, 
Kelly D.<ls-thn-eq> and showed the world what it means to be a marine.
    Deb Dunham<Dunham, Deb<ls-thn-eq> calls the Marine Corps her son's 
second family, and she means that literally. Deb describes her son's 
relationship to his men this way: ``Jay was part guardian angel, part 
big brother, and all marine.'' She remembers her son calling from the 
barracks and then passing the phone to one of his marines, saying, 
``I've got a guy here who just needs to talk to a mom.'' Now it's the 
marines who comfort her. On special days like Christmas or Mother's Day 
or her birthday, Deb has learned the day will not pass without one of 
Jason's fellow marines calling to check on her.
    With this medal, we pay tribute to the courage and leadership of a 
man who represents the best of young Americans. With this medal, we ask 
the God who commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves to wrap His 
arms around the family of Corporal Jason Dunham, a marine who is not 
here today because he lived that commandment to the fullest.
    I now invite<Dunham, Dan<ls-thn-eq> the<Dunham, Deb<ls-thn-eq> 
Dunhams<Dunham, Justin<ls-thn-eq> to<Dunham, Kyle<ls-thn-eq> 
join<Dunham, Katie<ls-thn-eq> me on the stage. And, Colonel,<McCarthy, 
Thomas<ls-thn-eq> please read the citation.
