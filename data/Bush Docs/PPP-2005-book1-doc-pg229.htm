Statement on the Request for Fiscal Year 2005 Supplemental 
Appropriations for Ongoing Military and Intelligence Operations and 
Selected Other International Activities
February 14, 2005

    With the help of the United States and coalition partners, the Iraqi 
and Afghan people have set their countries on the path of democracy and 
freedom. As both nations work to cement this great progress, our troops 
and assistance will continue to play a critical role.
    The majority of this request will ensure that our troops continue to 
get what they need to protect themselves and complete their mission. It 
also provides for the continued pursuit of Al Qaida and other terrorist 
elements in Afghanistan and elsewhere. And it reflects our core mission 
in Iraq and Afghanistan by providing funding to accelerate efforts to 
train and equip Iraqi and Afghan forces, so they can assume greater 
responsibility for their own security, and our troops can return home 
with the honor they have earned.
    Other important funding in this emergency request includes resources 
to seize the opportunity to build peace and democracy in the Middle 
East, to continue helping nations affected by the tsunamis, and to 
address other unforeseen needs.

    I urge the Congress to move quickly so our troops and diplomats have 
the tools they need to succeed.
