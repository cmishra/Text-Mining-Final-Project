Statement on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Report on Tobacco and Youth
February 15, 1996

    This week at the White House, I heard directly from a group of 
children about the easy access and allure of cigarettes.
    This report is further evidence that parents need all the help they 
can get in their daily struggle to keep our kids tobacco-free.
    Every day, more than 3,000 young people become regular smokers. 
Nearly a thousand of them will have their lives shortened because of 
tobacco-related illnesses. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable 
death in this country, contributing to more than 30 percent of all 
cancer deaths.
    Let me be clear: This administration will continue to lead the fight 
to help parents protect children from the hazards of tobacco addiction.

Note: The Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention released the report entitled ``Accessibility of 
Tobacco Products to Youths Aged 12-17 Years--United States, 1989 and 
1993'' on February 16.
