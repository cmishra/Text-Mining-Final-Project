Statement on Senate Passage of India-United States Nuclear Cooperation 
and Nonproliferation Legislation
October 1, 2008

    I congratulate the Senate on passing the United States-India Nuclear 
Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act, H.R. 7081. In 
particular, I commend the members of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee for their leadership in crafting this important bipartisan 
legislation. I also thank Majority Leader Reid<Reid, Harry<ls-thn-eq> 
and Minority Leader McConnell<McConnell, Addison M. ``Mitch''<ls-thn-eq> 
for bringing this bill to a vote prior to the Senate's adjournment. This 
legislation will strengthen our global nuclear nonproliferation efforts, 
protect the environment, create jobs, and assist India in meeting its 
growing energy needs in a responsible manner.
    I look forward to signing this bill into law and continuing to 
strengthen the U.S.-India strategic partnership.
