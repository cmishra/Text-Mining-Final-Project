    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report one revised deferral of budget authority, 
totaling $1.6 billion, three revised rescission proposals, and 27 new

Security Assistance, are contained in the attached report. The proposed 
rescissions affect International Security Assistance Programs; the 
Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Housing and Urban 
Development, State, Transportation, and the Treasury; the General 
Services Administration; the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration; the Board for International Broadcasting; the National 
Science Foundation; and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
