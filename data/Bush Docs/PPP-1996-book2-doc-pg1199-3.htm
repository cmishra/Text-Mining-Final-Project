Remarks Prior to a Meeting on TWA Flight 800 Recovery Efforts in 
Jamaica, New York
July 25, 1996

[The President's remarks are joined in progress.]

    The President. ----have a briefing from all the folks who have been 
working on this terrible tragedy, making an effort to recover the bodies 
as quickly as possible and find out what caused the crash. And I'm 
looking forward to that briefing and having a chance to thank them for 
the efforts they've made and then to go over and meet with the families.
    I want to thank the Members of the Congress, the Governor, and other 
officials from New York, and particularly the Ambassadors from France 
and Italy for being here with me. And I'm anxious to get on with the 
morning.
    Thank you.
    Q. Are you satisfied with the efforts to recover the bodies even as 
the search for clues as to the cause of this tragedy is underway?

    The President. I will have a statement after we meet this morning, 
and I'd prefer to wait and answer all my questions then.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 9:40 a.m. in Port Authority 
Building 14 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. In his remarks, 
the President referred to Ambassadors Francois Bujon de l'Estang of 
France and Ferdinando Salleo of Italy. A tape was not available for 
verification of the content of these remarks.
