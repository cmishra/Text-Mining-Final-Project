Statement Announcing a Request to Congress for the Establishment of a 
Contingency Reserve Fund
May 5, 2004

    This morning, Secretary Rumsfeld<Rumsfeld, Donald H.<ls-thn-eq> and 
I discussed recommendations from our commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan 
about additional resources that they may require.
    While we do not know the precise costs for operations next year, 
recent developments on the ground and increased demands on our troops 
indicate the need to plan for contingencies. We must make sure there is 
no disruption in funding and resources for our troops.
    I am requesting that Congress establish a $25 billion contingency 
reserve fund for the coming fiscal year to meet all commitments to our 
troops and to make sure we succeed in these critical fronts in the war 
on terror. As my administration has previously said, we will pursue a 
full FY 2005 supplemental request when we can better estimate precise 
costs.
    Our troops in Iraq are performing superbly in their efforts to help 
the Iraqi people realize a free and peaceful future. I have pledged to 
our troops that they will have all the resources they need to get the 
job done, and I look forward to working with Congress on this high 
priority.
