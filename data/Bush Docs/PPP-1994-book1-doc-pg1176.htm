Letter to Members of Congress on Health Care Reform
July 1, 1994

Dear ____________:
    As you leave to celebrate the Fourth of July after weeks of hard 
work, I wanted to point out what a remarkable week this has been on 
health care. When Congress returns after the recess, you will have the 
opportunity to vote to provide guaranteed health coverage to every 
American.
    The Committees have been hard at work, and for the first time ever 
bills guaranteeing universal coverage will be ready to go to the floor. 
We can make history in the month ahead if we listen to the American 
people.
    Look at the events of this week--
  <bullet>  A Washington Post/ABC poll reports that 78% of Americans 
            support universal coverage; 72% support employer 
            responsibility; and 75% support cost containment. The public 
            knows what the health care debate is about.
  <bullet>  The deans of over 70 of our most prestigious medical schools 
            announced their support for universal coverage.
  <bullet>  The Small Business Coalition for Health Care Reform, which 
            supports universal coverage and employer responsibility, 
            announced they have over 625,000 small business members, 
            making it the largest small business coalition in the 
            country, with more members than the National Federation of 
            Independent Business.
  <bullet>  More than 100 big businesses, including 28 of the Fortune 
            100, have announced their support for universal coverage and 
            employer responsibility.
  <bullet>  The American Medical Association, in a full page newspaper 
            ad, added its voice to that of other physician groups, 
            nurses and other providers urging Congress to pass universal 
            coverage and employer responsibility.
  <bullet>  The Wall Street Journal on June 27 reported that the 
            percentage of adults who work but have no public or private 
            health insurance has risen to 17.5% in 1992 from 15.3% in 
            1988.
    We will have the opportunity to give the American people what they 
need and want, and to give the American economy what it needs--
guaranteed private insurance for every American.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Members of the 103d Congress.
