Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Soviet Treaty 
Compliance
May 13, 1993

Dear Mr. President:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    Enclosed are classified and unclassified copies of the report on 
Soviet Treaty Compliance required under condition 7 of the Resolution of 
Ratification for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).
    The judgments included in this report are drawn from reports 
prepared by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and submitted to 
Congress under the provisions of PL 99-145, as amended, and Section 52 
of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act.
    Under the terms set forth in the Resolution of Ratification, this 
report addresses actions of the former Soviet Union which were 
violations or probable violations of the obligations of the SALT I 
Interim Agreement, SALT II, ABM, INF and START Treaties and the ultimate 
resolution of these issues. This report does not address the actions of 
the newly independent states which have succeeded the Soviet Union. In 
contrast to the Soviet Union, the newly independent states have 
demonstrated a substantially improved willingness to adhere to arms 
control obligations and to work with us to resolve problems.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Albert Gore, Jr., President of the 
Senate, and Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations. An original was not available for verification of the content 
of this letter.
