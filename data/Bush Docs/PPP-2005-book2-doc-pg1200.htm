    President Bush. Yesterday was an incredibly sad day for a lot of 
families in London. It's my honor, Ambassador,<Manning, David 
G.<ls-thn-eq> to come and represent our great country in extending our 
condolences to the people of Great Britain. To those who suffer loss of 
life, we pray for God's blessings. For those who are injured, we pray 
for fast healing. The British people are steadfast and strong. Long 
we've admired the great spirit of the--of Londoners and the people of 
Great Britain. Once again that great strength of character is coming 
through.
    Thank you, Ambassador,<Manning, David G.<ls-thn-eq> for letting me 
come by.
    Ambassador David Manning<Manning, David G.<ls-thn-eq> of the United 
Kingdom. Well, Mr. President, could I just say thank you very much, sir, 
for coming straight here from the airplane after the summit at the G-8. 
It's enormously good of you to come here. The gesture is hugely 
appreciated. And can I say to you that we have had the most wonderful 
gestures of support from the Americans over the last 36 hours. We're 
very grateful for that. It's a huge source of comfort, and thank you so 
much for coming today.
    President Bush. Yes, sir.
