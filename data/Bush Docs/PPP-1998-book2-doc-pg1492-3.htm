Statement on Senate Action on Appropriations Legislation
September 1, 1998

    For the past month, I have criticized the House Republican education 
and training budget because it shortchanges America's future. Today I am 
pleased that a bipartisan group of Senators voted to reject parts of the 
extreme House Republican education and training budget and make many--
but not all--of the critical investments in our future that I believe 
are necessary for America to succeed in the 21st century. This afternoon 
the Senate Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee voted to restore full 
funding for home heating and cooling assistance for low-income families 
and summer jobs for disadvantaged youth. Unlike the House Republican 
budget, they voted to make many of the essential investments in our 
children for which I have been fighting.
    The Senate subcommittee, however, did not adequately fund several 
education and training investments that I believe are vitally important 
to our Nation's future. For example, they did not provide the resources 
necessary for us to move forward to ensure that every 8-year-old can 
read on his or her own and every 12-year-old can log on to the 
information superhighway. The Senate bill is a good first step, but 
there is still more work to do.
    I look forward to working with the Senate on this bill to expand 
educational opportunity, improve child care, set voluntary national 
academic standards, protect continuity in critical health programs, and 
help young people in high-poverty areas. Finally, as I have said before, 
Congress must take action to modernize our schools and help provide 
smaller classes with well-qualified teachers.
