Statement on the Massachusetts Building Trades Council Endorsement of 
NAFTA
November 12, 1993

    Today, we saw a profile in courage. Leo Purcell, president of the 
Massachusetts Building Trades Council, endorsed NAFTA in a letter to 
fellow union workers.
    In addition to saying, as I have, that this is a choice between 
change and status quo, Purcell wrote, ``No longer can nations afford to 
build invisible walls at their borders because there are no longer 
national borders to free trade.''
    I applaud Mr. Purcell for his leadership, courage, and vision and 
for his strong confidence in the American worker.

Note: A copy of Mr. Purcell's letter was made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
