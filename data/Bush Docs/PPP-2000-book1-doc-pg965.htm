Statement on the Arrests in the 1963 Bombing of Birmingham's
16th Street Baptist Church
May 18, 2000

    The terrorist bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963 
ended the lives of four young girls and broke the hearts of millions of 
Americans. To this day, the deaths of Denise McNair, Addie Mae Collins, 
Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley stand out as a powerful symbol of 
the terrible toll of racial hatred. I applaud the continuing efforts of 
those who have worked so hard to see to it that justice is done in this 
case. We must not rest until all those responsible for this horrific 
crime are held accountable for what they have done.
