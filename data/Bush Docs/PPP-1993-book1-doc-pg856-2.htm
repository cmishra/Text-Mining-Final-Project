Statement on the Death of John Connally
June 15, 1993

    I was saddened to hear of the death today of former Governor and 
Treasury Secretary John Connally, whose life was one of service to his 
country and of dedication to the principles in which he so passionately 
believed. He will be remembered fondly by his State and his country for 
the work that he did and the person that he was.
