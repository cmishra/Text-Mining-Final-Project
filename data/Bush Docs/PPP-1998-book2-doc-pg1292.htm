Statement on Signing Legislation on Funding for the Disposition of 
Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride
July 21, 1998

    Today I have signed into law S. 2316, a bill designed to help ensure 
that certain funds of the United States Enrichment Corporation will be 
dedicated to the disposition of depleted uranium hexafluoride. I 
strongly support this bill, but note that by virtue of the 
Recommendations Clause of the Constitution, Article II, section 3, the 
Congress may not require the President to recommend legislation to the 
Congress. Therefore, to the extent the bill would infringe upon my 
discretion to determine whether to recommend legislation to the 
Congress, I must treat it as hortatory. In this case, however, I believe 
that the development of proposed legislation by the Secretary of Energy 
furthers important and valuable objectives, and I intend to instruct the 
Secretary to develop proposed legislation for inclusion in my budget 
request for fiscal year 2000.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 21, 1998.

Note: S. 2316, approved July 21, was assigned Public Law No. 105-204.
