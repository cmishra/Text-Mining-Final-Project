Statement on Senator Dale Bumpers' Decision Not To Seek Reelection
June 14, 1997

    I have known and admired Dale Bumpers for over 25 years. He was a 
great Governor, and he has been a great Senator for the people of our 
native State and the entire Nation. We will miss his courage to stand 
against the tide, his vision, and his eloquence. Hillary and I wish him 
and Betty all the best. We will miss him. So will the Senate. So will 
America.
