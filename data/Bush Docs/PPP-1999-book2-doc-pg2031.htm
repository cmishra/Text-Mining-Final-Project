Statement on the Resignation of Michel Camdessus<Camdessus, 
Michel> as Managing Director of the International Monetary 
Fund
November 9, 1999

    Today I want to express my appreciation to Michel Camdessus, who 
announced his intention to resign as Managing Director of the 
International Monetary Fund, for his years of service. Mr. Camdessus 
exhibited strong leadership during his two-plus terms at the IMF. His 
tireless efforts helped contain the fallout from the East Asian economic 
crisis in 1997 and 1998, improve the global financial architecture, 
increase the transparency of the IMF itself, establish ``good 
practices'' for transparency of national governments, and create greater 
focus on debt relief for the world's poorest countries. I will greatly 
miss working with Mr. Camdessus in the international economic policy 
arena and wish him the best in his retirement.
