                                Foreword

    This volume contains my speeches, messages, major statements, and 
press conferences from the first 6 months of 2001. This was a period of 
significant and shared accomplishment on a range of important issues.

    My Administration set out to provide a new tone of civility and 
cooperation. I worked closely with congressional leaders of both parties 
to pass needed reforms.

    Together, we defined an entirely new role for the Federal Government 
in American education. In the past, Federal authorities often imposed 
extensive mandates on States and local schools, without requiring high 
standards and proven outcomes for children. We reversed this approach--
proposing greater local control and authority while expecting measured 
progress for children, proven by regular testing and revealed to 
parents. My education plan rested on a simple principle: Every child 
deserves an equal chance to grow in knowledge and character so that no 
child will be left behind.

    I came to office believing the American people deserved tax relief--
and I submitted a plan that offered more than a trillion and a half 
dollars in tax relief over the next 10 years. This tax relief proposal 
was combined with a plan to fund national priorities while limiting the 
growth in Government spending to a reasonable rate. Having inherited an 
economy that was in recession, it was clear that aggressive action on 
taxes was needed--and we took that action.

    I also came to office believing there is real suffering in the 
shadow of America's affluence, and that we are called by conscience to 
respond. Faith-based and community organizations are meeting human needs 
that no government can hope to address. To assist them in their good 
works, I created the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community 
Initiatives and submitted a plan that would put the Federal Government 
squarely on the side of America's armies of compassion.

    In the first 6 months of my Administration, we made essential 
progress on other key issues. My trade agenda reflected a commitment to 
open markets around the world for the benefit of American workers and to 
provide lower prices and greater choice for American consumers. To 
improve our environment, we accelerated the cleanup of toxic 
brownfields, proposed full funding of the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, and proposed almost five billion dollars over 5 years for the 
upkeep of our national parks. And to offer our seniors better health 
care coverage, I proposed doubling funding for Medicare over the next 
decade and endorsed a framework for its reform. At the core of this 
reform was a plan to make sure that every senior has access to 
affordable prescription drugs and that working families could use 
refundable tax credits to make health insurance more affordable.

    In an address to a Joint Session of Congress on February 27, 2001, I 
said our Nation needs ``a clear strategy to confront the threats of the 
21st century, threats that are more widespread and less certain. They 
range from terrorists who threaten with bombs to tyrants in rogue 
nations intent upon developing weapons of mass destruction.'' To meet 
these emerging threats, I called for a significant increase in our 
defense budget, the development of an effective missile defense, and a 
technological transformation of America's Armed Forces. American 
military strength is the key to preserving peace, protecting human 
dignity, and extending human freedom.

    The Presidency has been called the ``vital center of action.'' It is 
an office of great influence and great responsibilities. Yet the success 
of our Nation ultimately depends on the character of its citizens. 
During my first 6 months in office, while meeting with countless people 
and traveling across our country, I saw the decency, compassion, and 
courage of the American character. Soon these virtues would be tested by 
terrible events.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 43d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period January 20-June 30, 2001. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed

full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Herbert Hoover, 
Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. 
Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, 
George Bush, and William J. Clinton are also included in the Public 
Papers series.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents publication program is under the 
direction of Frances D. McDonald, Managing Editor, Office of the Federal 
Register. The series is produced by the Presidential and Legislative 
Publications Unit, Gwendolyn J. Henderson, Chief. The Chief Editor of 
this book was Karen Howard Ashlin, assisted by Brad Brooks, Gwen H. 
Estep, Kathleen M. Fargey, Stephen J. Frattini, Christopher Gushman, 
Margaret A. Hemmig, Maxine Hill, Alfred Jones, Loretta C. Jones, 
Jennifer S. Mangum, Stacey A. Mulligan, Michael J. Sullivan, and Karen 
A. Thornton.

    The frontispiece and photographs used in the portfolio were supplied 
by the White House Photo Office. The typography and design of the book 
were developed by the Government Printing Office under the direction of 
Bruce R. James, Public Printer.
