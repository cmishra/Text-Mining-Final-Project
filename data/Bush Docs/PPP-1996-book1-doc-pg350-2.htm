Message on the Observance of Saint Patrick's Day, 1996
March 1, 1996

    Warmest greetings to everyone celebrating Saint Patrick's Day.
    On this feast day of the patron saint of Ireland, we remember with 
gratitude the gifts of the Irish people. For generations, the sons and 
daughters of Ireland have come to America seeking a new life and a new 
freedom, bringing with them a deep faith in God, a profound love of 
liberty, and a determination to help shape the American Dream.
    As soldiers and scholars, poets and Presidents, Irish Americans have 
enriched every facet of American society. Today we honor their many 
accomplishments, their vital contributions in building the cities, 
industries, and culture of America, and the long friendship and close 
ties between the United States and Ireland.
    Like millions of Americans, I rejoice in my Irish heritage; and like 
millions of Americans, I pray for lasting peace in the land of our 
ancestors. We must not permit the process of reconciliation in Northern 
Ireland to be destroyed by those who are blinded by the hatreds of the 
past. As we pay tribute to Saint Patrick's enduring message of faith and 
courage, I salute the people of Ireland for their devotion to defeating 
the enemies of peace. In this age of hope and possibility, I am 
confident that their steadfast efforts will be rewarded with lasting 
tranquility and the blessings of a bright future.
    Best wishes to all for a wonderful holiday.

                                                            Bill Clinton
