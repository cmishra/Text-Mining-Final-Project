Statement on Caribbean Basin Initiative and African Growth and 
Opportunity Act Beneficiary Countries
October 2, 2000

    I am pleased to release today a list of countries eligible for trade 
benefits under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and African Growth and 
Opportunity Act, legislation enacted last spring. By expanding our trade 
relationship with 34 sub-Saharan African countries and 24 Caribbean 
Basin countries, we will help promote economic development, alleviate 
global poverty, and create new economic opportunities for American 
workers and businesses. This action truly marks a new era of stronger 
relations between the United States and our friends in the Caribbean, 
Central America, and Africa.

Note: The proclamations are listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
