Remarks Honoring the 2003 National Basketball Association Champion San 
Antonio Spurs
October 14, 2003

    The President. Thank you all for coming. Thank you. Please be 
seated. Welcome. To all you San Antonio Spurs fans, we're glad you're 
here in the Rose Garden. I'm particularly glad the San Antonio Spurs are 
here today. We want to congratulate you on a fantastic championship run.
    I first want to welcome my friend Peter Holt,<Holt, Peter<ls-thn-eq> 
who turned out to be a pretty darn good owner. [Laughter] It's more than 
I can say for the former Ranger ownership. [Laughter] But 
congratulations, Peter, to you and your organization. I want to thank 
R.C. Buford,<Buford, R.C.<ls-thn-eq> who is the general manager, and 
Gregg Popovich,<Popovich, Gregg<ls-thn-eq> who is the manager of--the 
coach of the club. And I want to welcome the players and your wives and 
friends and family here. After this is over, I'd like to invite you in 
the Oval Office and let you see where the decisions are made that affect 
the peace and freedom of this world.
    I want to welcome some huge San Antonio Spurs fans: Senator John 
Cornyn<Cornyn, John<ls-thn-eq> from San Antonio; Lamar Smith<Smith, 
Lamar<ls-thn-eq> and Henry Bonilla<Bonilla, Henry<ls-thn-eq> as well 
from San Antonio. You got to know that during the playoffs, these guys 
were touting the Spurs. They were giving a pretty hefty line to anybody 
who dared bet against the Spurs, and you didn't let them down. So 
welcome. I'm glad you're here.
    Danny Ferry<Ferry, Danny<ls-thn-eq> is here. Where is Danny Ferry?
    Audience member. He's there.
    The President. Yes, there he<Ferry, Danny<ls-thn-eq> is. He and I 
share an interesting relationship. As you may know, his father, 
Bob,<Ferry, Bob<ls-thn-eq> won the NBA Championship ring. And so Danny 
and Bob Ferry are only the second father/son combination to ever win a 
championship ring--[laughter]--if you get my drift. [Laughter] We're 
members of the famous fathers club. [Laughter] And anyway, I want to 
welcome you here. You'll see where the--only the second son of a 
President office is in a minute. [Laughter]
    I also--one of the things that happens when a championship team 
comes here, it gives me a chance to talk about the development of a 
culture, a winning culture inside an organization. I like to call it a 
culture of service, people being willing to serve something greater than 
themself, in this case, a team.
    I was struck by Tim Duncan's<Duncan, Tim<ls-thn-eq> comments after 
the sixth game when they were talking about the fantastic individual 
effort he had. And a reporter said, ``What about that effort?'' He said, 
``It's cool,'' but then immediately went on to talk about the 
accomplishments of his teammates, recognizing that you can't win a 
championship unless you're able to rely upon others and lift others up 
and participate with others and work hard with others. And it's a 
phenomenal tribute to the San Antonio Spurs that they've got such great 
individual players who are willing to work as a team. And it's a 
wonderful example for our country--it really is.
    The other thing that struck me about this organization that is so 
powerful is that there is a culture of service when it comes

to utilizing their positions as champs to make somebody else's life 
better. Gregg Popovich<Popovich, Gregg<ls-thn-eq> won a Point of Light 
for his drug--anti-drug programs in the early nineties. What a class act 
that must be for players to work for a coach who then takes time out of 
his private life to set a good example for the children of the community 
in which he lives and to work to rally the armies of compassion to make 
somebody else's life better, in this case to help a community fight off 
the scourge of drugs.
    Or David Robinson,<Robinson, David<ls-thn-eq> who is now heavily 
involved in education in the San Antonio community. He's not only a 
great husband but a great role model for others to see. I know many of 
you all do the same thing in your communities, that you care deeply 
about the lives of your fellow citizens, and I want to congratulate you. 
I think you're champs because you understand that serving something 
greater than yourself is the road to championships. And that's what 
you're here to do, is to receive the accolades from our country for 
serving as not only great athletes but as great role models for children 
who look up to you.
    So welcome to the Rose Garden. Congratulations on such a great, 
successful season. And may God continue to bless you, and may God 
continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 10:56 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Peter Holt, chairman and chief 
executive officer, R.C. Buford, general manager, Gregg Popovich, head 
coach, Danny Ferry, director of basketball operations, Tim Duncan, 
center, and David Robinson, retired center, San Antonio Spurs; and 
Representatives Lamar Smith and Henry Bonilla of Texas.
