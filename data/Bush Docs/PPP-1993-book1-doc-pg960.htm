Nomination for the Federal Communications Commission
June 29, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate attorney 
Reed E. Hundt as a member of the Federal Communications Commission. Once 
Mr. Hundt is confirmed as a member, the President intends to designate 
him Chairman of the FCC.
    ``Telecommunications innovations are constantly changing the way we 
as Americans communicate with each other and with the world. With his 
years of experience, I am confident Reed Hundt will do an excellent job 
steering the FCC through the challenges it will face over the next 5 
years,'' the President said.

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
