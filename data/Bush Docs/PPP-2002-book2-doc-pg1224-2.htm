Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Requesting Funds 
for the Disaster Relief Program of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency
July 12, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    In accordance with provisions of Public Law 107-73, the Departments 
of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002, I hereby request and make available 
$500 million for the disaster relief program of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA).
    These funds would allow FEMA to continue providing assistance to 
victims of disasters in several States, including victims of recent 
flooding in Texas and wild fires in Arizona and Colorado. These funds 
would also be available for ongoing response to prior disasters and to 
ensure that FEMA has resources on hand to provide timely response to 
future disasters.
    I designate the funds made available today as an emergency 
requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and 
Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.
    The details of this action are set forth in the attached letter from 
the Director of Management and Budget. I concur with his comments and 
observations.
        Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
