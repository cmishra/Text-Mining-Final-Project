Remarks at the North Atlantic Council Summit in Prague
November 21, 2002

    America is very pleased by today's decision. We believe it 
strengthens our Nation's most important alliance, NATO. By welcoming 
seven members, we will not only add to our military capabilities; we 
will refresh the spirit of this great democratic Alliance.
    We believe today's decision reaffirms our commitment to freedom and 
our commitment to a Europe which is whole and free and at peace.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:03 a.m. at the Prague Congress Center.
