Statement on House of Representatives Action on Child Support 
Legislation
September 7, 2000

    I commend the House of Representatives for its broad bipartisan 
approval today of the child support distribution act. Vice President 
Gore and I are committed to promoting responsible fatherhood and making 
sure more child support goes directly to children, and this bill is an 
important step toward achieving these goals.
    This legislation, which is similar in many ways to my 
administration's child support budget proposals, allows States to pass 
through more child support payments directly to families and simplifies 
child support distribution rules. Like our fathers work/families win 
initiative, this bill also provides grants to help low-income fathers 
and families work, pay child support, and reconnect with their children. 
These initiatives build on our longstanding commitment to strengthen the 
role of fathers in their children's lives.
    I encourage the Senate to take up this important legislation this 
year, and I look forward to working with the Congress across party lines 
to ensure that more fathers can honor their responsibilities and more 
children can receive both the emotional and financial support they need.
