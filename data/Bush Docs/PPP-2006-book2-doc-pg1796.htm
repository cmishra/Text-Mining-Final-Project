Statement on the Death of John J. ``Buck'' O'Neil<O'Neil, John J. 
``Buck''<ls-thn-eq>
October 7, 2006

    Buck O'Neil represented the best of America's national pastime. He 
devoted his long and full life to baseball and refused to allow 
injustice and discrimination to diminish his love of the game and his 
joyous, generous spirit. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I extend our 
sympathies to his family and friends, and on behalf of all Americans, we 
give thanks for the life of one of the great ambassadors in baseball 
history.
