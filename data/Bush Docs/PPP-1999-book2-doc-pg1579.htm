Remarks Prior to Discussions With Chairman Yasser Arafat<Arafat, 
Yasser> of the Palestinian Authority and an Exchange With 
Reporters
September 23, 1999

Middle East Peace Process

    The President. Let me say, I am delighted to see Chairman Arafat 
again. We have a lot to discuss, obviously, about our bilateral 
relations, and especially about the permanent status talks. He and Prime 
Minister Barak<Barak, Ehud> have agreed on a very ambitious 
timetable to have a framework agreement by February, final agreement by 
next September. The United States is prepared to do all we can to assist 
them in coming to an agreement.
    I would like to take this opportunity to say that we should first 
meet our own obligations under the Wye agreement, and I hope the 
Congress will give me the funding, both for Israel and for the 
Palestinian Authority, so that we can meet our obligations there. And 
we're working hard. We're into the final budget legs now, and I'm quite 
hopeful.

Permanent Status Talks

    Q. Mr. President, what did Chairman Arafat ask you vis-a-vis the 
permanent status talks? Did he ask you for a more active role, more 
involvement, sir?
    The President. We're just starting--we're getting off to a late 
start, so we're just starting our conversation. But you know, I've been 
active in this all along for 6\1/2\ years now. I intend to continue to 
be active, to do whatever I can to help the parties come to an 
agreement. If they're willing--and they must be willing, or they would 
not have agreed to such an ambitious timetable--then I'll do what I can.

Israel-Syria Negotiations

    Q. [Inaudible]--about the Palestinian-Israeli track? Prime Minister 
Barak said just yesterday, any time, any place, for the Syrians to 
resume negotiations. There has yet to be any positive response there. 
What's your sense of what the hangup is there, and what can you do to 
try to move that along?
    The President. Well, we're working on it, and I actually am quite 
hopeful.

President's Involvement in the Peace Process

    Q. Mr. President, is there a chance that you'll visit the area, to 
give it a push on both tracks?
    The President. I would do anything that would be helpful to 
facilitate the agreement. Right now, I'm not sure that would be the most 
helpful thing. I would do anything I could to facilitate the agreement.

Palestinian State

    Q. The question of the state of Palestine, Mr. President, are you 
willing to spend more capital and secure your legacy as the President of 
the United States who achieved the Palestinian state and the peaceful 
settlement of the Middle East?
    The President. Well, I'm certainly willing to do anything I can to 
achieve a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. The question of the 
state, as you know--that was a very well-worded question. 
Congratulations. [Laughter] But the question of the state is one to be 
resolved in the permanent status talks that have just begun, so I think 
they will resolve it. I think, obviously, that the two sides will make 
an agreement on that, or there won't be an agreement.
    Press Secretary<Lockhart, Joseph> Joe Lockhart. Thank you, 
pool.
    Q. Mr. President, what can you tell us----
    Q. Mr. President, in your U.N. speech----

Israel's Role in the Peace Process

    Q. [Inaudible]--what can you tell us about the performance of the 
Israeli side so far in the last one month?
    The President. I'm encouraged. I think you should all be encouraged 
by the work that they've done together.
    Press Secretary<Lockhart, Joseph> Lockhart. Thank you, 
everyone.
    The President. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 4:10 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of 
Israel. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
these remarks.
