Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency 
Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting the Importation of 
Certain Goods from Liberia
July 19, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with the provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication stating that the 
national emergency and related measures blocking the property of certain 
persons and prohibiting the importation of certain goods from Liberia 
are to continue in effect beyond July 22, 2005.
    The actions and policies of former Liberian President Charles 
Taylor<Taylor, Charles<ls-thn-eq> and other persons, in particular their 
unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their removal from Liberia 
and secreting of Liberian funds and property, continue to undermine 
Liberia's transition to democracy and the orderly development of its 
political, administrative, and economic institutions and resources. 
These actions and policies pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the foreign policy of the United States. For these reasons, I 
have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency 
and related measures blocking the property of certain persons and 
prohibiting the importation of certain goods from Liberia.

                                                          George W. Bush

The White House,

July 19, 2005.
