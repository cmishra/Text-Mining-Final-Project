Remarks on the EgyptAir Flight 990 Aircraft Tragedy and an Exchange With 
Reporters
October 31, 1999

    The President. Like all Americans, Hillary and I are very saddened 
by the crash of the EgyptAir flight off the coast of Massachusetts. We 
are working on the recovery efforts. We know there has been an extensive 
loss of life, and we don't yet know what caused the accident. So I 
really think I can't say any more now, except----
    Q. Have you talked with anyone, sir?
    The President. Only our people. They've briefed me. But we don't 
know, we don't know what the cause of the accident is. We'll keep 
working until we find out.
    Q. Concerns about foul play, sir?
    The President. We don't know. We have no evidence of that at this 
time, and I think it's better if people draw no conclusions until we 
know something.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 12:15 p.m. outside Foundry United Methodist 
Church following church services. A tape was not available for 
verification of the content of these remarks.
