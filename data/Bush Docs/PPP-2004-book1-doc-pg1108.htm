Remarks at a Reception for Black Music Month
June 22, 2004

    Thanks for coming, and welcome to the White House. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I really appreciate you coming to join us today to 
celebrate Black Music Month, and we're glad you're here.
    Our Jazz Masters and students from the Jazz in the New Generation 
program will perform for us soon, and we thank them for being here as 
well. I think you're going to like it. [Laughter] It's actually one of 
the great advantages of being the President is you get some great 
musicians to play for you in your living room. [Laughter]
    We want to thank Dana Gioia<Gioia, Dana<ls-thn-eq> for coming here. 
He's the chairman of the National Endowment of Arts. He's doing a fine 
job. I appreciate you being here.
    I see members of my Cabinet who are here. Secretary of Agriculture 
Ann Veneman<Veneman, Ann M.<ls-thn-eq> is joining us. Thank you, Ann, 
for coming. And the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso 
Jackson<Jackson, Alphonso R.<ls-thn-eq> and his wife, Marcia,<Jackson, 
Marcia<ls-thn-eq> I appreciate you both being here. I want to thank 
Congressman Chris Shays<Shays, Christopher<ls-thn-eq> from the great 
State of Connecticut for joining us. Thank you, and

thank you for bringing Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> back safely last 
night. [Laughter]
    I appreciate Bill Coleman,<Coleman, William T., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> the 
former Secretary of Transportation under Gerald Ford,<Ford, Gerald R., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> for joining us today. Mr. Secretary, thank you for 
coming.
    I want to thank Dr. Billy Taylor,<Taylor, Billy<ls-thn-eq> Jazz 
Master 1988, and the Billy Taylor Trio for being here today. Thank you 
all for coming. Honored you're here. I want to thank Jazz Master 2004, 
Chico Hamilton,<Hamilton, Chico<ls-thn-eq> for joining us today. Thank 
you for coming. James Moody,<Moody, James<ls-thn-eq> Jazz Master 1998, 
thank you for coming. Of course, Jazz in the New Generation students, 
who will be introduced shortly. I appreciate David Baker,<Baker, David 
N., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Jazz Master 2000, for joining us as well. Proud 
you're being here.
    During this month, we recognize the great contribution that black 
music has made to the culture of our Nation and to the world. This music 
could only have come from the unique experience of African Americans, 
yet it speaks to every human heart. Black music in America began with 
spiritual songs that bore witness to the cruelty of bondage and the 
strength of faith. From those roots, it grew into a variety of styles, 
jazz and gospel, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll. All these forms 
capture a part of the American spirit.
    It's impossible to imagine American music without Louis Armstrong 
and Duke Ellington, Mahalia Jackson and Billie Holiday, Lionel Hampton 
or B.B. King,<King, Riley B. ``B.B.''<ls-thn-eq> Stevie Wonder<Wonder, 
Steveland ``Stevie'' Morris<ls-thn-eq> and Aretha Franklin,<Franklin, 
Aretha<ls-thn-eq> and countless others. It's just impossible to imagine 
American music without them, isn't it?
    Recently, we've lost two of our greatest African American musicians. 
Last month, the celebrated jazz drummer Elvin Jones passed away. He was 
the fiery pulse of John Coltrane's Quartet. Elvin Jones loved music so 
much that rather than spend his last days in the hospital, he brought an 
oxygen tank on stage with him, so he could keep amazing his audiences 
until the very end.
    And just days ago we said goodbye to another American original, Ray 
Charles, who's often called ``the father of soul music,'' but his music 
embraced every style and transcended every label. It takes a great 
talent to make a song forever your own, and no one hears ``Georgia On My 
Mind'' or ``Hit the Road, Jack'' without thinking of Ray 
Charles.<Robinson, Ray Charles<ls-thn-eq> When he was 15, his mother, 
Aretha, told him just before her death, ``You might not be able to do 
things like a person who can see, but there are always two ways to do 
everything, and you've just got to find the other way.'' Well, Ray 
found--Ray Charles found the other way, a beautiful way, and it was our 
privilege to witness it.
    Though an older generation leaves us, their legacy lives on in many 
talented young African American musicians of today: Gospel singers like 
Kirk Franklin<Franklin, Kirk<ls-thn-eq> and Yolanda<Adams, 
Yolanda<ls-thn-eq> Adams--I might add, both from Texas--[laughter]--
bright jazz talents like Roy Hargrove,<Hargrove, Roy<ls-thn-eq> Mark 
Turner,<Turner, Mark<ls-thn-eq> Joshua Redman;<Redman, Joshua<ls-thn-eq> 
pop artists like Alicia Keys.<Keys, Alicia<ls-thn-eq> And of course, 
there's<Marsalis, Branford<ls-thn-eq> a<Marsalis, Wynton<ls-thn-eq> 
Marsalis<Marsalis, Delfeayo<ls-thn-eq> brother<Marsalis, 
Jason<ls-thn-eq> for just about every instrument. [Laughter] These 
performers and many others carry forward the tradition of black music in 
our country. We take great pride in this heritage. We're grateful to 
every musician who keeps that heritage so rich and so vital today.
    And so I've signed a proclamation designating June 2004 as Black 
Music Month in the United States of America. It's a way we honor this 
important part of our heritage.
    I'm going to turn things over now to the Chairman of the National 
Endowment of the Arts, Dana Gioia,<Gioia, Dana<ls-thn-eq> who will tell 
us about the Jazz Masters program and introduce our performers. Before 
he comes up here, I want you to know that he jokes he's the only person 
ever to have gone to Stanford Business School to become a poet. 
[Laughter] He can explain that for himself. [Laughter] He's doing a 
great job as the NEA Chairman. Welcome, Dana Gioia.
