Nomination for Deputy Administrator of the General Services 
Administration
May 19, 1993

    The President today named nationally recognized Chicago 
businesswoman Julia Stasch Deputy Administrator of the General Services 
Administration. Ms. Stasch joins Administrator-designee and former 
Western Digital CEO Roger Johnson at the head of GSA.
    ``Julia Stasch is exactly the type of aggressive and innovative 
business person this administration needs as it seeks to reinvent the 
way Government works,'' the President said. ``I am confident Julia will 
work well with Roger Johnson to ensure economy and efficiency are 
standard rule at the new GSA.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
