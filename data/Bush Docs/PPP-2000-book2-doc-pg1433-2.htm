Statement on Senate Action on Proposed Legislation for Critical Lands 
Protection Funding
July 14, 2000

    I am pleased that a bipartisan agreement was reached today in the 
Senate on legislation to provide permanent funding to protect critical 
lands across America. We have before us an historic opportunity to build 
a truly enduring conservation endowment. I commend Senator 
Bingaman<Bingaman, Jeff> and Senator Murkowski<Murkowski, 
Frank H.> for their leadership in moving us closer to that 
goal. I am committed to working with Congress in the bipartisan spirit 
reflected in today's agreement so that future generations will have the 
resources to protect precious lands, from city parks to threatened 
farmland to our grandest natural treasures.
