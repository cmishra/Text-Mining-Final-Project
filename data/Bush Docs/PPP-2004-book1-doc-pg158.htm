    Q. Mr. President----
    The President. Now what was that look for?
    Q. I'm wondering what you think of John Kerry, sir?

start your own business, like these people here have done.
    Q. Mr. President, what about consternation over weapons of mass 
destruction?

[At this point, the President continued his tour of the chocolate shop.]

owners,<Anderson, Theresa<ls-thn-eq> right here. They started their 
business last year. Had a dream, living their dream, and they're making 
good product. And I expect people in the national press corps to leave 
some cash behind. [Laughter]
    That would be you, Allen<Allen, Mike<ls-thn-eq> [Mike Allen, 
Washington Post]. Go buy some--[laughter]--they'll help you, right over 
there. [Laughter]

Note: The exchange began at approximately 3:45 p.m. at Swan Chocolates.
