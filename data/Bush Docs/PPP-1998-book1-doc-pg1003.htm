Statement on Handgun Control Legislation
June 21, 1998

    The Justice Department's report on background checks is further 
proof that the Brady law is working. Since its passage, law enforcement 
officials have stopped hundreds of thousands of felons, fugitives, and 
stalkers from buying handguns every year. By keeping guns out of the 
hands of criminals--and putting more police in our communities--we have 
helped cut the crime rate to its lowest point in a generation. We must 
now extend the Brady law's provisions to violent juveniles and bar them 
from owning guns for life. I call on Congress once again to pass this 
needed, commonsense legislation.

Note: This statement was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on June 19 but was embargoed for release until 4:30 p.m. on 
June 21.
