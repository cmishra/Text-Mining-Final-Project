Statement on the Anniversary of the Bombing of Pan American Flight 103
December 21, 1996

    On this day 8 years ago, Pan American Flight 103 was savagely torn 
from the skies over Lockerbie, Scotland. We have not forgotten the 270 
victims who perished in that cowardly act

of terrorism. And we have not forgotten their families. On behalf of the 
American people, we remember your loss today. We draw strength from your 
dignity and your courage. You are not alone in your determination to see 
that the perpetrators of this evil deed are brought to justice. Your 
country stands with you and shares your continuing grief.
    The sponsors of terrorism hope that with the passing of time the 
world will forget their crimes. We will not forget. Time has not 
diminished our outrage, and it never will. We are determined to see that 
those who committed these murders are brought to justice. That is why we 
continue to demand the extradition of the two Libyans who have been 
indicted for this vicious offense to stand trial in the U.S. or U.K. It 
is also why we have pushed for and secured tough international sanctions 
against Libya that we strengthened further with legislation in 1996. We 
will not rest until this case is closed and justice is done.

Note: This statement was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on December 20, but it was embargoed for release until 
December 21, the anniversary date of the bombing.
