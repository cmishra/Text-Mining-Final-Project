Letter to the Attorney General Directing Action on the Labor Disputes 
Affecting Pacific Coast Ports
October 8, 2002

Dear Mr. Attorney General:
    On October 7, 2002, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (61 Stat. 155; 
29 U.S.C. 176) (the ``Act''), I issued Executive Order 13275. That Order 
created a Board of Inquiry to report on certain labor disputes affecting 
the maritime industry of the United States.
    Today, I received the Board's written report in the matter. A copy 
of the report is attached. In my opinion, this unresolved labor dispute 
has resulted in a lock-out affecting a substantial part of the maritime 
industry of the United States, an industry that is engaged in trade, 
commerce, transportation (including the transportation of military 
supplies), transmission, and communication among the several States and 
with foreign nations. This lock-out, if permitted to continue, will 
imperil the national health and safety.
    Therefore, in order to eliminate this peril and to secure the 
resumption of trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, and 
communication among the several States and with foreign nations, I 
direct you, pursuant to the provisions of section 208 of the Act, to 
petition in the name of the United States in any District Court of the 
United States having jurisdiction of the parties to enjoin the lock-out 
(or its continuance) and for such other relief as may in your judgment 
be appropriate.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
