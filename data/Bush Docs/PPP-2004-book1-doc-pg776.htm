Message on the Observance of Cinco de Mayo, 2004
May 5, 2004

    I send greetings to those celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
    On May 5, 1862, Mexican soldiers held back an invading army at the 
Battle of Puebla. This victory played a decisive role in the eventual 
expulsion of foreign forces from Mexico in 1867. Led by Texas-born 
Mexican General Ignacio Zaragoza, a small outnumbered militia of 
freedom-loving soldiers halted the invasion of their country. One 
hundred forty-two years after this victory, Cinco de Mayo pays tribute 
to the bravery and victory of General Zaragoza's soldiers and the 
strong, independent spirit of the Mexican people.
    This observance is also a time to celebrate the strong friendship 
between the United States and Mexico. More than neighbors, we are 
partners in building a safer, more democratic, and more prosperous 
hemisphere. The United States continues to share close ties of family, 
culture, and history with Mexico and the Mexican people, and we 
recognize the vital role Mexican Americans play in shaping our Nation. 
We look forward to a future of continued friendship and collaboration 
with Mexico as we work to advance peace and democracy in the world.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a joyous celebration.

                                                          George W. Bush
