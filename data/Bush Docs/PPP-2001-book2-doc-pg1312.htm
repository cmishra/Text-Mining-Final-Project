Statement on the Death of Gerry Solomon<Solomon, Gerald B.H.>
October 26, 2001

    Gerry Solomon was a true patriot. A decorated veteran of the U.S. 
Marine Corps, he was a tireless advocate of the men and women of the 
United States military who continued to work to protect the interests of 
America's veterans long after his service in the U.S. Congress ended. 
Gerry Solomon will always be remembered as true to his creed: duty, 
honor, country.
