Statement on the Death of Jack J. Valenti<Valenti, Jack J.<ls-thn-eq>
April 26, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by Jack Valenti's 
death. Jack Valenti was a great American and a great Texan. He bravely 
flew combat missions during World War II and ably served in the White 
House. From protecting families by creating the movie rating system to 
advocating for intellectual property rights, Jack Valenti helped 
transform the motion picture industry. He leaves a powerful legacy in 
Washington, in Hollywood, and across our Nation.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with Jack's wife Mary 
Margaret,<Valenti, Mary M. Wiley<ls-thn-eq> his<Valenti, 
Courtenay<ls-thn-eq> children,<Valenti, Alexandra<ls-thn-eq> 
and<Valenti, John<ls-thn-eq> his friends and colleagues.
