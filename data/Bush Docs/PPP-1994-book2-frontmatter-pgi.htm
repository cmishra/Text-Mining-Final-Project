                                Foreword

    During the second half of 1994, America continued to move forward to 
help strengthen the American Dream of prosperity here at home and help 
spread peace and democracy around the world.

    The American people saw the rewards that grew out of our efforts in 
the first 18 months of my Administration. Economic growth increased in 
strength, and the number of new jobs created during my Administration 
rose to 4.7 million. After 6 years of delay, the American people had a 
Crime Bill, which will put 100,000 police officers on our streets and 
take 19 deadly assault weapons off the street. We saw our National 
Service initiative become a reality as I swore in the first 20,000 
AmeriCorps members, giving them the opportunity to serve their country 
and to earn money for their education. I signed the Community 
Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994, which will 
make capital available to Americans who have been denied access to basic 
banking services for far too long.

    As we gave our citizens the means to make America stronger at home, 
we also continued our efforts to assert American leadership in the 
world. The Congress passed and I signed the implementing legislation for 
the Uruguay Round Agreement of the GATT, the most comprehensive 
international trade agreement in history. It helped to put in place 
expanded export oppportunities for American products that will create 
more jobs and produce higher incomes for our people for years to come. I 
travelled to Indonesia for a meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic 
Cooperation forum in order to expand free trade with the world's most 
dynamic economies. In December, at the Summit of the Americas in Miami, 
the leaders of the 34 democratically elected countries in this 
hemisphere agreed to negotiate on a free trade area for the Americas by 
2005, to work together to preserve our natural resources, and to advance 
democracy and social justice, holding out promise of greater prosperity 
throughout the hemisphere.

    The United States also continued to help bring an end to ancient 
disputes around the world. We actively supported the efforts of the 
people of Northern Ireland to work toward a peaceful resolution after 
many years of conflict. Building on our work to bring peace to the 
Middle East, I had the great privilege to witness the signing of an 
historic peace treaty between Israel and Jordan. And closer to home, in 
our own hemisphere, America took active steps to promote democracy. Our 
Armed Forces again proved their strength, flexibility, and devotion to 
freedom as they helped give a second chance to the long-suffering people 
of Haiti, and renewed hope to freedom-loving people throughout the 
world.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period August 1-December 31, 1994. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush are 
also available.
