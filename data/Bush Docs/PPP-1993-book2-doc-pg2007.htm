Nomination for Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
November 17, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate Ricki 
Rhodarmer Tigert to be Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation. If confirmed by the Senate, Tigert would be the first woman 
to head a Federal banking agency.
    ``Ricki Tigert is highly qualified for this position, with broad-
based experience in both the executive and legislative branches of the 
Federal Government, as well as at the Federal Reserve,'' said the 
President. ``Her 15 years of private and public sector experience in 
banking and financial issues have prepared her well for the important 
task of safeguarding the savings of millions of American bank 
depositors.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
