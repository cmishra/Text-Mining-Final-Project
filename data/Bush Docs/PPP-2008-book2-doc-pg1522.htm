January 7, 2009

    Thank you all.<Bush, George H.W.<ls-thn-eq> Mr. President--
[laughter]--yes? No--[laughter]. Thank you all for coming. I'm told 
there is seven speakers. So there's now about to be six. I thank you 
for--I welcome you to the White House. I hope you take advantage of the 
reception that we have after these seven short speeches. And I want to 
thank you for your compassion.
    The strength of America is not our military, it's not our wallet, it 
is--lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens, those who hear the 
universal call to love a neighbor just like they'd like to be loved 
themselves.
    And so for those of you who are rallying the armies of compassion, 
and encouraging the armies of compassion, we thank you.
    And now it is my honor to introduce my brother Neil M. Bush.<Bush, 
Neil M.<ls-thn-eq>
