Statement on the Death of Representative Herbert H. Bateman<Bateman, 
Herbert H.>
September 11, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of 
Congressman Herbert Bateman.
    For more than 30 years, Herb Bateman served the people of Virginia 
with honor and distinction. As a veteran of the Air Force and a Member 
of the U.S. House of Representatives, he worked to support our Armed 
Forces and was a strong advocate of fiscal discipline and a balanced 
budget.
    Herb Bateman was a fine man and dedicated public servant who will be 
missed by many. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Laura, their 
family, and their friends.
