Statement on the Election of Sandra Feldman as President of the 
American Federation of Teachers
May 6, 1997

    In electing Sandra Feldman president, the American Federation of 
Teachers has chosen someone who has already proven herself as a dynamic 
leader and superb educator. I've visited schools with her in New York 
and have seen first-hand the respect that teachers and students have for 
her. I share that respect.
    Like her predecessor, Al Shanker, Sandra Feldman is an outstanding 
advocate for our Nation's students. I look forward to working with her 
on a variety of issues that will improve the quality of education our 
children receive, including making high standards a reality in every 
American public school.
