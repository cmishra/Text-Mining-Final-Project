Statement on Signing the 13th Continuing Resolution
April 24, 1996

    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 175, the Thirteenth 
Continuing Resolution for fiscal year 1996.
    House Joint Resolution 175 provides for a temporary extension of 
appropriations--through April 25--for activities covered by the five 
fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills that have not been enacted into 
law.
    It is my hope that this very brief extension will enable the 
Congress to complete acceptable legislation to fund these activities for 
the remainder of the fiscal year.
    When the fiscal 1996 process is complete, we should resume our 
efforts to achieve a balanced budget. A balanced budget that is 
consistent with our Nation's values should be our ultimate goal. I am 
determined to continue working toward that goal.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

April 24, 1996.

Note: H.J. Res. 175, approved April 24, was assigned Public Law No. 104-
131.
