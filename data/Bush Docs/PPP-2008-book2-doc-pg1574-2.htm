Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency 
Relating to Cuba and of the Emergency Authority Relating to the 
Regulation of the Anchorage and Movement of Vessels
January 15, 2009

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the national emergency declared with respect to the Government of Cuba's 
destruction of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba on February 24, 1996, as amended 
and expanded on February 26, 2004, is to continue in effect beyond March 
1, 2009.

                                                          George W. Bush
