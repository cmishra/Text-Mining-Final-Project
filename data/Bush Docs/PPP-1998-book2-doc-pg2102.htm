Statement on the Death of Dante B. Fascell
November 30, 1998

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of former Florida 
Congressman Dante Fascell. Just last month, I had the privilege to award 
Congressman Fascell with the Medal of Freedom for his 38 years of 
dedicated public service in the U.S. House of Representatives.
    Dante Fascell contributed immeasurably to America's national 
security, to our leadership in the global economy, and to our quality of 
life. He demonstrated an unwavering commitment to civil rights, 
environmental protection, and openness in Government. Dante served as 
the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for 9 years, 
supporting emerging democracies, pressing for arms control, and 
promoting fair trade and dialog among nations. His achievements are a 
testament to his vision and leadership. We will miss this true hero, 
whose selfless conduct as a public servant set a shining example for all 
Americans. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Jeanne-Marie, 
his two children, and the entire Fascell family.
