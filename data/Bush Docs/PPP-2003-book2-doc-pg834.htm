Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Benchmarks for 
a Sustainable Peace Process in Bosnia and Herzegovina
July 3, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with the Levin Amendment to the 1998 Supplemental 
Appropriations and Rescissions Act (section 7(b) of Public Law 105-174) 
and section 1203(a) of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I am providing a report 
prepared by my Administration on progress made toward achieving 
benchmarks for a sustainable peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
    This eighth report, which also includes supplemental reporting 
consistent with section 1203(a) of Public Law 105-261, provides an 
updated assessment of progress on the benchmarks covering the period 
January 1 to June 30, 2003.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
