Statement on Signing the Russian Democracy Act of 2002
October 23, 2002

    I have today signed into law H.R. 2121, the ``Russian Democracy Act 
of 2002.'' This Act seeks to promote democracy, the rule of law, and an 
independent media in the Russian Federation.
    Section 3(b) of the Act purports to establish U.S. policy towards 
Russia. My approval of the Act does not constitute my adoption of the 
statements of policy in section 3(b) as U.S. foreign policy. Given the 
Constitution's commitment to the presidency of the authority to conduct 
the Nation's foreign affairs, the executive branch shall construe such 
policy statements as advisory, giving them the due weight that comity 
between the legislative and executive branches should require, to the 
extent consistent with U.S. foreign policy.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 October 23, 2002.

Note: H.R. 2121, approved October 23, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
246.
