Message on the Observance of Independence Day, 1994
June 27, 1994

    As we celebrate July 4, a momentous and magnificent day in our 
nation's history, we give thanks for the liberties that our courageous 
Founders struggled to secure. Declaring the American colonies 
independent and free, these brave patriots risked everything they held 
dear to ensure a better future for their children and grandchildren. 
Today, we fiercely defend the once radical notion that each individual 
possesses rights that our government is obliged to respect and to 
guarantee. The powerful ideals for which the Founders fought have become 
standards of citizenship around the world.
    Our country's Founders gave of themselves to create a better future. 
As heirs to their legacy, we can do no less. If we are truly to pay 
tribute to them, we must rededicate ourselves to using our precious 
freedoms with renewed responsibility. We must work together to rebuild 
our neighborhoods and bring healing to our torn families and 
communities. We must strive to end the violence that plagues our society 
and to give our children the chance to grow up in safe and supportive 
environments. On our nation's birthday, let us rededicate ourselves to 
making those choices in the same way Thomas Jefferson and his 
compatriots did so many years ago--with a hopeful eye toward the future.
    Best wishes to all for a wonderful holiday.

                                                            Bill Clinton
