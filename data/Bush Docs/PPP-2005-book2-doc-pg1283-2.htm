 Statement on Congressional Action on Highway Legislation
 July 29, 2005

     I congratulate the Congress for completing a highway bill that will 
improve highway safety, modernize our roads, reduce traffic congestion, 
and create jobs. I am pleased that Congress met these objectives in a 
fiscally responsible way and without raising gas taxes. This important 
legislation will help provide the funding needed to carry out overdue 
work on critical highway and transportation projects, and it will 
strengthen and modernize the transportation networks vital to America's 
continued economic growth. I look forward to signing it into law.
