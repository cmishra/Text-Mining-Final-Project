Memorandum on the Presidential Design Awards Program
September 23, 1998

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Presidential Design Awards Program

    The strength of our economy and quality of life in America owe much 
to the genius and creativity of designers. From using simple brick and 
mortar to developing sophisticated computers, designers have turned the 
dreams of the Nation into reality.
    As the single largest purchaser of design services, the Federal 
Government has been a leader in fostering design excellence. Begun in 
1983, the quadrennial Presidential Design Awards Program recognizes 
successful achievements in Federal design and promotes standards of 
excellence throughout the Federal Government. By this memorandum, I am 
pleased to announce the call for entries for the next round of awards. 
This round will include special Presidential Design Excellence 
Millennium Awards in recognition of Federal design projects that have 
made a significant contribution to the environment and quality of life 
of the Nation during this century.
    The National Endowment for the Arts and the General Services 
Administration will implement the Presidential Design Awards Program. 
Please designate an individual with an appropriate background and 
position to serve as your liaison to ensure the success of this 
important program. Good design combines problem solving with cost-
effectiveness and performance with beauty, and I urge all agencies to 
integrate good design into their programs.

                                                      William J. Clinton
