Statement on Signing the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 
2005
July 24, 2006

    Today I was pleased to sign into law the ``Freedom to Display the 
American Flag Act of 2005.'' Americans have long flown our flag at their 
homes as an expression of their appreciation for our freedoms and their 
pride in our Nation. As our brave men and women continue to fight to 
protect our country overseas, Congress has passed an important measure 
to protect our citizens' right to express their patriotism here at home 
without burdensome restrictions.

Note: H.R. 42, approved July 24, was assigned Public Law No. 109-243.
