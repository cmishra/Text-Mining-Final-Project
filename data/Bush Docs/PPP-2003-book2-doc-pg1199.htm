Statement on the National Do-Not-Call Registry
September 25, 2003

    Unwanted telemarketing calls are intrusive, annoying, and all too 
common. When Americans are sitting down to dinner or parents are reading 
to their children, the last thing they want is a call from a stranger 
with a sales pitch.
    For that reason, I have strongly supported the actions of the 
Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission to 
establish a National Do-Not-Call Registry and protect consumers.
    The millions of people who have signed up for the list have the 
right to reduce unwanted telephone solicitations. I commend Congress for 
its rapid action to support the Registry, and I look forward to signing 
this legislation.
