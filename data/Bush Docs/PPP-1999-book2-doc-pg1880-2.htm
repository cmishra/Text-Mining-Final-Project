Statement on the Election of Fernando de la Rua<de la Rua, 
Fernando> as President of Argentina
October 25, 1999

    On behalf of the people of the United States, I congratulate 
Fernando de la Rua on his victory in Argentina's Presidential election. 
The Argentine elections were a model of civic participation and a 
testament to the strength and vibrancy of Argentina's democracy.
    I look forward to working with President-elect de la Rua and to 
deepening the partnership between our two nations.
