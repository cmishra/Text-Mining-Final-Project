Statement on the Fifth Anniversary of the Proliferation Security 
Initiative
May 28, 2008

    Members of the international community are gathered in Washington, 
DC, today on the fifth anniversary of the Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI). Since former Polish President Kwasniewski<Kwasniewski, 
Aleksander<ls-thn-eq> and I first announced the initiative on May 31, 
2003, in Krakow, Poland, PSI partner nations have been taking 
cooperative action to stop the proliferation trade and to deny 
terrorists, rogue states, and their supplier networks access to weapons 
of mass destruction (WMD), their delivery systems, and related 
materials.
    Five years ago, the world became aware that an international black 
market network, headed by A.Q. Khan,<Khan, Abdul Qadeer<ls-thn-eq> had 
for many years supplied a clandestine nuclear weapons program in Libya. 
Recently, the discovery of Syria's covert nuclear reactor demonstrated 
that proliferators are capable of pursuing dangerous objectives even as 
the world becomes more vigilant. And today, in violation of United 
Nations Security

Council resolutions, Iran continues to enrich uranium and develop 
missile systems that could eventually deliver WMD. These proliferation 
activities undermine peace and security and remind us of the continued 
need for cooperative action.
    The PSI has responded to this challenge and achieved a solid record 
of success. Beginning in 2003 with only 11 states, the PSI has grown to 
more than 90 nations from every region of the world committed to conduct 
interdictions and deter those engaged in this dangerous trade. As a 
result of the collaborative efforts and training it sponsors, PSI is an 
increasingly effective tool to carry out real-world WMD-related 
interdictions, from shutting down front companies to disrupting 
financial networks, prosecuting proliferators, and stopping shipments of 
sensitive materials from reaching their intended destination.
    I commend all PSI partners for the work they have undertaken and 
pledge continued U.S. leadership and support for the effort. I urge all 
responsible nations to join this global initiative to end WMD 
proliferation.
