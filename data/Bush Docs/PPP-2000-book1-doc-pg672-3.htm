Konstandinos<ls-thn-eq> Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic, and his 
PASOK party for their victory in the Greek legislative elections on 
April 9. I also applaud Konstandinos Karamanlis<Karamanlis,

elections demonstrated yet again the vitality of democracy in the land 
of its birth and should serve as an example to the rest of the world.
    The election results and the debates fostered by the campaign show a 
broad consensus in favor of the course Greece has chosen: economic 
prosperity at home and fuller integration with the European Union; 
leadership in building stability in the Balkans and southeastern Europe; 
improved relations with Turkey; and progress toward a just and lasting 
settlement on Cyprus. On these and other issues, the United States 
pledges its continuing support and cooperation.
