Statement on the Death of William V. Roth, Jr.<Roth, William V., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq>
December 14, 2003

    During his extraordinary career as a United States Senator, Bill 
Roth was the taxpayer's friend and the people's champion. He worked to 
cut wasteful Government spending and was one of the first to argue that 
lower taxes would lead to greater economic growth. Among his many other 
legislative achievements, he helped create the retirement account that 
bears his name and that has benefited millions of American families. He 
was an American hero, earning a Bronze Star for his service in World War 
II. Bill Roth was loved and respected by the people of Delaware and by 
his colleagues in the United States Congress. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our condolences to his wife, Jane,<Roth, 
Jane R.<ls-thn-eq> herself a dedicated public servant and superb Federal 
judge; to the Roth family; and to the Roths' many friends in Delaware 
and throughout the country.
