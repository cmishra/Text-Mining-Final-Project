Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting Line Item Vetoes of the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1998
October 14, 1997

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Line Item Veto Act, I hereby cancel the 
dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority, as specified in the 
attached reports, contained in the ``Department of Defense 
Appropriations Act, 1998'' (Public Law 105-56; H.R. 2266). I have 
determined that the cancellation of these amounts will reduce the 
Federal budget deficit, will not impair any essential Government 
functions, and will not harm the national interest. This letter, 
together with its attachments, constitute a special message under 
section 1022 of the Congressional Budget and Compoundment Act of 1974, 
as amended.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. The 
reports detailing the cancellations were published in the Federal 
Register on October 15.
