Statement on the Attack on the Israeli-Argentine Mutual Association in 
Buenos Aires
July 18, 1994

    The United States deeply regrets the loss of life caused by the 
cowardly attack Monday against the Israeli-Argentine Mutual Association 
in Buenos Aires.
    This terrible loss of innocent life must not deter civilized society 
from opposing the enemies of peace.
    The United States will redouble its efforts on behalf of peace in 
the Middle East and elsewhere and offers its full assistance and 
cooperation in helping to identify and locate those responsible for this 
brutal act.
