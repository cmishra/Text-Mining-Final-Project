Statement on the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly's Vote To Confirm 
Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari<Jafari, Ibrahim al- <ls-thn-eq> and His 
Cabinet
April 28, 2005

    Iraq's Transitional National Assembly has voted by an overwhelming 
margin to confirm Ibrahim al-Jafari as Iraq's next Prime Minister. They 
also have approved a list of Cabinet ministers who will represent the 
unity and diversity of Iraq in the months ahead. I join with all 
Americans in congratulating Iraq's new leaders and in wishing them well 
as they begin to serve their country in this new Government. I 
appreciate the dedicated work of the outgoing Interim Government, which 
has governed Iraq for the last 10 months.
    The Iraqi Transitional Government will confront important challenges 
in fighting terrorists and enemies of democracy, training the Iraqi 
security forces, and providing basic services to its citizens. It will 
also lead the difficult and essential work of drafting a new 
constitution for a free and democratic Iraq. The United States is 
confident that the new Government will meet these challenges in the 
months ahead, and America will stand by Iraq, its leaders, and the Iraqi 
people as they continue their work to establish a stable, peaceful, and 
democratic Iraq.
