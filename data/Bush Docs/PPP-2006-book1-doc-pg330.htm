Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report Relating to the 
Interdiction of Aircraft Engaged in Illicit Drug Trafficking
February 22, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with the authorities relating to official immunity in the 
interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking (Public Law 
107-108, 22 U.S.C. 2291-4), and in order to keep the Congress fully 
informed, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration. This 
report addresses the matter of assistance for interdiction of aircraft 
engaged in illicit drug trafficking.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
