Statement on the Court Decision on the Communications Decency Act
June 12, 1996

    The Justice Department is reviewing today's three-judge panel court 
decision on the Communications Decency Act. The opinion just came down

Constitution allows us to help parents by enforcing this act to prevent 
children from being exposed to objectionable material transmitted 
through computer networks. I will continue to do everything I can in my 
administration to give families every available tool to protect their 
children from these materials. For example, we vigorously support the

and widespread availability of products that allow both parents and 
schools to block objectionable materials from reaching computers that 
children use. And we also support the industry's accelerating efforts to 
rate Internet sites so that they are compatible with these blocking 
techniques.
