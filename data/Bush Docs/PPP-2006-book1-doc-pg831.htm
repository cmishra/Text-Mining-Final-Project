Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Attached is a classified report on my decision to take no action to

President by section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the 
``Exon-Florio amendment''), 50 U.S.C. App. 2170, and on the basis of the 
recommendation from senior officials who make up the Committee on 
Foreign Investment in the United States.
    The attached report, prepared by my Administration, is submitted 
consistent with subsection (g) of that amendment and is subject to the 
provisions of subsection (c) regarding confidentiality of information.
