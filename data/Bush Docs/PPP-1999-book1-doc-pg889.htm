Statement on South Africa's National Elections
June 4, 1999

    It is my great pleasure to congratulate President Nelson 
Mandela<Mandela, Nelson> and the people of South Africa for 
Wednesday's successful national elections.
    It has been my honor and privilege to work with my great and 
courageous friend President Mandela<Mandela, Nelson> during 
the past 5 years as he and his fellow citizens have worked to heal the 
wounds of the past and build a new, inclusive, democratic, and free 
South Africa. The elections Wednesday represent an important step on 
that continuing journey. Their peaceful and fair conduct and the 
tremendous voter turnout are a testament to South Africa's extraordinary 
transformation. I congratulate all the parties and candidates who 
participated.

    And on behalf of all Americans, I congratulate the people of South 
Africa for their determination and hard work to build a better future. 
By doing so, South Africa has reminded us of the preciousness of 
democracy and the resilience of the human spirit. South Africa's example 
shows the way forward for other troubled areas of the world, from Kosovo 
to the Middle East to Kashmir--inclusive, democratic government that 
represents the will of the people can be a bulwark against conflict and 
a foundation for reconciliation, cooperation, and lasting peace.

We will continue to work in partnership with South Africa to build a 
world of justice and tolerance, opportunity and prosperity, democracy 
and security.
