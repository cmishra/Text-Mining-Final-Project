Statement on Senate Confirmation of John D. Negroponte<Negroponte, John 
D.<ls-thn-eq> as Director of National Intelligence
April 21, 2005

    I commend the Senate for moving quickly to confirm John Negroponte 
as the first Director of National Intelligence. I congratulate John on 
his confirmation, and I look forward to working closely with him. As the 
DNI, Ambassador Negroponte will lead a unified intelligence community as 
it reforms and adapts to the new challenges of the 21st century. The 
United States continues to make progress in the global war on terror 
against the enemies of freedom who target innocent civilians and seek 
weapons of mass destruction. I appreciate John's willingness to once 
again serve his country and the many men and women who serve in the 
intelligence community.
