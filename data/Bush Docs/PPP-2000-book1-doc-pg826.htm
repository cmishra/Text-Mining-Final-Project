Statement on the Death of John Cardinal O'Connor<O'Connor, John 
Cardinal<ls-thn-eq>
May 3, 2000

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Cardinal 
O'Connor. For more than 50 years, he reached out with uncommon fortitude 
to minister the needs of American Catholics. From his first Philadelphia 
parish to soldiers on the battlefield, from the carnage of Bosnia to the 
tragedy of AIDS, he also sought out and served those most in need. His 
lifelong journey of faith was our Nation's blessing. From his 
distinguished career as a Navy chaplain, to his determination to give 
voice to the poor and marginalized in New York and across America, the 
courage and firm faith he showed in his final illness inspired us all.
    Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and all who loved him.
