Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Legislative Agenda
December 19, 2005

    I appreciate the House of Representatives for its work to meet key 
national priorities, including funding the war on terror, voting to 
renew provisions of the PATRIOT Act, assisting hurricane victims, 
reducing our dependence on foreign sources of oil, and preparing against 
the threat of an avian flu pandemic. I also applaud the House for being 
wise with taxpayer dollars and approving a significant reduction in 
spending on entitlements. I thank the Speaker<Hastert, J. 
Dennis<ls-thn-eq> and the House leaders, Chairman Nussle,<Nussle, James 
A.<ls-thn-eq> and the chairmen of the authorizing committees for their 
leadership. I urge the Senate to send these bills to my desk promptly so 
that I can sign them into law.
