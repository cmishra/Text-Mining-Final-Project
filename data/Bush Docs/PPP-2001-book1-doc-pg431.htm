Statement on the Observance of Earth Day
April 21, 2001

    On April 22 each year for more than three decades, Americans have 
paused on Earth Day to celebrate the rich blessings of our Nation's 
natural resources and to take stock of our stewardship of nature's 
gifts. Each of us understands that our prosperity as a nation will mean 
little if our legacy to future generations is a world of polluted air, 
toxic waste, and vanished forests.
    During the past 31 years, we have made progress on protecting our 
environment. America is truly blessed with a vibrant and flourishing 
environment. But with blessings come responsibility. There is much more 
to do. As we celebrate Earth Day on this April 22, 2001, I encourage 
Americans to join me in renewing our commitment to protecting the 
environment and leaving our children and grandchildren with a legacy of 
clean water, clean air, and natural beauty.
