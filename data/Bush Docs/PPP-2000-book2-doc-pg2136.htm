Statement on Suspending the Immigration of Persons Impeding the Peace 
Process in Sierra Leone
October 11, 2000

    I have signed a proclamation suspending the entry into the United 
States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of all persons--and the 
spouses, children, and parents of all persons--who plan, engage in, or 
benefit from activities that support the Revolutionary United Front 
(RUF) or that otherwise impede the peace process in Sierra Leone. These 
visa restrictions will immediately apply to President Charles 
Taylor,<Taylor, Charles> senior members of the Government of 
Liberia, their closest supporters, and their family members.
    I call upon the Liberian Government to end immediately Liberia's 
trafficking in weapons and illicit diamonds, which fuels the war in 
Sierra Leone, and instead to use its influence with the RUF to restore 
peace and stability to Sierra Leone. Members of my administration have 
repeatedly made this request of President Taylor.<Taylor, 
Charles> The absence of any positive response from his

government leaves us little choice but to impose these restrictions. 
Only when the Government of Liberia ends its participation in activities 
that support the RUF will the United States review this policy.

Note: The proclamation of October 10 is listed in Appendix D at the end 
of this volume.
