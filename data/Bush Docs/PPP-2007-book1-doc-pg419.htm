Remarks on the Shootings at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia
April 16, 2007

    Our Nation is shocked and saddened by the news of the shootings at 
Virginia Tech today. The exact total has not yet been confirmed, but it 
appears that more than 30 people were killed and many more were wounded.
    I've spoken with Governor Tim Kaine<Kaine, Timothy M.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Virginia Tech President Charles Steger.<Steger, Charles W.<ls-thn-eq> I 
told them that Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I and many across our 
Nation are praying for the victims and their families and all the 
members of the university community who have been devastated by this 
terrible tragedy. I told them that my administration would do everything 
possible to assist with the investigation, and that I pledged that we 
would stand ready to help local law enforcement and the local community 
in any way we can during this time of sorrow.
    Schools should be places of safety and sanctuary and learning. When 
that sanctuary is violated, the impact is felt in every American 
classroom and every American community.
    Today our Nation grieves with those who have lost loved ones at 
Virginia Tech. We hold the victims in our hearts; we lift them up in our 
prayers; and we ask a loving God to comfort those who are suffering 
today.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 4:01 p.m. in the Diplomatic Reception Room 
at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Charles W. Steger, 
president, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The 
Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
transcript of these remarks. The related proclamation of April 17 is 
listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
