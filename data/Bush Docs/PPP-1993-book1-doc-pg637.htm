Exchange With Reporters Following the Small Business Person Award 
Ceremony
May 12, 1993

Bosnia

    Q. Mr. President, have you changed your views on the arms embargo at 
all?
    The President. No.
    Q. Does the fighting----
    The President. I haven't changed my views. I just don't know if I've 
changed anybody else's, but I haven't changed my views.

Associate Attorney General Nominee

    Q. Do you still back Webb Hubbell's nomination?
    The President. Of course. Why wouldn't I?
    Q. What about the Republican calls for him to resign?
    The President. A little inconsistency in their position. Look how

    Q. Such as who?

Deficit Reduction

    Q. Mr. President, why do you feel you have to make this guarantee on 
deficit reduction?
    The President. I just think it will help to reinforce the commitment 
that we already have: no taxes without spending cuts; all the taxes go 
to the deficit. I think that's what we ought to do. That's the way we 
set it up. Now we'll just put it into the law. It will be even better.
    Q. What effects do you think it will have on Congress?
    The President. It's consistent with what I did as the Governor at 
home, too. When I raised money at home for education, we put it into 
education, and it can only be spent on that.
    Q. Is it a compromise?
    The President. Gosh, no. It makes it better. I mean, I don't know 
who--compromise--I don't know if anybody's against it. But I think it's 
the right thing to do.

Note: The exchange began at 11:40 a.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this 
exchange.
