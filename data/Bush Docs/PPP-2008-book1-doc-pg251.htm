Remarks at a Lunch Hosted by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf<Johnson 
Sirleaf, Ellen<ls-thn-eq> of Liberia in Monrovia
February 21, 2008

    Madam President, I want to make sure I've got the following 
correctly: Here they call you the ``Iron Lady,'' and here they call you 
``Ma.'' And I call you friend.
    We are honored to be here. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are 
thrilled to be here with our delegation to end what has been a very 
productive trip to the continent of Africa. I can't think of a better 
place to finish than in--with our dear friend, Liberia.
    It is easy to destroy a country; it is hard to rebuild a country. 
And I--Madam President, I want you to know that the United States of 
America supports you as you rebuild your country. We share a special 
history with Liberia. It's a history that is deep, and I want the people 
of your beautiful country to know that our help is just beginning.
    And so, Madam President, I propose a toast to you and the strength 
of your leadership and the quality of your character. And to the good 
people of Liberia, may God bless.

Note: The President spoke at 12:54 p.m. in the Executive Mansion. The 
transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included 
the remarks of President Johnson Sirleaf.
