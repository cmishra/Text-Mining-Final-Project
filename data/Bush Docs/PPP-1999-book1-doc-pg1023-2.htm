Statement on Accepting the Invitation To Serve as Honorary Chairman of 
the Presidents Cup
June 25, 1999

    I am pleased to accept the invitation to serve as honorary chairman 
of the Presidents Cup, one of the premier international events in golf. 
I thank Commissioner Tim Finchem<Finchem, Tim> and the PGA 
Tour as well as the participating international golf tours for this 
invitation. It is an honor to succeed Presidents George Bush<Bush, 
George> and Gerald Ford,<Ford, Gerald R.> as well as 
Australian Prime Minister John Howard,<Howard, John> as 
honorary chairman of this event.
    I know that, more and more, people around the world share America's 
enthusiasm for golf. The Presidents Cup helps bring our countries 
together in spirited and good-natured competition. In 1996 I was glad to 
attend the Presidents Cup at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club, and I am 
looking forward to another display of skill and sportsmanship by the 
United States and international teams in October 2000.
