Statement on Signing the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization 
Act of 2005
January 10, 2006

    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 972, the ``Trafficking Victims 
Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005.'' This Act enhances our ability 
to combat trafficking in persons by extending and improving 
prosecutorial and diplomatic tools, and also adds new protections for 
victims.
    Section 104(e)(2) purports to require the Secretary of State, prior 
to voting for a new or reauthorized peacekeeping mission under the 
auspices of a multilateral organization (or, in an emergency, as far in 
advance as is practicable), to submit to the Congress a specific report. 
The executive branch shall construe this reporting requirement in a 
manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority as 
Commander in Chief and the President's constitutional authority to 
conduct the Nation's foreign affairs.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 January 10, 2006.

Note: H.R. 972, approved January 10, was assigned Public Law No. 109-
164.
