Message to the Senate Transmitting the South Korea-United States
Legal Assistance Treaty
January 12, 1995

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of 
the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Korea 
on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Washington on 
November 23, 1993, with a related exchange of notes signed the same 
date. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report 
of the Department of State with respect to this Treaty.
    The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance 
treaties that the United States is negotiating in order to counter 
criminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective 
tool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of modern criminals, 
including members of drug cartels, ``white-collar'' criminals, and 
terrorists. The Treaty is self-executing.
    The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal 
matters. Mutual assistance available under the treaty includes: (1) 
taking testimony or statements of persons; (2) providing documents, 
records, and articles of evidence; (3) serving documents; (4) locating 
or identifying persons or items; (5) transferring persons in custody for 
testimony or other purposes; (6) executing requests for searches and 
seizures; (7) assisting in forfeiture proceedings; and (8) rendering any 
other form of assistance not prohibited by the laws of the Requested 
State.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

January 12, 1995.
