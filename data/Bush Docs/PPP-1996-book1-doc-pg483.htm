Statement on Signing Tax Benefit Legislation for Military Personnel 
Serving in Operation Joint Endeavor
March 20, 1996

    Today, in recognition of the sacrifices members of the U.S. Armed 
Forces are making in and around Bosnia, I signed a bill extending 
special tax benefits to military personnel serving in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia.
    During Vietnam and the Gulf war, tax relief was granted to 
individuals serving in ``combat zones.'' By extending similar tax 
benefits to those supporting peace efforts in the former Yugoslavia, 
this legislation recognizes the unique hardships and risks members of 
the U.S. Armed Forces face in non-combat missions like the one in 
Bosnia.
    I wish to thank Congress for their overwhelming support and timely 
passage of this legislation and also for their recognition of the 
hardships encountered by American troops serving in Operation Joint 
Endeavor.

Note: H.R. 2778, approved March 20, was assigned Public Law No. 104-117.
