Statement on the Death of Charles M. Schulz, Jr.<Schulz, Charles M., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq>
February 13, 2000

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Charles 
M. Schulz, Jr. On the day that our newspapers print his very last 
``Peanuts'' strip, it is especially poignant that we mourn the passing 
of Charles Schulz himself. For 50 years, his keen eye, his good and 
generous heart, and his active brush and pen have given life to the most 
memorable cast of characters ever to enliven our daily papers. The 
hopeful and hapless Charlie Brown, the joyful Snoopy, the soulful 
Linus--even the ``crabby'' Lucy--give voice, day after day, to what 
makes us human.
    Today, in his final strip, Charles Schulz writes, ``Charlie Brown, 
Snoopy, Linus, Lucy . . . how can I ever forget them. . . .'' We can say 
with certainty that we will never forget them, or their creator, or the 
many gifts he has given us all.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Jeannie,<Schulz, 
Jeannie<ls-thn-eq> and their children.
