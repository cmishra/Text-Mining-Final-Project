Statement on Lifting the Ban on Direct Flights Between the United States 
and Nigeria
December 22, 1999

    Earlier today, Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater<Slater, 
Rodney E.> announced that the United States is lifting our ban 
on direct flights to Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos, Nigeria.
    I congratulate President Obasanjo<Obasanjo, Olusegun> and 
his government for taking the steps necessary to remove this ban, 
including the overhauling of Nigeria's airport security system. These 
important reforms provided one more indication of the Nigerian 
administration's commitment to good governance. They offer new evidence 
that Nigeria is reversing the damage that years of corruption and 
mismanagement inflicted upon its international reputation.
    I am deeply gratified to see a government chosen by the Nigerian 
people earning the trust and respect of the world. I look forward to 
strengthening our partnership with Nigeria even further over the coming 
year.

Note: The statement referred to President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria.
