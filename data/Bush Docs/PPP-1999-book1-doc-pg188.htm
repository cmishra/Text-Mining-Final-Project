Message on the Observance of the Lunar New Year, 1999
February 11, 1999

    Warm greetings to everyone observing the Lunar New Year.
    This annual festival, rooted in the ancient religious and cultural 
traditions of Asia, is a joyous celebration of family and community, of 
hope and new beginnings. Each year during the first month of the lunar 
calendar, millions of families across America and around the world 
gather to welcome the imminent arrival of spring by honoring their 
ancestors, visiting friends, sharing delicious food, and enjoying a 
profusion of fireworks, colorful decorations, parades, music, and 
dancing.
    The celebration of the Lunar New Year is also a reminder of how much 
our national life has been enriched by the customs, culture, and 
achievements of Asian Americans. In every field of endeavor, from 
business to the arts, from government to academia, Asian Americans are 
making vital contributions to our country's progress and prosperity.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes to all for a wonderful 
celebration and for a new year of health, happiness, and peace.

                                                            Bill Clinton
