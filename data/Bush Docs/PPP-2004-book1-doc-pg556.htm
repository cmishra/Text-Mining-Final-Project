Statement on Signing Legislation To Provide for the Conveyance to the 
Utrok Atoll Local Government of a Decommissioned National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration Ship
April 13, 2004

    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 2584, a bill to provide for the 
conveyance to the Utrok Atoll local government of a decommissioned 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship, and for other 
purposes.
    Section 101(c) of the bill purports to require the Utrok Atoll local 
government, in consultation with the Government of the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands, to submit a plan to four committees of the United 
States Congress for the use of the ship to be conveyed. The Republic of 
the Marshall Islands, of which Utrok is a political subdivision, is a 
self-governing republic with a sovereign right to self-determination 
whose government has the capacity to conduct foreign affairs. 
Accordingly, in light of the status of the Republic of the Marshall 
Islands and the exclusive authority of the President with respect to the 
conduct of the foreign affairs of the United States, the executive 
branch shall construe section 101(c) as asking the President to request, 
rather than as requiring, that the Utrok political subdivision submit a 
plan for use of the ship to be conveyed. The Secretary of State, after 
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall communicate on my 
behalf as appropriate with the Government of the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands to

effectuate to the extent permissible the purposes of section 101.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 April 13, 2004.

Note: H.R. 2584, approved April 13, was assigned Public Law No. 108-219.
