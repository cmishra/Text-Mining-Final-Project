Remarks at a Cinco de Mayo Celebration
May 4, 2001

    Thank you all. We welcome you to this Cinco de Mayo celebration, 
even though it's on the quatro de Mayo. [Laughter] But it's such an 
important holiday, we decided to start early.
    I really appreciate el Embajador de Mexico, Juan Jose 
Bremer.<Bremer, Juan Jose<ls-thn-eq> Thank you for your kind words, 
thank you for your leadership, and welcome.
    I appreciate so very much Thalia<Thalia<ls-thn-eq> for being here. I 
am thankful that she did not ask me to dance. [Laughter] But I loved her 
voice and loved her music. Pablo<Montero, Pablo<ls-thn-eq> Montero--
thank you very much, Pablo, for

coming. We will treasure that beautiful gift you gave to Laura,<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> via me. [Laughter]
    It is a pleasure to see my friend Don Francisco.<Kreutzberger, Mario 
``Don Francisco''<ls-thn-eq> I had the honor of interviewing with Don 
Francisco before. He's a good man. And finally, por fin, mi amigo 
Emilio<Estefan, Emilio<ls-thn-eq> Estefan--Emilio, thank you very much 
for coming. He's lucky we didn't let him in without Gloria.<Estefan, 
Gloria<ls-thn-eq> [Laughter] I know you join me in thanking the 
fantastic dancers and the mariachis. It's such beautiful music, and the 
White House is blessed by your presence.
    Some in my administration are here that I must introduce. Hector 
Barreto,<Barreto, Hector V., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> he's going to make fine 
leader of the Small Business Administration; Eduardo Aguirre,<Aguirre, 
Eduardo<ls-thn-eq> who is going to be a senior official at the Export-
Import Bank--Eduardo. Rosario Marin<Marin, Rosario<ls-thn-eq> is here; 
she is going to be the Treasurer of the United States. We could go on 
all day long, but there's one other fellow I want to introduce. He's a 
friend of Mexico. He's a great United States Senator, the Senator from 
the State of New Mexico, Pete Domenici.<Domenici, Pete<ls-thn-eq> Is Ed 
Pastor<Pastor, Ed<ls-thn-eq> here? I don't see Ed.
    Today we remember a proud moment for the people of Mexico, when 
Mexican soldiers won the Battle of Puebla. When the news of that victory 
reached this house, it was recognized and recorded by Abraham Lincoln. 
Then, and for many years afterwards, the United States and Mexico lived 
two very different histories, often divided by misperceptions and 
mistrust. It's changed. The United States and Mexico now share ties of 
history, familia, values, commerce, and culture. We are more united in 
friendship and common purpose than ever before.
    Just yesterday I had yet another visit with my friend el Presidente 
Vicente Fox.<Fox, Vicente<ls-thn-eq> This is the third time my friend 
and I have had a chance to dialog about the incredibly important 
relationship between the United States and Mexico. And I hope people 
take note that in a few months he'll come back as the honored guest of 
the first state dinner I will have as President of the United States. We 
have worked together as Governors; we will work together as Presidents. 
And we'll always work in the spirit of mutual respect.
    Cinco de Mayo is a day for special pride and remembrance for people 
on--it's a reminder of the pride--of the proud heritage of many 
Americans and the warm and growing friendship between two great nations. 
It's a day worth celebrating.
    I want to thank you all for coming. Laura and I welcome you--so 
pleased so many folks came. Again, I want to thank the fantastic artists 
who are here. Mi Casa Blanca es su Casa Blanca. Adios.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 3:23 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Mexican Ambassador to the United 
States Juan Jose Bremer; entertainers Thalia, Pablo Montero, and Emilio 
and Gloria Estefan; Spanish-language television host Mario Kreutzberger, 
popularly known as ``Don Francisco''; and President Vicente Fox of 
Mexico.
