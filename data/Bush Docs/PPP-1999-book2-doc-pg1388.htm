Statement on the Intention To Veto the Proposed Republican Tax Cut
August 5, 1999

    Whether the Republican tax plan is sent to me today, tomorrow, next 
week, or next month, I will have no choice but to veto it immediately. 
It threatens Social Security and Medicare, makes it harder to pay off 
the debt, and imperils the prosperity that has brought real benefits to 
American families.
