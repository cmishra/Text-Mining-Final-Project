Statement on 1997 Appropriations for the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service
January 14, 1997

    For many years, the Immigration and Naturalization Service did not 
receive sufficient resources to carry out some of its vital functions. 
As a result, control of our borders suffered and illegal immigration 
flourished.
    Four years ago, we began an effort to revitalize the INS by 
providing the resources and commitment to fulfill our responsibilities. 
During this period, INS funding has grown 105 percent. Our borders have 
been greatly strengthened with more personnel and better technology, 
workplace enforcement has gotten tougher, and a record number of 
criminal aliens have been deported.
    Today's announcement represents continuing wise management of the 
additional resources requested by me and provided by the Congress. And 
it represents my administration's continuing commitment to an 
immigration policy that recognizes the value of legal immigration while 
strengthening our efforts to restrict illegal immigration.
