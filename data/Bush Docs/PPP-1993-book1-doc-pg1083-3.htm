Nomination for Posts at the Department of Labor and the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service
July 14, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate Martin 
Manley to be the Assistant Secretary of Labor for the Office of the New 
American Workplace and John Calhoun Wells to be Director of the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service.
    ``Martin Manley and John Calhoun Wells have both spent much of their 
lives trying to bring labor and management together in partnerships for 
growth,'' said the President. ``That is exactly the kind of person that 
we need in these important positions. I am confident that they will 
bring that same spirit of cooperation to their work in my 
administration.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
