Statement on Signing the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation 
Protection Act
June 19, 1998

    I was very pleased to sign today S. 1244, the Religious Liberty and 
Charitable Donation Protection Act. This bill protects the religious and 
charitable contributions made by people who later declare bankruptcy.

    As Americans, we value the important role religious and charitable 
institutions play in the daily life of this Nation. Indeed, we know that 
fiscal responsibility for these institutions is fundamental to their 
efforts to meet the spiritual, social and other concerns of our Nation. 
It is a great loss to all of our citizens for creditors to recoup their 
losses in bankruptcy cases from donations made in good faith by our 
citizens to their churches and charitable institutions.
    As Americans we also know that giving, whether to one's church, 
temple, mosque, or other house of worship or to any charitable 
organization, fosters and enriches our sense of community. We need to 
encourage, not discourage, that sense of community. The Religious 
Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act does just that.

Note: S. 1244, approved June 19, was assigned Public Law No. 105-183.
