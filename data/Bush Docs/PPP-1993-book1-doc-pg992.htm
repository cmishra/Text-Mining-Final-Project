July 2, 1993

    The President announced his intention today to nominate Sheila E. 
Widnall, associate provost of MIT and vice chair of the Carnegie 
Corporation Board, to be the Secretary of the Air Force. Ms. Widnall 
will be the first woman Service Secretary.
    ``I am very proud to be making this announcement,'' said the 
President. ``Sheila Widnall is a woman of high achievement: a respected 
scientist, a skilled administrator, and a dedicated citizen. I am 
confident that she will do an outstanding job of guiding the Air Force 
through this period of post-cold-war change.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
