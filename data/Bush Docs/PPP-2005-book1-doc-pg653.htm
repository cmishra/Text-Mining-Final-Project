Statement on Senate Passage of Appropriations Legislation for 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and the War on Terror
April 21, 2005

    I applaud the Senate for its strong bipartisan support for our 
troops and our continued effort to win the war on terror. New 
democracies are taking root in Iraq and Afghanistan, and America is 
proud to stand with them. Both countries are assuming greater 
responsibility for their own security, which will help our troops return 
home as quickly as possible with the honor they have earned. I urge the 
House and Senate to reach a final agreement that focuses taxpayer 
dollars on providing the tools our troops and diplomats need now, so 
that I can sign a bill into law as soon as possible.
