Exchange With Reporters on the Expulsion of Russian Diplomats
March 22, 2001

    Q. Relations with the Russians in trouble, headed for trouble?
    The President. No, the actions we took yesterday speak for 
themselves. I'm confident that we can have good relations with the 
Russians. There are some areas where we can work together. But we made 
the right decision yesterday.
    Q. Will Moscow expel some United States diplomats?
    The President. I have no idea with Moscow is going to do.
    Q. Should they--is that appropriate? When will you meet with any of 
Russian----
    The President. All I can tell you is that the actions we took 
yesterday speak for themselves. It's the right decision to make, and 
having said that, I believe we can have a working relationship with the 
Russians. I intend to have a working relationship with the Russians. I 
suspect the first time I'll have a chance to sit down with Mr. 
Putin<Putin, Vladimir<ls-thn-eq> is when I head overseas to the G-7-
plus-1, but our Government made the right decision yesterday.
    Q. Mr. President, what about concerns that this takes us back to a 
cold war mentality or strategy?
    The President. We made the right decision yesterday. I was presented 
with the facts; I made the decision; it was the right thing to do. And 
having said that, I believe that we'll have a good working relationship 
with the Russians. But we did the right thing yesterday.

Note: The exchange began at 11:15 a.m. at the Hyatt Regency Washington 
on Capitol Hill. In his remarks, the President referred to President 
Vladimir Putin of Russia. A tape was not available for verification of
