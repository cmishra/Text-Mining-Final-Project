Statement on the Church of God in Christ's Endorsement of the Faith-
Based and Community Initiative
July 5, 2001

    I am pleased to receive the Church of God in Christ's strong 
endorsement of my Faith-Based and Community Initiative. The Church of 
God in Christ's support is even greater evidence that people dedicated 
to serving their communities and neighbors are fully supportive of my 
plan. This influential organization joins groups including the Roman 
Catholic Bishops, Salvation Army, Prison Fellowship, and AMEN, our 
Nation's largest Latino community-serving ministries network, in 
supporting this important initiative.

Note: The statement released by the Office of the Press Secretary noted 
that the Church of God in Christ was the Nation's second largest 
historically black congregation, with 5 million members and 16,000 
churches nationwide. The Office of the Press Secretary also made 
available the letter of endorsement from Presiding Bishop G.E. 
Patterson, Church of God in Christ.
