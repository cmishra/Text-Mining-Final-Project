Remarks Following a Meeting With the Interagency Team on Iraq at Camp 
David, Maryland
June 12, 2006

    I want to thank Generals Abizaid<Abizaid, John P.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Casey,<Casey, George W., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> as well as Ambassador 
Khalilzad<Khalilzad, Zalmay<ls-thn-eq> for the last--for the briefing 
for the last 3 hours. I thought your assessment of the situation in Iraq 
was very realistic. I think your recommendations to us on how to win in 
Iraq, to have an Iraq that can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend 
itself are--your recommendations are valid.
    I look forward to continuing to visit with you later on this 
afternoon about how we can help this new Government succeed. 
Zal,<Khalilzad, Zalmay<ls-thn-eq> you've been--I just want to thank you 
all very much for remaining in theater and working as hard as you are. 
You're making a significant difference.
    And again, please give my best congratulations to the troops on the

the war. On the other hand, it was a major blow to Al Qaida and the 
killers and terrorists that are trying to spread violence and suffering 
and stop the emergence of a new democracy.
    Zal,<Khalilzad, Zalmay<ls-thn-eq> we left off where you were talking 
about the way forward in Iraq and your perception of this new 
Government.

Note: The President spoke at 12:33 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Gen. John P. Abizaid, USA, commander, U.S. Central Command; Gen. George 
W. Casey, Jr., USA, commanding general, Multi-National Force--Iraq; U.S. 
Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad; and senior Al Qaida associate Abu 
Musab Al Zarqawi, who was killed in Baquba, Iraq, on June 7. A portion 
of these remarks could not be verified because the tape was incomplete.
