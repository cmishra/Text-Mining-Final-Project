Statement on the Parliamentary Elections in Iran
February 24, 2004

    I am very disappointed in the recently disputed parliamentary 
elections in Iran. The disqualification of some 2,400 candidates by the 
unelected Guardian Council deprived many Iranians of the opportunity to 
freely choose their representatives. I join many in Iran and around the 
world in condemning the Iranian regime's efforts to stifle freedom of 
speech--including the closing of two leading reformist newspapers--in 
the runup to the election. Such measures undermine the rule of law and 
are clear attempts to deny the Iranian people's desire to freely choose 
their leaders.
    The United States supports the Iranian people's aspirations to live 
in freedom, enjoy their God-given rights, and determine their own 
destiny.
