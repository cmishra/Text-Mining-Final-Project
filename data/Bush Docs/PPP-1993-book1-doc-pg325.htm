Exchange With Reporters in Atlanta
March 19, 1993

Potential Supreme Court Nominee

    Q. Mr. President, excuse the interruption, sir, but could you give 
us some feel for what you'll be looking for in a replacement for Justice 
White?
    The President. I already said that in Washington. I used to teach 
constitutional law, and I think that there are few decisions the 
President makes which are more weighty, more significant, or can have a 
greater impact on more Americans than an appointment to the Supreme 
Court. And I'm going to try to pick a person that has a fine mind, good 
judgment, wide experience in the law and in the problems of real people, 
and someone with a big heart.

Note: The exchange began at 1:10 p.m. at the Downtown Child Development 
Center.
