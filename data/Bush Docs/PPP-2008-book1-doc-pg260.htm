Remarks at a Dinner for the National Governors Association Conference
February 24, 2008

    Good evening. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are honored to have 
you here, and it's a pleasure to be here with a lot of friends. You 
know, I've developed a unique perspective on this event. For 6 years, I 
sat and watched the President speak; for 8 years, I was the President 
and spoke. [Laughter] And next year, I'll be watching on C-SPAN. 
[Laughter]
    I appreciate Tim Pawlenty<Pawlenty, Timothy J.<ls-thn-eq> and Ed 
Rendell,<Rendell, Edward G.<ls-thn-eq> for--serve as the chair and vice 
chair of the National Governors Association. I congratulate our two 
newest Governors, Kentucky's Steve Beshear<Beshear, Steven L.<ls-thn-eq> 
and Louisiana's Bobby Jindal.<Jindal, Piyush ``Bobby''<ls-thn-eq> I 
might add, Jindal is not here, but he's ably represented by the first 
lady of Louisiana,<Jindal, Supriya<ls-thn-eq> Supriya. And I 
congratulate Governor Haley Barbour<Barbour, Haley R.<ls-thn-eq> of 
Mississippi for his reelection. I want to thank the Vice 
President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> and Lynne Cheney<Cheney, Lynne 
A.V.<ls-thn-eq> for joining us. I also tell you how thankful I am and 
honored we are that Vince Gill<Gill, Vince<ls-thn-eq> and Amy 
Grant<Grant, Amy<ls-thn-eq> have come tonight to entertain us.
    I value our Governors because our Governors are some of the Nation's

policy entrepreneurs. I appreciate what you do. I appreciate the 
sacrifice your families have made to serve America.
    It was in that spirit that Teddy Roosevelt hosted the first 
Governors meeting here at the White House 100 years ago. I can't imagine 
what they were thinking about what America would look like 100 years 
ago, and I'm not sure what people will think 100 years from now. But I 
do know it makes sense to put wise policy in place in the meantime so 
America can remain prosperous and strong and free.
    And so tonight it's my honor to welcome you all and to offer a toast 
to the Nation's Governors.

Note: The President spoke at 7:30 p.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to Gov. Timothy J. Pawlenty of 
Minnesota; Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania; and entertainers 
Vince Gill and Amy Grant.
