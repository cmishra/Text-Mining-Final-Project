Statement on Senate Confirmation of Bill Richardson To Be Secretary of 
Energy
July 31, 1998

    I am very pleased that the Senate today voted unanimously to confirm 
Ambassador Bill Richardson as Secretary of Energy.
    Ambassador Richardson brings extraordinary experience and expertise 
to this vital post. As a Member of the U.S. Congress representing New 
Mexico, an energy-rich State that is home to two Department of Energy 
national laboratories, he has extensive firsthand experience on issues 
ranging from oil and gas deregulation to alternative energy to ensuring 
strong environmental standards in energy development. As U.S. Ambassador 
to the United Nations, he has been a vigorous and articulate proponent 
of U.S. engagement and has successfully tackled tough negotiating 
challenges around the world.
    I am confident that Ambassador Richardson's tremendous energy, 
creativity, and leadership will help secure our Nation's energy future 
so that America continues to prosper.
