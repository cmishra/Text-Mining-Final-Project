Remarks With Gubernatorial Candidate Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr., <Daniels, 
Mitchell, Jr.<ls-thn-eq>in South Bend, Indiana
May 3, 2004

    I am proud to be standing by the side of my friend Mitch 
Daniels.<Daniels, Mitchell, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Mitch is going to be the 
Governor of the State of Indiana, and I know for certain the people of 
this State will love this guy as their Governor. See, I've seen him 
firsthand. I know what it's like to work with Mitch. He's smart. He's 
capable. He's well organized. He's got a fabulous sense of humor.
    I gave him a lot of tough jobs, and he did each of them with great 
professionalism and class. I know the people are going to the polls 
tomorrow in the primary. I'm not a voter in this State, Mitch, but if I 
were, I'd be voting for you, because I'll know you'll be a great 
Governor.
    Do you want to say something?

Note: The President spoke at 11:58 a.m. on his arrival at South Bend 
Regional Airport. The transcript released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary also included the remarks of Mr. Daniels. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of these remarks.
