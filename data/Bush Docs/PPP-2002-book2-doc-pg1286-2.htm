Statement on Northern Ireland
July 24, 2002

    I strongly support Prime Minister Tony Blair's<Blair, 
Tony<ls-thn-eq> statement in the House of Commons today. The United 
States joins with his Government and the Government of Ireland in 
holding paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland accountable when there 
is clear, convincing evidence of their use of violence or preparations 
for it.
    The United States strongly backs the Good Friday agreement as the 
blueprint for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. Since its 
signing 4 years ago, the agreement has brought significant gains to the 
people of Northern Ireland, and it is a beacon of hope for people 
everywhere seeking to overcome histories of violence, terror, and 
sectarian strife. It is the responsibility of all parties, including 
those associated with paramilitaries and those who are not, to work 
together to uphold the agreement and its institutions.
    I condemn the recent violence that has marred the lives of the 
people of Northern Ireland, and I commend those political and civic 
leaders who have worked to stop it. Paramilitaries must end their 
violent activities, cease all preparations for them, and recognize the 
political process as the only valid vehicle for change. Those who cling 
to the violent ways of the past cannot be allowed to derail Northern 
Ireland's progress towards a more peaceful future.
