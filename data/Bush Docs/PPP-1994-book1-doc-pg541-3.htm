Statement on Denying Executive Clemency to Jonathan Pollard
March 23, 1994

    After personally reviewing the Jonathan Pollard matter, I have 
decided to deny his application for executive clemency. I make this 
decision taking into account the recommendation of the Attorney General 
and the unanimous views of the law enforcement and national security 
agencies. My decision is based upon the grave nature of his offense and 
the considerable damage that his actions caused our Nation.
    Mr. Pollard's crime is one of the most serious crimes against our 
country, placing national security secrets of the United States in the 
hands of another country. I have considered Mr. Pollard's argument that 
he is deserving of a shorter prison sentence because he spied for a 
friendly nation. I nevertheless believe that the enormity of Mr. 
Pollard's crime, the harm his actions caused to our country, and the 
need to deter every person who might even consider such actions, warrant 
his continued incarceration.
