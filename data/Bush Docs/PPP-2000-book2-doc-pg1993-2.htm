Statement on Signing the First Continuing Resolution for Fiscal Year 
2001
September 29, 2000

    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 109, a short-term continuing 
resolution for FY 2001.
    The Resolution provides 2001 appropriations for continuing projects 
and activities of the Federal Government through October 6, 2000, except 
for those funded by the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2001, 
and the Military Construction Appropriations Act, 2001, which I have 
signed into law.
    In February, I sent a budget to the Congress that funded critical 
investments in our future. We need realistic levels of funding for 
critical Government functions that the American people expect their 
Government to perform well, including education, law enforcement, 
environmental protection, preservation of our global leadership, air 
safety, food safety, economic assistance for the less fortunate, 
research and technology, administration of Social Security and Medicare, 
and other important programs. None of the funding bills for the programs 
that support these functions have been sent to the White House.
    I urge the Congress to approve the 11 remaining 2001 spending bills 
as quickly as possible, in an acceptable form.

                                                      William J. Clinton

 The White House,

 September 29, 2000.
