Remarks in Chicago on the Terrorist Bombing in Jerusalem
June 11, 2003

    Today there was a terrible bombing in Jerusalem. I send my heartfelt 
condolences to those who suffered and lost life.
    It is clear there are people in the Middle East who hate peace. 
There are people who want to kill in order to make sure that the desires 
of Israel to live in secure and peace don't happen, who kill to make 
sure the desires of the Prime Minister of the Palestinian 
Authority<Abbas, Mahmoud> ``Abu Mazen'' and others of a 
peaceful state living side by side with Israel do not happen.
    To the people in the world who want to see peace in the Middle East, 
I strongly urge all of you to fight off terror, to cut off money to 
organizations such as Hamas,

to isolate those who hate so much that they're willing to kill to stop 
peace from going forward. I strongly condemn the killings, and I urge 
and call upon all of the free world, nations which love peace, to not 
only condemn the killings but to use every ounce of their power to 
prevent them from happening in the future.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:40 a.m. in Grant Park prior to his 
departure from Chicago. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister 
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) of the Palestinian Authority.
