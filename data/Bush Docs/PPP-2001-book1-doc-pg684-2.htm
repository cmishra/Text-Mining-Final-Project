Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Vladimir 
Putin<Putin, Vladimir<ls-thn-eq> of Russia in Kranj
June 16, 2001

    Q. Mr. President, any thoughts about this first meeting?
    President Putin. First impression? It was a good first impression.
    President Bush. I rest my case. [Laughter] We're going to have a 
very good meeting, and I've been looking forward to this for a long 
period of time. We find we have a lot in common, and I'm so honored the 
President came here. I know it's inconvenient to travel such a long 
distance, Mr. President----
    President Putin. We know about the very latest statements of 
President Bush in Warsaw, and that's a very good foundation for us to 
proceed.
    President Bush. Thank you all.

Note: The exchange began at 2:45 p.m. at Brdo Castle. A tape was not
