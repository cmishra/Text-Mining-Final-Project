Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury

    I hereby direct you to exercise your authority under the Terrorism 
Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to propose a rule that would require an 
insurer to obtain your advance approval of any proposed settlement of 
causes of action described in section 107 arising out of or resulting 
from an act of terrorism.

                                                          George W. Bush
