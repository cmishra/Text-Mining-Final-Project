Statement on the Acquittal of Former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy
December 2, 1998

    I am pleased by the jury's verdict today acquitting former Secretary 
of Agriculture Mike Espy of all charges brought by the Independent 
Counsel. Mr. Espy served his country and my administration with 
distinction--first as a Congressman from Mississippi and then as 
Secretary of Agriculture.
    As Secretary, Mike Espy worked hard and successfully to create a 
Department that now better serves the American people. He was a 
relentless champion for America's farmers and consumers. He reached out 
when lives and livelihoods were threatened by natural disasters in rural 
communities and offered relief. He was an advocate for those suffering 
from hunger, and he fought for the environment.
    After what have been challenging times for Mr. Espy, both personally 
and professionally, I am heartened that he has, as he said, emerged from 
this ordeal stronger. I hope that, as he moves forward, he will continue 
his notable record of service to the country.

Note: The statement referred to Independent Counsel Donald C. Smaltz.
