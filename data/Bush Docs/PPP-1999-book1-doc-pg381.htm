Statement on Senator John H. Chafee's<Chafee, John H.> 
Decision Not To Seek Reelection
March 15, 1999

    For more than a generation, Senator John Chafee has been a strong 
leader for his beloved Rhode Island and for America. He has been a 
tireless champion of our environment--helping to lead the fight against 
global warming, promoting wetlands conservation, and crafting 
legislation for clean air and safe drinking water. On behalf of all 
Americans, I thank him for his many contributions, including his 
leadership in expanding health care to more women and children and 
improving services for people with disabilities. It is truly a rich 
legacy for America. Hillary and I wish John and his family all the best 
in the years to come.
