Statement on House Action on Legislation on Education Opportunities
October 21, 1999

    Making our schools work for all America's children is the most 
important challenge we face. By passing H.R. 2 today, the House took an 
important step toward improving educational

opportunities for the Nation's most disadvantaged students. Although I 
have a number of concerns with this bill, I am pleased that H.R. 2 
reflects a bipartisan consensus on several principles of the education 
reform plan I sent Congress earlier this year. As I said in my State of 
the Union Address, the Federal Government has a responsibility not only 
to invest more in our poorest schools, but to demand more results in 
return.
    In particular, the bill continues the work of standards-based 
reform, expands public school choice, and recognizes the importance of 
holding schools accountable for results. I am pleased that a solid 
bipartisan majority in the House voted to reject the false promise of 
vouchers. I am also pleased that the House, by passing the Mink 
amendment, chose to incorporate gender equity provisions in this 
legislation.
    As the reauthorization process continues, I will work with Congress 
to improve certain aspects of this bill, including provisions for 
students with limited English proficiency as well as provisions that 
target funds to our neediest students, increase the quality of Title I 
instructors, and ensure that accountability systems are workable. We 
have more work to do to enact a strong, comprehensive plan to hold 
schools accountable for results. I urge Congress to continue moving 
forward.
