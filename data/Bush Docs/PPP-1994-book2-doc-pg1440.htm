    The President today nominated two individuals to serve on the U.S. 
District Court: Robert N. Chatigny for the District of Connecticut and

    ``Each of these nominees has an exceptional record of legal 
achievement,'' the President said. ``I know they will serve on the 
Federal bench with distinction.''
