Statement on the Death of Barbara Jordan
January 17, 1996

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of our good 
friend Barbara Jordan. Her eloquent voice, which articulated the views 
and concerns of millions of Americans, was always a source of 
inspiration to us. Barbara's words flowed with heartfelt conviction and 
her actions rang of indefatigable determination as she challenged us as 
a nation to confront our weaknesses and live peacefully together as 
equals.
    I am personally appreciative of her efforts to address the difficult 
problem of illegal immigration as Chair of the Commission on Immigration 
Reform. Hillary and I join the University of Texas, the Nation, and all 
those who fight for equal rights and justice in mourning the death of a 
great woman and a gifted public servant. We extend our deepest 
sympathies to her family.
