Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
May 2, 2007

    I thank the leaders and--from Congress for coming down to discuss 
the Iraq funding issue. Yesterday was a day that highlighted 
differences. Today is a day where we can work together to find common 
ground. I will inform the Speaker<Pelosi, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> and the 
leader<Reid, Harry<ls-thn-eq> of our serious intent, and to that end, I 
am going to name our Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten,<Bolten, Joshua 
B.<ls-thn-eq> along with Steve Hadley<Hadley, Stephen J.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Rob Portman,<Portman, Robert Jones<ls-thn-eq> to work with members of 
both parties to fund our troops.
    I think it's very important we do this as quickly as we possibly 
can. I'm confident that we can reach agreement. I know that it's going 
to require good will, but we all care deeply about our country and care 
about this issue. And so I want to thank the Members for coming down 
again. I'm looking forward to our discussions. I'm looking forward to 
what will be constructive set of discussions and negotiations.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 2:46 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
