Joint Statement by President George W. Bush and European Council 
President Konstandinos Simitis<Simitis, Konstandinos> and 
European Commission President Romano Prodi<Prodi, Romano> on 
Transatlantic Aviation Negotiations
June 25, 2003

    We are pleased to announce our agreement to begin comprehensive air 
service negotiations between the United States and the European Union in 
early autumn, following the early June decision of the Council of the 
European Union to approve a negotiating mandate for the Commission. This 
is an historic opportunity to build upon the framework of existing 
agreements with the goal of opening access to markets and maximizing 
benefits for consumers, airlines, and communities on both sides of the 
Atlantic. The United States and the European Union will work together in 
a spirit of cooperation to develop a mutually beneficial approach to 
this crucial economic sector in a globalized economy.
