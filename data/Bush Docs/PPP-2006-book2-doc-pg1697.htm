Remarks Following a Meeting With Business Leaders on the U.S.-Lebanon 
Partnership Fund
September 25, 2006

    I've just had a fascinating discussion with four business leaders 
and members of my administration, all of whom are strategizing on how to 
help the good people of Lebanon recover from the recent crisis.
    Our goal and our mission is to help Lebanese citizens and Lebanese 
businesses not only recover but to flourish, because we believe strongly 
in the concept of a democracy in Lebanon. Right from the beginning of 
the crisis, I had stated that our objective is to help the 
Siniora<Siniora, Fuad<ls-thn-eq> Government--the Siniora Government, 
which is a democratically elected government. And now we've got generous 
citizens of the United States, people who are very busy in their own 
right, who are willing to step forward and to strategize and raise 
monies to help people in Lebanon.
    And this is a very important mission for our country. It's a public/
private partnership. Our Federal Government has committed $250 million; 
OPEC [OPIC],* under Chairman Mosbacher's<Mosbacher, Robert, 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> lead, has arranged financing. And now private sector 
individuals and businesses will work together to send a clear message to 
the Lebanese people: We care about you; we want you to live in a free 
society; we've got great hopes for you; we believe in your Prime 
Minister, Prime Minister Siniora;<Siniora, Fuad<ls-thn-eq> and we will 
back up our words with actions.

    *White House correction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    So I appreciate John Chambers,<Chambers, John T.<ls-thn-eq> who has 
taken the lead for this group, and I appreciate you all taking time to 
go over to Lebanon and show the face of America. We're a compassionate 
people; we care when people suffer; and we care about the type of 
governments that people live under. And we strongly support the young 
democracies in the Middle East; we support the democracy of Lebanon; we 
support the democracy of Iraq. And our dream is one day for there to be 
a Palestinian democracy living side by side in peace with Israel.
    Thank you all very much for your commitment. May God bless the good 
people of Lebanon. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 9:38 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to John T. Chambers, president and 
chief executive officer, Cisco Systems, Inc.
