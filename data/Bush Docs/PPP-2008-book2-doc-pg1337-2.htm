Statement on the 25th Anniversary of the Terrorist Attack on the Marine 
Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon
October 23, 2008

    Twenty-five years ago, a suicide bomb destroyed the Marine barracks 
in Beirut, Lebanon. We remember the 241 American marines, soldiers, and 
sailors who lost their lives in that attack, and we pay tribute to their 
families and loved ones. The U.S. forces in Lebanon were serving as part 
of the multinational force working to bring peace and security to that 
country, torn by years of civil war.
    On the anniversary of this unconscionable attack, we honor the 
memory of those brave service men and women through our commitment to 
succeeding in the war on terror. We express our gratitude to those 
serving abroad to protect America and promote peace and freedom around 
the world. And we reiterate our strong support for the voices of 
moderation and justice in Lebanon.
