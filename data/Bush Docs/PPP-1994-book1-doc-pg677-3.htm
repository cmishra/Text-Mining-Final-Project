    The President today nominated Redding Pitt, a veteran of the Alabama 
attorney general's office, to be U.S. Attorney for the Middle District

    ``Redding Pitt's extensive experience in the field of law and his 
knowledge of Alabama will make an inestimable contribution to the State 
and to the country's judicial system,'' the President said.
