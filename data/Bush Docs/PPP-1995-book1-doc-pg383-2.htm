Memorandum on the 1995 United States Savings Bonds Campaign
March 22, 1995

Memorandum for All Federal Government Employees

Subject: 1995 U.S. Savings Bonds Campaign

    The Federal Government will soon be conducting the 1995 Savings 
Bonds Campaign. This campaign is your chance to sign up for the Payroll 
Savings Plan for U.S. Savings Bonds or to increase your rate of saving 
if you are already participating.
    Getting into the habit of saving money is not easy, no matter how 
hard you try. The Payroll Savings Plan for U.S. Savings Bonds is a 
convenient method of saving regularly that offers tax advantages and 
investment market-based interest rates for small sums of money. When you 
join the plan, you select an amount to be set aside from each paycheck 
to buy bonds. The rest is automatic; you save payday after payday 
without interruption.
    In addition to their direct personal benefits, Savings Bonds also 
help reduce Federal spending. As members of the Government, we must set 
an example for all citizens to follow by establishing a high rate of 
participation in this excellent program.
    Savings Bonds have helped millions of Americans purchase homes, 
finance college educations, guarantee secure retirements, and weather 
financial emergencies. When one of your fellow employees calls on you 
during the campaign, please consider how bonds can help you to achieve 
your own financial goals--then sign up for bonds.

                                                      William J. Clinton
