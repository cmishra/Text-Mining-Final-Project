    The President today announced his intention to nominate Steven 
Kelman, a Harvard professor and advocate for cutting Government waste 
through better purchasing policies, as Administrator for Federal 
Procurement Policy at the Office of Management and Budget.
    ``With his background and commitment to making the Government more 
efficient, I know Steven Kelman will ensure Government purchases are 
made economically and with care,'' the President said.

Press Secretary.
