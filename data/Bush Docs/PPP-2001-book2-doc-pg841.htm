Statement on House Ways and Means Committee Action on Faith-Based and 
Community Initiatives Legislation
July 11, 2001

    I commend the House Ways and Means Committee for passing legislation 
today that includes key elements of my Faith-Based and Community 
Initiatives. This clears the

way for consideration by the full House of Representatives. This 
legislation will stimulate more charitable giving and support faith-
based and community organizations in their efforts to help those in 
need. I will continue to work on a bipartisan basis with Members of the 
House and the Senate to implement my Faith-Based and Community 
Initiatives.
