Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President Turgut Ozal 
of Turkey
February 8, 1993

Tax Payment for Domestic Help

    Q. Mr. President, are you now going to ask all of your Cabinet 
Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries whether they have paid Social 
Security taxes and whether they ever had hired any illegal domestic 
help?
    The President. I've handled that through the White House Legal 
Counsel. I think Mr. Stephanopoulos has already given a statement about 
it.
    Q. Do you feel confident that everyone will now pay back taxes?
    The President. I do. I think everybody will do what they're supposed 
to do.
    Q. Sir, when are you going to----

Bosnia

    Q. Sir, when do you expect to have a statement on Bosnia?
    The President. We're very close. I don't want to give you a specific 
time, but we're very close. As you know, we've done an awful lot of work 
on it. I spent a lot of time on it last week and a considerable amount 
of time today. So we're quite close.
    Q. Do you think this week you might have a diplomatic initiative?
    The President. I think we might be prepared to make a statement in 
the next few days, yes.

Note: The President spoke at 2:04 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House.
