Teleconference Remarks With Senate Republican Leaders
November 19, 2002

    Senator Trent Lott.<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> [Inaudible]
    The President. Well, I appreciate that, Trent. And I want to thank 
you all for working hard. We're making great progress in the war on 
terror. Part of that progress will be the ability for us to protect the 
American people at home. This is a very important piece of legislation. 
It is landmark in its scope, and it ends a session which has been 2 
years' worth of legislative work, which has been very productive for the 
American people.
    Senator Lott.<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> [Inaudible]
    The President. Well, I want to thank you all. It is an honor to be 
representing the greatest country on the face of the Earth over in 
Europe. And we're going to have an historic day on Thursday when we go 
to expand NATO. The people of Europe appreciate America. They appreciate 
our strength, and most importantly, they appreciate our compassion and 
our love for freedom. And I know you all share that side of America with 
me.
    Again, I want to thank all the Senators in the room there for your 
hard work and look forward to seeing you when I get back.
    Senator Lott.<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> [Inaudible]
    The President. All right, well thank----

legislation will help put hardhats back to work, and that's going to be 
good, and I appreciate you working on that as well.
