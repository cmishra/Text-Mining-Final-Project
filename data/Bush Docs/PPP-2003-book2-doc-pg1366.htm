    Mr. Prime Minister, thanks. It's so gracious of you to host us, and 
it's a chance for me to say to the Singapore people how much we 
appreciate our friendship. And I appreciate our personal relationship, 
Mr. Prime Minister.

    The Prime Minister is a wise man. He understands Southeast Asia very 
well. And a lot of our discussion was about how we continue to foster 
our agenda, which is one of peace and freedom as well as prosperity 
through trade.
    I appreciate your good advice, and I want to thank you for your warm 
hospitality. It's a magnificent country you have here. We're honored to 
be here. Thank you again.

Note: The President spoke at 8:55 p.m. at the Istana. A tape was not
