Remarks Following a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
December 8, 2006

    I want to thank the Members of Congress--both Houses, both political 
parties--for joining me and the Vice President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> 
and members of my team. We just had a very constructive conversation. We 
talked about Iraq. We talked about the need for a new way forward in 
Iraq, and we talked about the need to work together on this important 
subject. We also talked about other key issues.
    I assured the leaders that the White House door will be open when 
the new Congress shows up. And I think we ought to meet on a regular 
basis; I believe there's consensus toward that. And the reason you meet 
on a regular basis is so that the American people can know that we're 
working hard to find common ground. That's what they expect us to do; 
they expect us to work on big problems and solve them.
    I want to say something about my two friends here. Senator 
Frist,<Frist, Bill<ls-thn-eq> we appreciate your service to the United 
States of America. You brought a lot of dignity to the office. And I 
appreciate the Speaker<Hastert, J. Dennis<ls-thn-eq> being,

as well--Mr. Speaker, you've done a fine job as Speaker.
    I look forward to working with Senator Reid<Reid, Harry<ls-thn-eq> 
and Congresswoman Pelosi<Pelosi, Nancy<ls-thn-eq> for doing what's right 
for the country. And again, I want to thank you all for coming down. I 
appreciate your interest, appreciate your advice, appreciate the input 
that you've given.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 9:16 a.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
