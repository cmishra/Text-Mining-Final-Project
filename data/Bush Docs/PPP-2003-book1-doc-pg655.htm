Remarks at the Congressional Picnic
June 18, 2003

    The President. Listen, thank you all for coming. Laura<Bush, 
Laura> and I and Dick<Cheney, Dick> and 
Lynne<Cheney, Lynne> are so happy you all are here. And we're 
really happy it's not raining. [Laughter]
    Audience member. [Inaudible]
    The President. I bet you are.
    First, we're so thrilled that Dennis Edwards<Edwards, 
Dennis> and the Temptations Review has joined us tonight. We 
expect to see some serious rug-cutting or, in this case, grass-cutting. 
[Laughter]
    We do want to thank the families who are here. We're so grateful for 
the wives and husbands of the Members of the Senate and the Congress for 
being so patient with your loved ones and for supporting them in their 
service to the United States of America. We want to thank the sons and 
daughters as well for understanding your dad and your mom are serving 
something greater than themselves in life.
    I want to thank all the Members of Congress from both political 
parties for doing such a fine job on behalf of the United States of 
America. You know what I know: We're blessed to live in a great country. 
And one of the things that makes us great is we've got tremendous 
values. We believe in freedom, respect for others, personal 
responsibility. And today is a day for us all to come together and to 
celebrate those fantastic values and for us--for Laura<Bush, 
Laura> and me and for Dick<Cheney, Dick> and<Cheney, 
Lynne> Lynne--to thank you on behalf of a grateful nation for 
serving our country so well.
    May God bless you and your families, and may God continue to bless 
the United States of America.
    Enjoy yourselves.

Note: The President spoke at 6:10 p.m. on the South Grounds at the White 
House.
