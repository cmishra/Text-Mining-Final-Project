Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Federal Funding 
Accountability and Transparency Legislation
September 13, 2006

    I applaud the House for today's passage of S. 2590, the ``Federal 
Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006,'' and look forward 
to final passage by the Senate soon. This legislation demonstrates 
Congress's commitment to giving the American people access to timely and 
accurate information about how their tax dollars are spent.
    This bill builds on existing administration initiatives to help 
ensure Federal agencies clearly reflect how they spend the taxpayers' 
money. Expectmore.gov is one such resource, allowing Americans to see 
which Federal programs are successful and which ones fall short.
    In addition to these reforms, I urge the Senate to follow the House 
in passing the line item veto, a critical tool that will help rein in 
wasteful spending and bring greater transparency to the budget process. 
I call on the Senate to pass this important legislation this month.
