Statement on the Death of Former President Gerald R. Ford<Ford, Gerald 
R.<ls-thn-eq>
December 26, 2006

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are greatly saddened by the 
passing of former President Gerald R. Ford.
    President Ford was a great American who gave many years of dedicated 
service to our country. On August 9, 1974, after a long career in the 
House of 
Representatives and service as Vice President, he assumed the Presidency 
in an hour of national turmoil and division. With his quiet integrity, 
common sense, and kind instincts, President Ford helped heal our land 
and restore public confidence in the Presidency.
    The American people will always admire Gerald Ford's devotion to 
duty, his personal character, and the honorable conduct of his 
administration. We mourn the loss of such a leader, and our 38th 
President will always have a special place in our Nation's memory.
    On behalf of all Americans, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I offer 
our deepest sympathies to Betty Ford<Ford, Elizabeth A.<ls-thn-eq> and 
all of President Ford's family. Our thoughts and prayers will be with 
them in the hours and days ahead.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
