 Remarks Prior to Discussions With President Vladimir Putin<Putin, 
Vladimir<ls-thn-eq> of Russia in Busan, South Korea
 November 18, 2005

     President Putin. Distinguished Mr. President, allow me to cordially 
welcome you and your colleagues. And I get impression that with some of 
your colleagues, I never said goodbye. [Laughter] And it is very 
pleasant indeed, that with these colleagues, we virtually had permanent 
contacts on almost all bilateral and international issues.
     And I'm especially pleased to have this meeting with you here in 
South Korea. You stayed here for quite a while, and probably you will 
tell me of your impressions.
     President Bush. That's right. Thank you.
    Well, thanks, Vladimir, for hosting this meeting. I always enjoy a 
chance to have a good discussion with you. You're right;

value the strategic relationship we've built. So thanks--thanks again 
for hosting this.
