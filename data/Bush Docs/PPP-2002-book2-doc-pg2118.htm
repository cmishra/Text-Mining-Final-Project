Remarks on Receiving the Star of Romania in Bucharest, Romania
November 23, 2002

    Mr. President,<Iliescu, Ion<ls-thn-eq> thank you so much for this 
honor. I accept the Star of Romania on behalf of my country, and I 
appreciate the spirit of friendship that this award represents.
    I want to thank the Prime Minister<Nastase, Adrian<ls-thn-eq> and 
members of your Government for such fine hospitality.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are honored to be here, and so is 
my Cabinet--members of my Cabinet, as well as senior members of my 
staff. We're here because America and the nations of the world have seen 
the courage and character of the Romanian people. You have liberated 
yourselves from tyranny. You're building a vibrant democracy. And you're 
preparing to join NATO. In all these events of history, America has been 
your friend, and we'll be proud to call you Ally.
    Mr. President,<Iliescu, Ion<ls-thn-eq> Romania and America share 
common values and common challenges. We will join together to open 
markets, to build a new relationship with Russia, to confront global 
terrorism, and to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
Europe and America face unprecedented dangers to our security, and we 
will face these dangers together.
    The Romanian people have made a great effort to meet the standards 
of NATO membership. That effort is succeeding. America respects all that 
you have done and all that you will do in the cause of freedom. And 
America will be your partner in continuing the work of reform.
    On behalf of the American people, I proudly affirm the close 
relationship between our countries, and I thank you for

Nastase of Romania.
