Statement on the Death of Senator Craig L. Thomas<Thomas, Craig 
L.<ls-thn-eq>
June 5, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of Wyoming Senator Craig Thomas. During nearly 23 years of public 
service as a Senator, Congressman, and State legislator, Senator Thomas 
was a tireless and effective advocate for the people of his beloved home 
State. He was a man of character and integrity, known for his devotion 
to the values he shared with the people of Wyoming. He leaves a lasting 
legacy as a guardian of Wyoming's lands and resources and our country's 
national parks. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Senator Thomas's wife 
Susan,<Thomas, Susan<ls-thn-eq> his family, and friends.
