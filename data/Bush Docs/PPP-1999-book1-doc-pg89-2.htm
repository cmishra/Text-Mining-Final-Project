Statement on the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Conflict
January 22, 1999

    The United States remains deeply concerned about the risk of armed 
conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia and strongly committed to help 
find a peaceful resolution to their border dispute.
    As part of this effort, I asked former National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake<Lake, Anthony> to return to Eritrea and Ethiopia 
during the last week. This was his fourth visit since October. During 
his visit, Mr. Lake met with Organization of African Unity (OAU) 
Secretary Salim Ahmed Salim,<Salim, Salim Ahmed> Eritrean 
President Isaias Afworki,<Isaias Afworki> and Ethiopian Prime 
Minister Meles Zenawi.<Meles Zenawi>
    In their meetings with Mr. Lake,<Lake, Anthony> the 
leaders of Eritrea<Isaias Afworki> and Ethiopia<Meles 
Zenawi> reaffirmed their engagement with the OAU's peace 
process, which the United States strongly supports. In this context, the 
United States urges both parties to accept the OAU's Framework Agreement 
and its agreed implementation in order to achieve a peaceful resolution 
of the dispute. Ethiopia has accepted the OAU Framework, and Eritrea 
awaits certain clarifications from the OAU.
    The United States remains deeply concerned, however, about the 
continuing military buildup along the common border between Ethiopia and 
Eritrea, and about the implications of this buildup for renewed 
hostilities. We call on both parties to exercise reason and restraint 
and to maintain their commitment to the peaceful solution that we are 
convinced is within reach.
    Ethiopia and Eritrea have made remarkable strides in the last few 
years in overcoming a past of repression, famine, and war. Both nations 
have promising futures. Both are good friends of the United States. We 
ask them not to risk what they have gained in a conflict that cannot 
possibly benefit the people of either side. We pledge our own best 
efforts, in partnership with Ethiopia and Eritrea, to avert a tragedy 
and to advance the interests that continue to unite the people of both 
nations.
