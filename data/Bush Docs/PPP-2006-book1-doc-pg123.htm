Statement on the Death of President Ibrahim Rugova<Rugova, 
Ibrahim<ls-thn-eq> of Kosovo
January 23, 2006

    I am deeply saddened by the death of President Ibrahim Rugova. For 
many years, President Rugova led the campaign for peace and democracy in 
Kosovo. He was a friend of the United States, and he earned the world's 
respect for his principled stand against violence. Throughout years of 
conflict, he was a voice of reason and moderation that helped Kosovo's 
people lay the groundwork for a peaceful future. The United States 
remains committed to working with the people of Kosovo to build a future 
that is stable, democratic, and prosperous. On behalf of the people of 
the United States, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I extend our 
condolences to President Rugova's family and to the people of Kosovo.
