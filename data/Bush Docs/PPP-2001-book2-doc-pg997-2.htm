Remarks to Harley-Davidson Employees in Menomonee Falls
 August 20, 2001

     I really appreciate your hospitality. First of all, I'm really 
impressed by the quality of the workers who are here. It's obviously 
reflected in the quality of the product. Harley-Davidson is uniquely 
American. People love them. And some people are bold enough to drive 
them, and some of us aren't. [Laughter] I'm hitting the speed limit this

say hello. I can't tell you how great it is to be the President of the 
greatest country on the face of the Earth. I thank all the--there are

you and your family.'' For those of you that do that, thanks. It really 
is something unique about America--you don't have to show me the party 
registration card. It's really one of the fabulous parts of the job--
people from all walks that really care enough about the Presidency that 
they will do that. I'm just going to keep giving it my best shot. I'm 
not going to try to figure out which way the wind is blowing--all come 
down and visit me in Texas.

  Note:  The President spoke at 1:15 p.m. in the lunchroom at the 
Harley-Davidson Pilgrim Road Powertrain Operations factory. A tape was 
not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
