Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With President
Hafiz al-Asad of Syria in Damascus
October 27, 1994

    Q. Gentlemen, do you think you will be able to agree on new steps 
toward peace today? President Asad?
    President Asad. We hope so. If we don't have this desire, we 
wouldn't have any incentive for such a meeting. And so the peace process 
needs efforts, and it always has its own difficulties. People think that 
with a magic word they might be able to achieve peace, but this is not 
possible.
    President Clinton. Thank you. We're working hard.

Note: The exchange began at approximately 9:15 a.m. at the Presidential 
Palace. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this 
exchange.
