Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
March 6, 1995

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through November 
30, 1994. The current report covers December 1, 1994, through January 
31, 1995.
    On January 5, I appointed Mr. Richard I. Beattie as my U.S. Special 
Presidential Emissary for Cyprus. Emissary Beattie will work closely 
with all parties to promote an overall solution that will be fair, just, 
and permanent. He and Special Cyprus Coordinator James Williams traveled 
to Cyprus on January 23 for extensive meetings with the leaders of both 
communities. The two leaders expressed their desire to reach a 
settlement. In addition, Mr. Denktash reiterated his commitment to a 
bizonal, bicommunal federation with a single sovereignty and single 
citizenship. Emissary Beattie and Special Cyprus Coordinator Williams 
will consult in Ankara dur-

ing March to continue their efforts to facilitate agreements on concrete 
steps towards a solution.
    Throughout the period, my representatives continued to work for 
comprehensive progress, both on concrete steps such as the confidence-
building measures and on overall settlement issues. The Greek-Cypriot 
side endorsed this approach provided a common basis for an overall 
settlement has been established; the Turkish-Cypriot side urged we 
proceed incrementally from measures to overall talks. We will continue 
to pursue further efforts to establish such a common basis for a 
settlement.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
