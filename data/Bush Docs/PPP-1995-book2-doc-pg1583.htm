Statement on Signing the Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of 1995
October 12, 1995

    I am pleased to sign into law today S. 895, the ``Small Business 
Lending Enhancement Act of 1995.'' This Act would, among other things, 
establish new guarantee levels for guaranteed loan programs of the Small 
Business Administration (SBA).
    S. 895, which the Congress passed at my Administration's urging, 
contains important elements of the Vice President's National Performance 
Review proposals and SBA's reinvention proposal. The Act is also 
consistent with recommendations from this spring's White House 
Conference on Small Business.
    S. 895 reduces the Government's cost of small business financing, 
thereby enabling even more customers to be served. With the program 
reforms contained in this Act, SBA will be able to extend up to $33 
million in additional loan guarantees per day with no additional cost to 
the taxpayer.
    I am pleased to sign this measure into law because it reflects my 
Administration's commit-

The White House,

October 12, 1995.

Note: S. 895, approved October 12, was assigned Public Law No. 104-36.
