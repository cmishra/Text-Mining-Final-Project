    The President today announced his intent to nominate Susan Ness as a 
member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
    ``As a former communications lender, Susan Ness brings to the FCC 
valuable perspective. Her extensive experience covers many 
communications industry sectors including telecommunications, radio, 
television, cable television, programming and publishing,'' the 
President said. ``She will be an excellent addition to this important 
Commission.''
