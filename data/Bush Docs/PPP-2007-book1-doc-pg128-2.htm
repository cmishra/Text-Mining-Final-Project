Statement on the Death of Charlie Norwood<Norwood, Charles W., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq>
February 13, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of Congressman Charlie Norwood. Charlie was a good friend and a strong, 
spirited legislator who always stuck to his principles, remembering that 
his duty was to represent the best interests of the citizens of his 
district. Throughout his seven terms in Congress, he was a strong 
advocate for patients' rights, high-quality education, and protecting 
the homeland. As a lawmaker, he had the ability to deliver on

his promises. I enjoyed working with him and valued our close 
friendship.
    After becoming ill, Charlie demonstrated his extraordinary strength 
by continuing to serve our Nation with the same dedication. He was a 
good man and a true patriot.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our prayers to Charlie's 
wife Gloria<Norwood, Gloria<ls-thn-eq> and his children and 
grandchildren.
