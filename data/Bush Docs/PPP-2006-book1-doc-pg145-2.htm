Statement on the Death of Coretta Scott King<King, Coretta 
Scott<ls-thn-eq>
January 31, 2006

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of Coretta Scott King. Mrs. King was a remarkable and courageous woman 
and a great civil rights leader. She carried on the legacy of her 
husband, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., including through her 
extraordinary work at the King Center. Mrs. King's lasting contributions 
to freedom and equality have made America a better and more 
compassionate nation. Laura and I were fortunate to have known Mrs. 
King, and we will always treasure the time we spent with her. We send 
our condolences and prayers to the entire King family.
