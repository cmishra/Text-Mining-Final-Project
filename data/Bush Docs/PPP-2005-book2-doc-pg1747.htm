Remarks Following a Church Service in Beijing, China
November 20, 2005

    The President. Pastor,<Ying Dufeng<ls-thn-eq> Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I thank you very much for your hospitality. Our 
friend Luis Palau,<Palau, Luis<ls-thn-eq> from America, is here as well. 
And you gave a great sermon.
    Pastor Ying Dufeng. Thank you.
    The President. The spirit of the Lord is very strong inside your 
church. We thank you for carrying a message of love, like you did.
    You know, it wasn't all that long ago that people were not allowed 
to worship openly in this society. My hope is that the Government of 
China will not fear the Christians who gather to worship openly. A 
healthy society is a society that welcomes all faiths and gives people a 
chance to express themselves through worship with the Almighty. So we 
welcome--we really thank you for letting us come by, and we ask for 
God's blessings on you and your church.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:22 a.m. at Gangwashi Protestant Church. 
In his remarks, he referred to Ying Dufeng, pastor, Gangwashi Protestant 
Church; and Luis Palau, founder, Luis Palau Association.
