Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Continued Operations of 
United States Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina
May 12, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 1203 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization 
Act For Fiscal Year 1999, Public Law 105-261 (the Act), requires 
submission of a report to the Congress whenever the President submits a 
request for funds for continued operations of U.S. forces in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina.
    In connection with my Administration's request for funds for FY 
2000, the attached report fulfills the requirements of section 1203 of 
the Act.
    I want to emphasize again my continued commitment to close 
consultation with the Congress on political and military matters 
concerning Bosnia and Herzegovina. I look forward to continuing to work 
with the Congress in the months ahead as we work to establish a lasting 
peace in the Balkans.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

May 12, 1999.
