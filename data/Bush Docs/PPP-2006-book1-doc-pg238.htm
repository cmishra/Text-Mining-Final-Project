Statement on the Anniversary of the Death of Former Prime Minister Rafiq 
Hariri of Lebanon
February 14, 2006

    One year ago today, former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri was 
assassinated. Mr. Hariri was a great Lebanese patriot who worked to 
rebuild a free, independent, and prosperous Lebanon after years of 
brutal civil war. Our thoughts are with the people of Lebanon as they 
mark this anniversary.
    Lebanon has continued to make progress in the year since Mr. 
Hariri's murder, thanks to the foundation of freedom he laid and the 
determination of the Lebanese people. Lebanon has conducted a free and 
fair parliamentary election and begun economic reforms. Great challenges 
remain, and the United States will continue to stand with the people of 
Lebanon as they strive to build a free and democratic future.
