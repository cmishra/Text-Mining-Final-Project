Message to the Senate Transmitting the Trinidad and Tobago-
United States Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty With Documentation
September 3, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of 
the United States of America and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago 
on Mutual Legal

[[Page 1129]]

Assistance in Criminal Matters, signed at Port of Spain on March 4, 
1996. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of 
the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
    The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance 
treaties being negotiated by the United States in order to counter 
criminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective 
tool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of crimes, including 
drug trafficking offenses. The Treaty is self-executing.
    The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal 
matters. Mutual assistance available under the Treaty includes: taking 
of testimony or statements of persons; providing documents, records, and 
articles of evidence; serving documents; locating or identifying 
persons; transferring persons in custody for testimony or other 
purposes; executing requests for searches and seizures; assisting in 
proceedings related to restraint, confiscation, forfeiture of assets, 
restitution, and collection of fines; examining objects and sites; and 
any other form of assistance not prohibited by the laws of the Requested 
State.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

September 3, 1997.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
September 4.
