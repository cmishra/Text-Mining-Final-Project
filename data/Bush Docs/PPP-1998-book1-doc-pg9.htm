Statement on the Death of Manuel Zurita<Zurita, Manuel<ls-thn-eq>
January 7, 1998

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Customs 
Senior Special Agent Manuel Zurita. We are eternally grateful for the 
courage and bravery of the men and women who protect us each and every 
day. This tragic accident painfully reminds us of the risks our law 
enforcement officials face keeping our country safe.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife and their four children 
as they deal with this devastating loss.

Note: Agent Zurita was fatally injured in a January 1 boat accident 
while aboard a U.S. Customs Service vessel providing security for the 
President's arrival in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.
