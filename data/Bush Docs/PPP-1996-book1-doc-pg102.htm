Statement on the Resignation of Roger Johnson as Administrator of 
General Services
January 25, 1996

    I learned of Roger Johnson's resignation as Administrator of the 
General Services Administration with deep regret. He served his country 
with distinction over the last 3 years, bringing a common-sense approach 
and let's-get-down-to-business style to the GSA.

    He worked closely with the Vice President and the staff of the 
National Performance Review to implement real reforms at the GSA. 
Because of his work, today's GSA provides better service with a smaller 
bureaucracy and lower operating costs. We will continue to build on the 
work Roger started.
    At a time when all Americans need to come together and confront our 
common challenges, we need people like Roger Johnson--a long-time 
Republican, a business leader--more than ever. Even as he leaves the 
Government, I hope public servants everywhere remember his example: to 
put partisan differences aside and work for the common good.

    Hillary and I wish Roger and Janice nothing but the best as they 
return to California. I am deeply gratified by his kind words and look 
forward to working with Roger in the months ahead.
