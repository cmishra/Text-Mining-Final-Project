Statement on Congressional Action on Federal Aviation Reauthorization 
Legislation
October 3, 1996

    In passing the Federal Aviation Authorization Act today, Congress 
has responded to my request to act quickly on the recommendations of the 
Gore commission and approved an important piece of legislation that will 
improve the security of our airports and airlines.
    Because of this legislation, criminal background checks can now be 
conducted on airport personnel, new explosives detection technology can 
be deployed, baggage will be checked more thoroughly, passenger 
profiling will be instituted, and families who lose a loved one in an 
accident will be able to get the help that they need.
    I congratulate the Congress and I thank the Vice President, as well 
as Secretary Pena and his team, for making this important legislation a 
reality which I look forward to signing into law.
