Statement on Federal Funding for the Homeless
October 14, 1994

    I am pleased to announce the release of these much-needed funds to 
help feed, shelter, and give a hand up to America's homeless. By 
involving local community organizations as we decide where to best 
allocate these resources, we will ensure that the most urgent needs in 
our communities are met.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the release of $130 million in funding to feed and shelter the homeless.
