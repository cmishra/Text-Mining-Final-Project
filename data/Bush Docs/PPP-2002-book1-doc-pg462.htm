Statement on the Death of John Robson<Robson, John>
March 20, 2002

    I am deeply saddened by the death of John Robson. John was a man of 
true character and integrity. Serving four Presidents with dedication 
and honor, most recently as Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, John set 
an example of distinguished public service. I extend my deepest 
sympathies to his wife, Margaret,<Robson, Margaret> and to his 
son, Doug.<Robson, Doug> He will be missed.
