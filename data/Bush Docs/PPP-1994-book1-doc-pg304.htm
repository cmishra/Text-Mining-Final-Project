Statement on the Technology Reinvestment Project
February 23, 1994

    This marks another major step in our effort to protect our national 
security and promote our economic security in the post-cold-war world. 
We are investing in projects that will create the jobs of the future by 
exploring ideas, developing technologies, creating products, and 
strengthening skills that will keep America strong, militarily and 
economically.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the fourth group of awards in the technology reinvestment project.
