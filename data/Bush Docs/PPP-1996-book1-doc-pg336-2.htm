Statement on the Peace Vigil in Northern Ireland
February 25, 1996

    Today, I join the people of Northern Ireland as you gather together 
in a mass vigil for peace. From where I stood last November in Belfast, 
to cities on both sides of the Atlantic, citizens are standing up for an 
end to violence and for the right of the people of Northern Ireland to a 
normal life.
    The bombs that shattered the cease-fire and murdered and maimed 
innocent people in London must not be the path of the future. As today's 
outpouring of support underscores, the people want peace. They deserve 
peace, and we must all work to help them achieve this goal. Those who 
seek to use violence and terror should hear the voices of today's vigil 
being conducted across our lands: no to violence, yes to peace.
    The United States continues to work with the Irish and British 
Governments and the parties to help the people of Northern Ireland 
achieve that goal. I commend all those who are standing today for peace. 
My hopes and prayers are with you in that effort.
