Statement on Signing the Continuing Appropriations Resolution
October 21, 1993

    Today I have signed into law H.J. Res. 281, a Continuing Resolution 
that funds the operations of the Federal Government during October 22-
28, 1993.
    A Continuing Resolution is necessary at this time in order to keep 
the Government functioning while the Congress completes the 
appropriations process.
    I commend the Congress for presenting me with a funding measure that 
provides for a simple, temporary extension of normal government 
operations and is free of extraneous amendments. I urge the Congress to 
complete the regular appropriations process by October 28th so that an 
additional Continuing Resolution can be avoided.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
October 21, 1993.

Note: H.J. Res. 281, approved October 21, was assigned Public Law No. 
103-113. This statement was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on October 22.
