Statement on the Terrorist Attack in Islamabad, Pakistan
September 20, 2008

    I strongly condemn the terrorist bombing in Islamabad that targeted 
and killed many innocents, including at least one American. I extend 
condolences to the families of all those killed in this brutal attack.
    This bombing, the latest in a series of terrorist attacks, is part 
of a continuing assault on the people of Pakistan. This attack is a 
reminder of the ongoing threat faced by Pakistan, the United States, and 
all those who stand against violent extremism. We will assist Pakistan 
in confronting this threat and bringing the perpetrators to justice. We 
will fully support the democratically elected Government of Pakistan and 
the Pakistani people as they face enormous challenges economically as 
well as from terrorism.
