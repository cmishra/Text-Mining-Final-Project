    The President. I got an update from Tony Blair<Blair, 
Tony> on where things are, and we're now in touch with the 
various parties, and I expect to make some more phone calls sometime in 
the next hour or so. It's an all-nighter.
    Q. Will the talks be extended tonight?
    The President. Yes, I think by most standards they've already been 
extended. But I do expect so. I think they'll work quite late.

she's a big Cubs fan?

have to share wearing rights.
