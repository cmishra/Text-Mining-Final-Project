Statement on the Death of W. Hamilton M. Jordan<Jordan, W. Hamilton 
M.<ls-thn-eq>
May 21, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by the death of 
Hamilton Jordan. Hamilton Jordan was a man whose love for American 
politics and his country took him at a young age from the State capitol 
in Georgia to the White House. As President Carter's<Carter, James E., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq> close adviser, Hamilton played an important role in 
shaping our Nation's policies. We value his service to our country.
    Hamilton Jordan was also a great community leader, using lessons 
learned during his personal struggle against cancer to encourage other 
cancer survivors to remain optimistic and embrace the blessings of each 
day. Through their work with Camp Sunshine, he and his wife 
Dorothy<Jordan, Dorothy Henry<ls-thn-eq> have helped thousands of 
children enjoy life as they cope with the challenges of cancer.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with the Jordan family.
