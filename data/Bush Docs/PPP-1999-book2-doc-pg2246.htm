Statement on Signing the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System 
Act
December 9, 1999

    I am pleased to sign into law S. 1866, the ``John H. Chafee Coastal 
Barrier Resources System Act.'' Renaming the Coastal Barrier Resources 
System in Senator Chafee's honor is an appropriate tribute to a man who 
worked so hard--and so successfully--to find common ground in the 
struggle to protect and preserve the environment for future generations.
    Senator Chafee authored the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, a law 
which protects pristine and fragile coastal barriers from development by 
restricting Federal expenditures that would otherwise encourage such 
development. This Act has successfully minimized the loss of human life 
by discouraging development in high-risk areas. It also has reduced the 
wasteful expenditures of Federal resources and protected the natural 
resources associated with coastal barriers. Today, approximately 3 
million acres of fragile coastal barrier lands are part of the Coastal 
Barrier Resources System created by the Act.
    Senator Chafee's legacy of achievements in environmental protection 
is extraordinary and far ranging. He worked tirelessly to ensure the 
protection of our land, air, and water and he took special pride in the 
success of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act. For this reason, it is 
especially fitting that we honor Senator Chafee by renaming the Coastal 
Barrier Resources System as the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources 
System.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

December 9, 1999.

Note: H.R. 1866, approved December 9, was assigned Public Law No. 106-
167.
