Letter to the President of the Senate Reporting a Certification 
Regarding NATO Invitee Croatia
November 21, 2008

Dear Mr. President:
    Consistent with the condition set forth in the Senate resolution of 
advice and consent to ratification of the Protocols to the North 
Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of Croatia of 
September 25, 2008, and based on the recommendation of the Department of 
State, I hereby certify to the Senate that:
       (i)   the inclusion of the Republic of Croatia in the North 
            Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will not have the effect 
            of increasing the overall percentage share of the United 
            States in the common budgets of NATO; and
      (ii)   the inclusion of the Republic of Croatia in NATO does not 
            detract from the ability of the United States to meet or to 
            fund its military requirements outside the North Atlantic 
            area.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
