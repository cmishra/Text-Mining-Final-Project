    The President. I am so pleased that upon the recommendations of the 
Secretary of State Designee Rice<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> that Bob 
Zoellick has agreed to serve as Deputy Secretary of State upon 
confirmation by the Senate. Condi Rice and Bob Zoellick will form one of 
the really strong, capable foreign policy teams our country has ever 
had.

    I've known Zoellick for a long time. He's a--he is a fine public 
servant. I asked him to serve as our trade minister, and he did a 
fantastic job. And as he departs to the State Department, upon Senate 
confirmation, I want to assure the American people this administration 
is committed to free trade. I look forward to finding a replacement for 
Bob Zoellick that will be able to carry on our desire to spread free 
trade around the world.
    In the meantime, I look forward to a quick confirmation for Condi 
and Bob so they can go over to the State Department and carry on the 
foreign policy of this administration. Thank you all very much.
    Thanks for serving.
    Ambassador Zoellick. Thank you, Mr. President.
    The President. Glad you're going to do it.
    Ambassador Zoellick. Thanks.
    Secretary-designate Rice.<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> Mr.

    Secretary-designate Rice.<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> Thank you, 
sir.
    The President. Thank you all. See you in Detroit.
