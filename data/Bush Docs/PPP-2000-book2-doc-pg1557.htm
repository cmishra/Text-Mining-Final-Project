Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
August 3, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period April 1-May 31, 2000. The previous 
submission covered events during February and March 2000.
    Following President Clerides' surgery in early May, the United 
Nations rescheduled the recommencement of Cyprus talks for July 5 in 
Geneva. Despite this delay, U.S. officials remained actively engaged in 
efforts to bring about a comprehensive Cyprus settlement based on a 
bizonal, bicommunal federation. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
underscored the United States commitment to a Cyprus solution with her 
Greek and Turkish counterparts in early May.
    Special Presidential Emissary Alfred H. Moses, Special Cyprus 
Coordinator Thomas G. Weston, and U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald K. 
Bandler reinforced these messages with the Greek Cypriot and Turkish 
Cypriot leadership and urged all parties to support positive movement in 
the United Nations-sponsored talks.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on August 4.
