February 8, 2007

    I am pleased that the Senate, with strong bipartisan support, has 
confirmed several key members of my national security team. America will 
benefit from the leadership of Mike McConnell<McConnell, J. 
Michael<ls-thn-eq> as Director of National Intelligence, General George 
Casey<Casey, George W., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> as Chief of Staff of the United 
States Army, and Admiral William Fallon<Fallon, William J.<ls-thn-eq> as 
commander of U.S. Central Command.
    Mike McConnell<McConnell, J. Michael<ls-thn-eq> is an experienced 
and proven leader who will continue implementing historic reforms of 
America's intelligence community designed to ensure we receive timely, 
accurate information on threats to our country. General Casey's<Casey, 
George W., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> extensive knowledge of our military challenges 
and capabilities will enable him to lead our soldiers in successful 
pursuit of their mission. Admiral Fallon<Fallon, William J.<ls-thn-eq> 
is an innovative thinker who will skillfully guide our military 
commanders as we confront our enemies in the war on terror.
    I look forward to working with each of these strong leaders in 
combating terrorism and protecting the American people.
