Statement on the Death of Jeane J. Kirkpatrick<Kirkpatrick, Jeane 
J.<ls-thn-eq>
December 8, 2006

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of Jeane Kirkpatrick. As a professor, author, ambassador, and adviser to 
Presidents, she influenced the thinking of generations of Americans on 
the importance of American leadership in advancing the cause of freedom 
and democracy around the globe. She defended the cause of freedom at a 
pivotal time in world history, and her courageous service as our United 
Nations Ambassador inspired her fellow Americans and lovers of liberty 
around the world. Jeane's powerful intellect helped America win the cold 
war. Her insights and teachings will continue to illuminate the path 
ahead for the United States in the world. We send our condolences to 
Jeane's family and friends, and on behalf of all Americans, we give 
thanks for her extraordinary life.
