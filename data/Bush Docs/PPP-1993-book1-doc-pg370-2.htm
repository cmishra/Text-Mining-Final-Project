Exchange With Reporters Prior to a Meeting With Congressional Leaders
April 1, 1993

    Q. Mr. President, is your stimulus package in trouble? That's what 
we hear.
    The President. Well, we just passed the budget, but I'm celebrating 
that right now. I think we can pass it. We'll keep working on it. We 
have to have 60 votes to pass it, but we'll keep working on it.
    We're here talking about Russia today.

Note: The exchange began at 10:30 a.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of this 
exchange.
