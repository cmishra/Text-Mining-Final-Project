Message on the Observance of Easter 2006
April 13, 2006

    ``He is not here; for He is risen, as He said.''

                                                            Matthew 28:6

    I send greetings to those observing the joyous holiday of Easter. On 
Easter, Christians around the world join together with family and 
friends to celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and the triumph of 
love over death. This is a season of renewal, a time for giving thanks 
and praise and for remembering that hope overcomes despair.
    Christ's extraordinary sacrifice and compassion continue to inspire 
people around the world. His promise of new life gives hope and 
confidence to His followers. His service and love for His neighbors 
offer a profound lesson for all people.
    During this Easter season, we celebrate God's gifts of freedom and 
justice. We pray for peace and ask for God's blessings on the brave men 
and women who wear our Nation's uniform and their families.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish you a Happy Easter.

                                                          George W. Bush
