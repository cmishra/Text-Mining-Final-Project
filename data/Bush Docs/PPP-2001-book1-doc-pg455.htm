Statement on Senate Action on Legislation To Clean Up Brownfields
April 25, 2001

    I am pleased that the Senate has passed legislation to clean up the 
Nation's brownfields. Environmental reforms must set high standards and 
get results. This legislation will allow communities to reduce 
environmental and health risks, capitalize on existing infrastructure, 
and create jobs. I commend the Senate for their bipartisan approach to 
this important environmental reform.
