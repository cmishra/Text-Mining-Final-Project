White House Statement on the Situation in Guatemala
May 25, 1993

    The President was very disappointed to hear that President Serrano 
of Guatemala has suspended the Congress and courts and other democratic 
rights protected by the Guatemalan Constitution. This illegitimate 
course of action threatens to place Guatemala outside the democratic 
community of nations. We strongly condemn such efforts to resolve 
Guatemala's problems through nondemocratic means. We hope the Guatemalan 
leadership will reverse its course and immediately restore full 
constitutional democracy.
