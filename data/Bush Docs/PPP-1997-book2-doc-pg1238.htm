Statement Urging House of Representatives Action on Campaign Finance 
Reform
September 25, 1997

    I am greatly encouraged by the statements calling for House action 
on campaign finance reform legislation made earlier today by Democratic 
Leader Gephardt, and yesterday by House Majority Leader Armey. I applaud 
these two

House leaders for their commitment to scheduling a House floor debate on 
this critical issue before Congress adjourns for the year.
    This bipartisan call for action is a promising sign that we are 
moving forward in our response to America's demand for reform. I urge 
the Members of the House to take the next step and give their full 
support for the meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform offered by 
Representatives Shays and Meehan. This measure is both balanced and 
effective, and it addresses many of the most pressing needs for reform.
    Congress faces the best opportunity in a generation to enact 
campaign finance reform. Let us work together in a bipartisan spirit to 
enact the Shays-Meehan legislation and answer the public's call for 
reform.
