Statement on Congressional Action on Proposed Foster Care Legislation
November 20, 1999

    Hillary and I are very pleased that the Congress today approved H.R. 
3443, ``Foster Care Independence Act of 1999.'' This legislation helps 
ensure that young people in foster care get the tools they need to make 
the most of their lives. It builds on proposals in my budget to empower 
those leaving foster care by providing them access to health care, 
better educational opportunities, training, housing assistance, 
counseling, and other support and services. We cannot let these young 
people walk their tough road alone.
    Each year approximately 20,000 18-year-olds leave our Nation's 
foster care system without an adoptive family or other permanent family 
relationship. Without the emotional, social, and financial support that 
families provide, many of these young people are not adequately prepared 
for life after foster care. Unfortunately, Federal financial support 
ends just as they are making the critical transition to independence. 
This bill addresses that problem and will help these youth in their 
effort to become successful, independent adults.
    I am also pleased that the Act provides additional funds for the 
adoption incentive payments, which are bonuses to the States for 
increasing the number of children adopted from public foster care. This 
additional funding will enable States to receive the full amount of the 
bonuses they have earned through outstanding performance.
    Today's legislation is a fitting tribute to the late Senator John 
Chafee, who was a chief sponsor of the Act. A fierce champion of 
children, Senator Chafee paid particular attention to our Nation's most 
vulnerable young people. I am pleased that the bill renames the 
Independent Living Program in his honor.
    I would also like to thank the House and Senate leadership, as well 
as Representatives Nancy Johnson<Johnson, Nancy L.> and Ben 
Cardin,<Cardin, Benjamin L.> Chairman William Roth, Jr.,<Roth, 
William V., Jr.> and Senators Jay Rockefeller,<Rockefeller, 
John D., IV> Daniel Patrick Moynihan,<Moynihan, Daniel 
Patrick> Charles Grassley,<Grassley, Charles E.> 
John Breaux,<Breaux, John B.> James Jeffords,<Jeffords, James 
M.> Jack Reed,<Reed, Jack> and Susan 
Collins<Collins, Susan M.> for their hard work and dedication 
to this issue. I look forward to signing this bill into law.
