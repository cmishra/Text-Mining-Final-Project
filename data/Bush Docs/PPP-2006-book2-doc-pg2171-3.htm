Statement on Congressional Passage of Fisheries Management Legislation
December 9, 2006

    I applaud Congress for working in a bipartisan manner to pass a 
stronger Magnuson-Stevens Act. Our Nation is committed to maintaining 
our thriving commercial and
recreational fishing communities. This bill embraces my priorities of 
ending overfishing and rebuilding our Nation's fish stocks through more 
effective, market-

based management and tougher enforcement. This landmark legislation also 
provides stronger tools to achieve progress internationally to ensure 
healthy fish stocks, promote better management, and halt destructive 
fishing practices based on sound science.
    Since my administration released the Ocean Action Plan in 2004, we 
have been making great strides in our efforts to make our oceans, 
coasts, and Great Lakes cleaner, healthier, and more productive. 
Enactment of this bill is one of the top priorities of the Ocean Action 
Plan and is another significant bipartisan environmental achievement.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 5946.
