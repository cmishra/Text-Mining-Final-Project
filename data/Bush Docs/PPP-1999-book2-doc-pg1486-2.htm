Message on the Observance of Labor Day, 1999
September 3, 1999

    Warm greetings to all Americans across our country as we celebrate 
Labor Day.
    For more than a century, we have set aside this day to honor our 
nation's working men and women whose energy, talent, creativity, and 
determination have built the foundations of freedom and prosperity that 
generations of Americans have enjoyed. Through the decades, America's 
workers have built a strong economy and strived to bring justice and 
dignity to the workplace.
    Today all Americans owe a debt of gratitude to our nation's labor 
force. Since 1992, we have experienced the longest peacetime economic 
expansion in American history, with nearly 20 million new jobs, wages 
rising at twice the rate of inflation, the highest percentage of home 
ownership, the shortest welfare rolls, and the lowest peacetime 
unemployment rate since 1957. We have fully restored fiscal soundness to 
the federal budget, with a budget surplus of at least $99 billion--the 
largest dollar surplus in American history.
    With America's robust economy, we have the opportunity--and the 
responsibility--to address the needs of our nation's working families. 
We must take advantage of this unique moment in time to reform Social 
Security and Medicare to preserve them for our children. We must ensure 
that these programs are there for our children in the 21st century just 
as they were there for our parents and grandparents in the 20th century. 
And we must raise the minimum wage to make certain that our workers are 
able to earn a decent income.
    As we observe this last Labor Day of the 20th century, let us 
rededicate ourselves to this important effort. On behalf of a grateful 
nation,

I salute America's working men and women and send best wishes for a 
wonderful holiday.

                                                            Bill Clinton
