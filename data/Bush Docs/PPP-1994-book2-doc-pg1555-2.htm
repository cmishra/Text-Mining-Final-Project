Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
September 8, 1994

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I am 
submitting to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement 
of the Cyprus question. The previous report covered progress through May 
20, 1994. The current report covers the remainder of May through July 
31, 1994.
    During this period both sides in the Cyprus dispute said that they 
accept the U.N. proposed package of confidence-building measures. We 
will be working closely with the United Nations to reconcile the 
remaining differences concerning the modalities of implementation.
    I would also like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest 
gratitude for the efforts of Robert Lamb, who retired as Special Cyprus 
Coordinator on June 1 after 32 years of distinguished service in the 
U.S. Foreign Service. Special Cyprus Coordinator Lamb's dedication and 
commitment to finding a solution to the Cyprus problem was unbending. He 
worked diligently to bring both sides closer together and is responsible 
for the recent significant progress. We are actively searching for a 
replacement for Robert Lamb.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Claiborne Pell, Chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office 
of the Press Secretary on September 15.
