Statement on House of Representatives Action on Jobs-and-Growth Tax 
Relief Legislation
May 9, 2003

    I commend the House for making great progress toward passing a jobs-
and-growth package that will spur economic growth and create jobs for 
American workers. The tax relief package passed by the House today 
includes all of the elements of my original plan, including accelerating 
all income-tax rates, increasing small-business expensing, increasing 
the child credit, delivering significant marriage penalty relief, and 
addressing the unfair double tax on dividends. I look forward to 
building on this success to deliver the economic boost America's workers 
deserve.
