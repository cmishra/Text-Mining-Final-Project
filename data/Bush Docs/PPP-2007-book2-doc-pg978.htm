Statement on the Resignation of R. James Nicholson<Nicholson, R. 
James<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of Veterans Affairs
July 17, 2007

    Jim Nicholson has served his country and his fellow veterans with 
distinction. I appreciate his willingness to serve and his leadership as 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
    For over 2\1/2\ years, Jim has worked to improve the Federal 
Government's ability to care for our Nation's veterans. As our troops 
continue to fight in the global war on terror, Jim has led innovative 
efforts to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs is better 
prepared to address the challenges facing our newest generation of 
heroes after they return home. He has also launched a major information 
technology transformation in the VA that has strengthened the 
Department's ability to protect patient health information. As a 
veteran, as a son of a veteran, and as a father of a veteran, Jim should 
be especially proud of his service to those who have worn America's 
uniform.
    I also appreciate Jim's service as U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See, 
where he championed human dignity and freedom for people throughout the 
world.
    I thank Jim for his friendship and his leadership during this 
historic time. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish Jim and 
Suzanne<Nicholson, Suzanne M.<ls-thn-eq> all the best.
