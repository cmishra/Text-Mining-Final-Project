Letter to Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting a 
Supplemental Appropriation Request
June 30, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider expeditiously the enclosed request in 
the amount of $975 million for a supplemental appropriation for the 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
    I am requesting these resources to cover the increased costs in FY 
2005 that the VA is experiencing in its medical care system.
    As Secretary Nicholson informed the Congress on June 28th, 
additional needs in the VA medical care system have also been identified 
for FY 2006. Details on specific FY 2006 requirements are under review 
and will be transmitted separately. My Administration is committed to 
ensuring that our Nation's veterans continue to receive timely and high-
quality health care.

    The details of the FY 2005 request are set forth in the enclosed 
letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
