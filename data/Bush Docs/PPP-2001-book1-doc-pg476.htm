Statement on the Retirement of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director 
Louis J. Freeh<Freeh, Louis J.<ls-thn-eq>
May 1, 2001

    Louis Freeh is a dedicated public servant who has served his country 
and the FBI with honor and distinction. I regret the Director is leaving 
Government. We are fortunate to have had a man of his caliber serve our 
country, and we will miss him.
