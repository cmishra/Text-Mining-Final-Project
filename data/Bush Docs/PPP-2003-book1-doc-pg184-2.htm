Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
February 19, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with section 620C(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration 
on progress toward a negotiated solution of the Cyprus question covering 
the period December 1, 2002, through January 31, 2003. The previous 
submission covered events from October 1, 2002, through November 30, 
2002.
    My Administration was particularly active during this reporting 
period in supporting U.N. Secretary-General Annan's<Annan, 
Kofi> efforts to foster a comprehensive Cyprus settlement on 
the basis of the plan he has proposed. Although such a settlement did 
not emerge at the European Union's Summit in Copenhagen in December, 
intense diplomatic activity has continued. Secretary Powell,<Powell, 
Colin L.> Under Secretary Marc Grossman,<Grossman, 
Marc> Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas Weston,<Weston, Thomas 
G.> and Ambassador to Cyprus Michael Klosson<Klosson, 
Michael> are encouraging all relevant parties to maintain a 
spirit of compromise and a commitment to reaching an agreement by 
February 28, 2003. I will do the same as part of our continuing 
commitment to the U.N. effort to find a just and lasting settlement for 
Cyprus.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard G. Lugar, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations. This letter was released by the Office 
of the Press Secretary on February 20.
