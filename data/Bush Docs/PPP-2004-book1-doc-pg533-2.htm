Message on the Observance of Passover, 5764
April 5, 2004

    I send greetings to those observing Passover, beginning at sundown 
on April 5.
    Freedom is God's gift to every man and woman. During Passover, 
Jewish people celebrate their historic liberation from slavery. This 
joyous eight-day observance is testimony to the power of good to

the message of God's mercy. By reading the Haggadah, which tells the 
story of the Exodus and explains the traditional Passover Seder, Jewish 
children learn about their proud heritage and the importance of faith,

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a Happy Passover.

                                                          George W. Bush
