District of Columbia
October 18, 1993

    The President announced today that he will nominate Rafael Diaz to 
be an associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. 
The President is empowered by statute to choose DC Superior Court judges 
from a list submitted by a local nominating commission.
    ``Rafael Diaz has proven himself with a decade's service to the 
District of Columbia,'' said the President. ``His solid record and his 
reputation for competence have been widely noted, and he has been 
strongly recommended by a wide range of people. I expect him to be an 
outstanding judge.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
