Statement by the Press Secretary on Reforming Multilateral 
Peace Operations
May 5, 1994

    On May 3, 1994, President Clinton signed a Presidential Decision 
Directive establishing ``U.S. Policy on Reforming Multilateral Peace 
Operations.'' This directive is the product of a year-long interagency 
policy review and extensive consultations with dozens of Members of 
Congress from both parties.
    The policy represents the first, comprehensive framework for U.S. 
decisionmaking on issues of peacekeeping and peace enforcement suited to 
the realities of the post-cold-war period.
    Peace operations are not and cannot be the centerpiece of U.S. 
foreign policy. However, as the policy states, properly conceived and 
well-executed peace operations can be a useful element in serving 
America's interests. The directive prescribes a number of specific steps 
to improve U.S. and U.N. management of U.N. peace operations in order to 
ensure that use of such operations is selective and more effective.
    The administration will release today an unclassified document 
outlining key elements of the Clinton administration's policy on 
reforming multilateral peace operations.
