Statement on Senate Action on Higher Education Reauthorization 
Legislation
July 10, 1998

    The bill passed last night by the Senate will help my effort to 
usher more Americans through the doors of higher education, doors we 
have opened wide since 1993. There are still serious fiscal and policy 
issues that need to be resolved, and I am committed to working with 
Congress to do that. But I am pleased that the Senate bill endorses the 
new low interest rate for student loans that I proposed to save students 
$11 billion; improves teacher recruitment and training provided by our 
colleges; takes important steps in response to my call for colleges to 
help children at high-poverty schools prepare for and attend college; 
expands access to quality distance learning technologies; and creates 
what would be the Government's first performance-based organization, an 
innovation recommended by our reinventing Government effort.
