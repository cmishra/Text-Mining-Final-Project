Statement on the Department of Justice's Report on Crime
June 1, 1997

    Four years ago, my administration made a commitment to take our 
streets back from crime and violence. We have a comprehensive anticrime 
plan, and it is working. More community police, tougher punishments, and 
fewer guns in the hands of criminals are making a difference. Today's 
Justice Department release marks the largest one-year decline in murder, 
aggravated assault, and violent crime in the past 35 years. The 
continued downward trend over the past 4 years is further evidence that 
we are on the right track with increased community policing, tougher 
penalties, and greater juvenile crime prevention efforts.
    Much work remains to be done, however. Juvenile crime and violence 
must be our top law enforcement priority for the next 4 years. My anti-
gang and youth violence strategy declares war on juvenile crime and 
gangs, with new prosecutors and tougher penalties; an extension of the 
Brady bill, so violent teenage criminals will never have the right to 
purchase a handgun; and resources to keep schools open after hours, on 
weekends, and in the summer. While the House-passed juvenile crime 
legislation falls short of the goals outlined in my strategy, I am 
hopeful that the Senate will improve on this measure and pass it without 
delay. We must keep the crime rate coming down, and every child's 
prospect of a bright future going up.

Note: This statement was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on May 30, but it was embargoed for release until 6 p.m. on 
June 1.
