Remarks Prior to a Meeting With the National Energy Policy Development 
Group and an Exchange With Reporters
January 29, 2001

    The President. This is the first in a series of meetings which will 
be chaired by Vice President Cheney<Cheney, Richard B.<ls-thn-eq> on 
discussing our Nation's energy situation--can't think of a better man to 
run it than the Vice President.
    I've also asked, and he<Cheney, Richard B.<ls-thn-eq> has asked, 
that senior members of the Cabinet participate. This is a matter of high 
concern for this administration, because it's a matter of high concern 
for our Nation. It's becoming very clear to the country that demand is 
outstripping supply, that there are more users of electricity and 
natural gas than there is new units being found, and we've got to do 
something about that in the country.
    This administration is concerned about the people who work for a 
living, concerned about people who struggle every day to get ahead. And 
we understand--fully understand--what high energy costs can mean to 
people in America, and we're going to formulate a strategy to deal with 
it. And the Vice President's<Cheney, Richard B.<ls-thn-eq> going to head 
the task force to report back to me, and to the Nation, how best to cope 
with high energy prices and how best to cope with reliance upon foreign 
oil, how best to encourage the development of pipelines and power-
generating capacity in the country so that we can help our fellow 
citizens.
    We have been dealing with this issue, obviously, because of the 
State of California's woes. And I appreciate very much the way you 
handled it, Mr. Secretary.<Abraham, Spencer<ls-thn-eq> The Governor of 
California<Davis, Gray<ls-thn-eq> asked for a 2 week extension of 
mandatory sales of power and natural gas. We've granted that extension 
for 2 weeks. It looks like they're making progress in California, and 
we're pleased, because the situation is going to be best remedied in 
California by Californians.
    We're very aware in this administration that the situation in 
California is beginning to affect neighboring States. Western Governors 
came to see the Vice President,<Cheney, Richard B.<ls-thn-eq> and they 
came to see me, as well. And they're deeply concerned about the 
situation spreading beyond the California borders, and so are we. And so 
the task force that's being assembled will not only deal with the very 
shortrun issues dealing with the West but, obviously, the longer term 
issues that will be confronting our country for a while, unless we're 
willing to act boldly and swiftly, which we will do.
    Thank you for coming.

    Q. [Inaudible]--questions?
    The President. Next time. Give you a chance to really think of some 
good ones. [Laughter] I've got some suggestions--I've got some 
suggestions. First answer--you can think of the question--first answer 
is, Ravens. [Laughter]

Note: The President spoke at 11:35 a.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Secretary of Energy Spencer
