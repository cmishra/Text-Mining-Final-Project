Message on the Observance of Armed Forces Day, 1995
May 19, 1995

    Every year on this day our citizens join in honoring you, the men 
and women who wear our nation's uniform. You risk your very lives to 
defend the liberties we hold dear. Americans everywhere recognize your 
dedication and professionalism, and all of us feel profound respect, 
pride, and appreciation for our Armed Forces.
    As we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Allied victory in 
World War II, everyone on Earth should pause to express heartfelt 
gratitude to those who fought and sacrificed in that awful conflict. We 
do no greater honor to the memory of those lost in World War II than to 
continue their fight against tyranny and oppression everywhere.
    Each of you has stood to carry on that fight in this past year. You 
have been called to serve in lands far from home. You have brought 
freedom and security to our friends and allies and humanitarian aid to 
those in need. In Haiti, you helped restore democracy; in the Persian 
Gulf, you faced down the forces of aggression;

and in central Africa, you delivered lifesaving food, water, and 
medicine. Throughout the year, you maintained the security of our 
country at home and at posts around the world.
    Whether you serve in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine 
Corps, or the Coast Guard, your standards of excellence and your 
selfless service are models for all Americans. I am proud to salute you 
for your many extraordinary accomplishments.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: Armed Forces Day was observed on May 20.
