Statement on the Death of Jim McKay<McKay, Jim<ls-thn-eq>
June 7, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I were saddened to learn of the 
passing of Jim McKay. For a generation of Americans, Jim was more than 
the much-honored host of ``Wide World of Sports'' and ABC's Olympic 
coverage. He was a talented and eloquent newsman and storyteller whose 
special gift was his ability to make the viewers at home genuinely care 
about more than just who won or lost.
    Jim was at his best during what had to be his most difficult 
assignment, hosting with skill and sensitivity ABC's blanket coverage of 
the 1972 Munich Olympics hostage crisis.
    Off camera, he was a compassionate and generous person and devoted 
family man.
    We are also grateful for Jim's service to his country as a naval 
officer aboard a minesweeper during World War II.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with Jim's wife Margaret,<McManus, 
Margaret<ls-thn-eq> his children Sean<McManus, Sean<ls-thn-eq> and 
Mary,<McManus, Mary<ls-thn-eq> and all of his family and friends.
