Statement on the Resignation of John Bridgeland<Bridgeland, 
John<ls-thn-eq> as Assistant to the President and Director of the USA 
Freedom Corps
December 9, 2003

    John Bridgeland has been a valuable advisor to me for nearly 4 
years. He started on the policy staff of my Presidential campaign in 
early 2000. Since January 20, 2001, he has faithfully served in my 
administration, first as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic 
Policy and Director of the Domestic Policy Council and then as Assistant 
to the President and the first Director of the USA Freedom Corps Office. 
He has worked tirelessly to strengthen a culture of service in America 
and to ensure that we all love our neighbors as we want to be loved 
ourselves. His work has had a positive and vitally important impact on 
government, nonprofit and community service organizations, businesses, 
and many men, women, and children who need a helping hand. I appreciate 
and thank John for his friendship and wise counsel. This good man has 
touched many people through his dedicated public service, and I wish 
him, Maureen,<Bridgeland, Maureen<ls-thn-eq> and their three children 
all the best.
