Statement on the Assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran 
Djindjic<Djindjic, Zoran> 
March 12, 2003

    On behalf of the United States, I extend my condolences to the 
people of Serbia and to the family of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran 
Djindjic, who was shot and killed this morning.
    History will remember Prime Minister Djindjic for his strong 
leadership during Serbia's successful struggle to end the dictatorship 
of Slobodan Milosevic.<Milosevic, Slobodan> Following the 
peaceful transition to a new, democratic Government, Djindjic acted with

and courage to transfer Milosevic to The Hague, where today he stands on 
trial for war crimes. At the helm of the new Government, Prime Minister 
Djindjic was committed to building a prosperous, democratic future for 
Serbia, and he fought to hasten that future's arrival by fighting 
organized crime and reforming Serbia's economy and political 
institutions.
    The United States will continue to support Serbia's pursuit of 
reforms that will open the way to a brighter future and full integration 
with Europe.
