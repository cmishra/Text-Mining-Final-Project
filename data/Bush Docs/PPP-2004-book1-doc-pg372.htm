Terrorist Attacks in Madrid, Spain

    Mr. Ambassador,<Ruperez Rubio, Francisco Javier<ls-thn-eq> thank you 
for having Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and me here during this solemn 
occasion. The United States of America sends our prayers and sympathies 
to the Spanish people, who mourn the loss of life, who today weep for 
their loved ones, who wonder about their future now that there's been 
such tragedy.
    The bombings in Spain are a grim reminder that there are evil people 
in the

world who are willing to kill innocent life. I appreciate so very much 
your Government's strong stand against terrorism and terrorist 
organizations like ETA. The United States of America stands firmly with 
you as we work to make the world more peaceful and more free.
    Killers try to shake our will. They try to shake our confidence in 
the future. Spanish people will stand firm against this type of killing, 
and they'll have a friend with the American people. So Mr. 
Ambassador,<Ruperez Rubio, Francisco Javier<ls-thn-eq> we ask for God's 
blessings for the people of your great country.
    Thank you very much for having Laura and me here.

Note: The President spoke at 1:08 p.m. at the Embassy of Spain in 
Washington, DC. In his remarks, he referred to Francisco Javier Ruperez 
Rubio, Spain's Ambassador to the U.S.; and Basque Fatherland and Liberty 
(ETA).
