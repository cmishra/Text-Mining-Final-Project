Statement on the United Nations General Assembly Vote To Ban Human 
Cloning
March 8, 2005

    I applaud the strong vote of the United Nations General Assembly 
today urging countries to ban all forms of human cloning. I am also 
grateful for the strong statement against practices that exploit women.
    Human life must not be created for the purpose of destroying it. The 
United States and the international community have now spoken clearly 
that human cloning is an affront to human dignity and that we must work 
together to protect human life. I look forward to working with Members 
of Congress to enact legislation to ban all human cloning in the United 
States.
