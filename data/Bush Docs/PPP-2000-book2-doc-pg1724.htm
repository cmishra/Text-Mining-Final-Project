Statement on the University of Arkansas Shooting
August 28, 2000

    Hillary and I were shocked and heartbroken to learn of the tragic 
shooting earlier today at the University of Arkansas on the first day of 
fall classes. While our understanding of the facts in this case is still 
developing, we know that two more lives were taken on a day that should 
have been filled with hope and promise for students and faculty. Federal 
law enforcement officials are assisting local authorities with the 
investigation.
    Today's shooting strikes a particularly sad chord for Hillary and 
me, who both had the privilege of teaching at this wonderful 
institution. We send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers along with those 
of the American public to the families, the university, and the entire 
Fayetteville community as they work through this difficult time.
