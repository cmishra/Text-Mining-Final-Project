Statement on House of Representatives Action To Reauthorize the Ryan 
White CARE Act
September 19, 1995

    I congratulate the Members of the House of Representatives on their 
overwhelming vote to approve a 5-year reauthorization of the Ryan White 
CARE Act. This legislation will assure that Americans who are living 
with HIV and AIDS will continue to receive the life-sustaining services 
that they need. The Ryan White CARE Act is a lifeline to thousands of 
Americans who otherwise have nowhere to turn. I hope the House and 
Senate can quickly work out their differences on this legislation and 
send me a final bill as soon as possible.
