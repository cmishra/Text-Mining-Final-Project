Statement on the Death of Carroll Campbell<Campbell, Carroll A., 
Jr.<ls-thn-eq>
December 7, 2005

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the loss 
of Governor Carroll Campbell. Carroll Campbell was a strong leader, a 
committed public servant, and a good friend. For more than two decades, 
he represented the people of South Carolina as a State legislator, 
Member of Congress, and Governor. He was a tireless advocate for the 
State he loved and was known for his integrity and character. We join 
South Carolinians and Americans around the Nation in mourning the 
passing of Carroll Campbell, and we send our thoughts and prayers to 
Iris<Campbell, Iris Rhodes<ls-thn-eq> and the entire Campbell family.
