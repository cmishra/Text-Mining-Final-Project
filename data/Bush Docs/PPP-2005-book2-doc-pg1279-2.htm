Statement on House of Representatives Passage of Small Business Health 
Insurance Legislation
July 26, 2005

    I applaud the House of Representatives for passing the ``Small 
Business Health Fairness Act,'' which will increase the availability of 
Association Health Plans. AHPs are a fair, innovative, and commonsense 
approach to make health insurance more affordable and accessible, one of 
my top domestic priorities. By letting small businesses join together to 
buy insurance at the same discounts big companies get, this bill will 
help workers and their families have more health care choices and obtain 
greater savings. This change is overdue, and I urge the Senate to follow 
the House's lead and pass this good legislation this year.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 525.
