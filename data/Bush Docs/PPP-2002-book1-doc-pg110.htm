Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Iraq's 
Compliance With United Nations Security Council Resolutions
January 23, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) and as part of my effort to keep the 
Congress fully informed, I am providing a report prepared by my 
Administration on the status of efforts to obtain Iraq's compliance with 
the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Security Council. The last 
report, consistent with Public Law 102-1, was transmitted on October 11, 
2001.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Robert C. Byrd, President pro tempore of 
the Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on January 24.
