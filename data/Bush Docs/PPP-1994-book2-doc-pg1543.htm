Statement on Senate Action on Banking Legislation
September 13, 1994

    Today this country took an historic step, one that has been delayed 
for much too long, to help American banks better meet the needs of our 
people, our communities, and our economy. By joining the House in 
passing the interstate banking bill, the Senate has gone beyond gridlock 
to eliminate unnecessary barriers to the competitiveness and efficiency 
of our banking system while preserving essential prerogatives of the 
States.
    We also welcome the bill's requirement that the Treasury, with the 
assistance of a broadly representative advisory committee, study and 
make recommendations on the future shape of financial services in the 
United States. American banks have shown over the last several years 
that they can combine high quality service for all with strong financial 
performance. Enactment of the interstate bill and the community 
development and regulatory improvement legislation will help them 
continue that record.
