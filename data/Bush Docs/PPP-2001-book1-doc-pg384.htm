Remarks on Plans for Release of United States Navy Aircraft Crewmembers 
in China
April 11, 2001

    Good morning. I'm pleased to be able to tell the American people 
that plans are underway to bring home our 24 American service men and 
women from Hainan Island.
    This morning the Chinese Government assured our American 
Ambassador<Prueher, Joseph W.<ls-thn-eq> that the crew would leave 
promptly. We're working on arrangements to pick them up and to bring 
them home.
    This has been a difficult situation for both our countries. I know 
the American people join me in expressing sorrow for the loss of life of 
a Chinese pilot. Our prayers are with his wife and his child.
    I appreciate the hard work of our Ambassador to China, Joseph 
Prueher,<Prueher, Joseph W.<ls-thn-eq> and his entire Embassy team, who 
worked tirelessly to solve this situation. The American people, their 
families, and I are proud of our crew, and we look forward to welcoming 
them home.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:25 a.m. in the James S. Brady Briefing 
Room at the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Ruan Guoqin, 
widow of Chinese pilot Wang Wei, and their son, Wang Ding.
