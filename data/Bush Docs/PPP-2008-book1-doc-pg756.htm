Statement on Senate Confirmation of Steven C. Preston<Preston, Steven 
C.<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development
June 5, 2008

    I am pleased that the Senate unanimously confirmed Steve Preston to 
serve as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    Steve is a strong leader whose understanding of our financial 
markets and strong management skills make him highly qualified to serve 
in this important position. He

will aggressively work to ensure that the Department remains focused on 
its mission of making housing more affordable and helping Americans keep 
their homes. Steve is also a consensus builder who will build on our 
efforts to work with Congress on responsible legislation addressing our 
Nation's housing policies.
