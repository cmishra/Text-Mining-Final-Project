Statement on the Congo Conflict Cease-Fire Agreement
September 1, 1999

    I welcome the signing of a cease-fire agreement by founding members 
of the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) yesterday in Lusaka. Their 
signature brings into force the Lusaka accord, signed by six African 
heads of state on July 10th and aimed at ending the war in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. In a region that has seen terrible 
violence, there is now a chance for a genuine and just peace. I urge all 
parties to implement and adhere to the agreement and to act in good 
faith to enable the citizens of the Congo and neighboring states to 
pursue their lives in peace, prosperity, and democracy.
    I especially congratulate the leaders of the Southern African 
Development Community

(SADC), Rwanda, and Uganda for working together to secure RCD signature 
of the Lusaka accord. This agreement is the result of the vision, 
dedication, and courage of regional nations and their leaders. It is a 
crucial step in ending one of the continent's most dangerous wars. The 
same courage and commitment are now required to see the accord fully 
implemented.
    The continuing effort to build an enduring peace deserves America's 
support. We will work closely with all parties to realize the goals of 
the Lusaka accord: to achieve a broadbased, democratic, and open 
political process in the Congo and to address the security concerns of 
neighboring states. I hope the agreement will help end the cycle of 
violence in the region and promote stability and reconstruction across 
central Africa.
