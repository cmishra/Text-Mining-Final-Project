Remarks at a State Dinner Hosted by President Gloria Macapagal-
Arroyo<Macapagal-Arroyo, Gloria<ls-thn-eq> in Manila
October 18, 2003

    The President. Thank you very much, Madam President and Attorney 
Arroyo,<Arroyo, Jose Miguel<ls-thn-eq> for your gracious hospitality. 
Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are really grateful for your warm 
words of welcome. We also appreciate the distinction you have bestowed 
upon us this evening, the Order of the Sikatuna and the Order of 
Gabriela Silang. We are honored to accept them on behalf of the American 
people.
    I represent the oldest democracy in the Americas. And I'm proud to 
pay tribute to the oldest democracy in Asia. The friendship between our 
countries is strong and warm and enduring, and we reaffirm that 
partnership here tonight.
    Today I was the first United States President since Dwight 
Eisenhower to address a Joint Session of your Congress. In 1960, 
President Eisenhower expressed America's firm support for a fledgling 
democracy. Two generations later, I am pleased to show my country's 
support for the great democracy you have become.
    The Philippines and the United States are linked by shared values, 
by shared history, and by a shared commitment to the defense of liberty. 
Only a few miles from this palace are the graves of 17,000 Americans who 
fought for freedom in the Pacific. Their lasting legacy and the legacy 
of the Filipinos who fought with them is a free and democratic 
Philippine nation.
    Today, free nations are tested once again. Once again, we face 
determined enemies of freedom, the terrorists and their allies. Once 
again, we are depending on one another in an hour of need. Once again, 
we are relying on the strength of the great alliance between our two 
countries. Once again, we will prevail.
    Madam President, I thank you for your friendship and counsel, for 
your courage and perseverance. And I offer this toast to you, to the 
great nation of the Philippines, and to the lasting friendship between 
our two peoples.

 [At this point, the President offered a toast.]

    The President. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 6:45 p.m. at Malacanang Palace. In his 
remarks, he referred to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the 
Philippines, and her husband, Jose Miguel Arroyo.
