Message on the Observance of Juneteenth
June 19, 2002

    I send greetings to those celebrating Juneteenth.
    June 19 provides an opportunity for all Americans to reflect on the 
ideal of freedom and to learn more about the end of slavery. On that day 
in 1865, Union soldiers led by Major General Gordon Granger landed in 
Galveston, Texas, with news the war had ended and that the enslaved were 
now free. The joyous, but belated, announcement came two years after 
President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation declaring 
``that all persons held as slaves'' within the rebellious states ``are, 
and henceforward shall be free.''
    The celebration of Juneteenth has its roots in Texas, but the 
holiday is now observed in many parts of the country with picnics, 
family gatherings, parades, and community programs. The day is a fitting 
time to celebrate freedom from slavery and for all Americans to reflect 
on the rich contributions of African Americans to our Nation.
    As we celebrate Juneteenth on June 19, I encourage all Americans to 
reaffirm their commitment to achieving equal justice and opportunity for 
all citizens. Laura joins me in sending best wishes on this special 
occasion.
