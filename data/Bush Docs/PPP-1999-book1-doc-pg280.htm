Statement on Emergency Assistance for Farmers and Ranchers
February 26, 1999

    Today I am sending to the Congress requests for a $152 million 
emergency supplemental appropriation to help America's farmers and 
ranchers. Many farm communities continue to undergo very hard times 
despite the disaster aid we worked so hard to provide last year. 
Economic turmoil in Pacific Rim countries and around the world continue 
to make it difficult for American farmers and ranchers to export their 
goods overseas. More and more farmers and ranchers need loans to see 
them through to better times, and our Department of Agriculture simply 
is running out of available credit.
    The Agriculture Department's staff around the country needs 
immediate help to handle the increased workload brought on by providing 
emergency services. I hope that Congress will join me in helping our 
farmers and ranchers during this difficult time, particularly when the 
rest of the country is blessed with unparalleled prosperity. I urge them 
to approve this request by the end of March.
