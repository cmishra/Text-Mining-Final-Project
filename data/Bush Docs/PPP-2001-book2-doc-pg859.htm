Statement on the Death of Katharine Graham<Graham, Katharine>
July 17, 2001

    The Nation's Capital and our entire Nation today mourn the loss of 
the beloved first lady of Washington and American journalism, Katharine 
Graham. Her legacy and influence spanned many different arenas, from 
powerful publisher to quiet philanthropist, to accomplished 
businesswoman, to Pulitzer Prize winning author, to gracious and loyal 
friend. Presidents come and go, and Katharine Graham knew them all. When 
Laura and I moved to Washington, she was the first to welcome a new 
President to the Nation's Capital with a dinner at her home. Mrs. Graham 
became a legend in her own lifetime because she was a true leader and a 
true lady, steely yet shy, powerful yet humble, known for her integrity 
and always gracious and generous to others. Her life, chronicled in her 
Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography, presents a tremendous example for 
our generation and generations to come. Laura and I send our prayers to 
her children and grandchildren, to her colleagues at the Washington Post 
Co., and to her many friends throughout Washington, America, and the 
world. She will be sorely missed.
