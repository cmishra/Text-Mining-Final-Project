To the Congress of the United States:
    Consistent with the authorities relating to official immunity in the 
interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking (Public Law 
107-108, 22 U.S.C. 2291-4), and in order to keep the Congress fully 
informed, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration. This 
report includes matters relating to the interdiction of aircraft engaged 
in illicit drug trafficking.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,
