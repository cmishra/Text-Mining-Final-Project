Nomination for Posts at the Department of Defense
November 23, 1993

    The President announced today that he has nominated Richard F. 
Keevey to be the Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Defense 
and Stephen M. Ryan to be the Department's Inspector General.
    ``We must ensure that our Nation's defense dollars are spent 
frugally, and that the vast operations of the Pentagon are managed in 
the most efficient manner possible,'' said the President. ``Under 
Secretary Aspin's leadership, great strides have been taken towards 
eliminating waste and fraud, and ensuring the most cost-effective 
procurement and management processes possible. With a seasoned manager 
like Richard Keevey and an experienced investigator like Stephen Ryan on 
board, those efforts will progress even further.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
