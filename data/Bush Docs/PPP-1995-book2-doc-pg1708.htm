Statement on Congressional Action on Proposed Environmental Legislation
November 2, 1995

    Today's vote on the 17 special interest environmental riders is a 
step in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go if we 
are to stop Congress' assault on public health and the environment.
    Even with the elimination of the riders, the Republican budget still 
dismantles vital protections that keep our Nation healthy, safe, and 
secure. It still cuts funding for enforcement of environmental laws in 
half. America cannot protect the environment if we gut enforcement of 
antipollution laws.
    As important as today's vote was, Congress' responsibility does not 
end here. Now, congressional Republicans must take the next steps and 
change their bill to fully protect public health and the environment. As 
we balance the budget in the interest of our children, we must not leave 
them a world that is more polluted and less livable.
