Nomination for Secretary of the Navy
April 21, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate John 
Dalton, an Annapolis graduate and former Chairman of the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board, to be Secretary of the Navy.
    ``Throughout his distinguished Navy career and his equally 
distinguished civilian career in public service and private industry, 
John Dalton has displayed true leadership ability,'' said the President. 
``I am proud that he has agreed to serve with me and confident that he 
will work with Secretary Aspin and the Navy to adjust to the new 
security realities that we face.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
