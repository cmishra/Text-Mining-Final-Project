Statement on the Death of Walter M. Schirra, Jr.<Schirra, Walter M. 
``Wally,'' Jr.<ls-thn-eq>
May 3, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by the death of 
Wally Schirra. Wally was a member of the original seven, our Nation's 
first class of astronauts. ``Jolly Wally,'' as he was affectionately 
known, was the fifth American to go into space, and holds the 
distinction as the only astronaut to fly in each of NASA's pioneering 
space flight programs: Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. His ventures into 
space furthered our understanding of manned space flight and helped pave 
the way for mankind's first journey to the Moon. Laura and I join 
Wally's family and

friends and the NASA community in mourning the loss of an American hero.
