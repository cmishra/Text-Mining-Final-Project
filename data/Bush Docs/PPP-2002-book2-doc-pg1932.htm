Statement on Signing the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area Study Act
October 30, 2002

    I have signed into law S. 1227, the Niagara Falls National Heritage 
Area Study Act. The Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to study 
the suitability and feasibility of establishing the Niagara Falls 
National Heritage Area in the State of New York, along and in the 
vicinity of the Niagara River.
    Section 3(d) purports to require the Secretary of the Interior to 
submit to the Congress recommendations related to legislation. The 
executive branch shall construe this provision in a manner consistent 
with the President's constitutional authority to submit for 
consideration to the Congress legislative proposals as the President 
judges are necessary and expedient.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 October 30, 2002.

Note: S. 1227, approved October 30, was assigned Public Law No. 107-256.
