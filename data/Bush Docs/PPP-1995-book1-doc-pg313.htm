Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the
National Endowment for Democracy
March 6, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    Pursuant to the provisions of section 504(h) of Public Law 98-164, 
as amended (22 U.S.C. 4413(i)), I transmit herewith the 11th Annual 
Report of the National Endowment for Democracy, which covers fiscal year 
1994.
    Promoting democracy abroad is one of the central pillars of the 
United States' security strategy. The National Endowment for Democracy 
has proved to be a unique and remarkable instrument for spreading and 
strengthening the rule of democracy. By continuing our support, we will 
advance America's interests in the world.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

March 6, 1995.
