Statement on the Attorney General's<Reno, Janet> Decision To 
Conclude the Investigation of Harold Ickes<Ickes, Harold>
January 29, 1999

    I have always had confidence that Harold Ickes acted lawfully and 
appropriately, and I am pleased by the decision announced by the 
Attorney General today. Harold's contributions to this administration 
over the years have helped improve the quality of life in this country, 
and I will always be thankful for his advice and hard work on behalf of 
the American people.

Note. On January 29, Attorney General Janet Reno notified the Special 
Division of the Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, that there were no 
reasonable grounds for further investigation into whether Mr. Ickes 
knowingly and willfully testified falsely before Congress in September 
1997.
