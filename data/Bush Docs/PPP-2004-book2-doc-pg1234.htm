Letter to Congressional Leaders Submitting Proposed Legislative Changes 
To Implement the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement
July 2, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    On May 18, 2004, the United States Trade Representative signed the 
United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement on behalf of the United 
States. Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 2002, 
I am submitting a description of the changes to existing laws, prepared 
by my Administration, that would be required to bring the United States 
into compliance with that agreement.
    I look forward to working with the Congress in developing 
legislation to implement this free trade agreement with an important 
economic partner and close ally.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate.
