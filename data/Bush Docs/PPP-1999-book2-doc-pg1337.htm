Statement on the Death of Dan Dutko<Dutko, Dan>
July 27, 1999

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened by the untimely death of our good 
friend Dan Dutko. Dan has been a friend, an ally, and an adviser for 
nearly three decades. He enriched our lives with his enthusiasm and 
served his country with distinction. He deeply believed in the cause of 
the Democratic Party and worked tirelessly to ensure that it would have 
the ability to communicate effectively with the voters. He was a devoted 
supporter of Israel and a champion of national service.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Deborah,<Jospin, 
Deborah> and their two young children, Matthew<Dutko, 
Matthew> and Jonathan.<Dutko, Jonathan>
