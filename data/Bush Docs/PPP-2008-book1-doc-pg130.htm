Subject: Review of Recommendations From the Public Interest

    The Public Interest Declassification Board, an advisory group

amended (50 U.S.C. 435 note), has submitted a report entitled 
``Improving Declassification.'' The report addresses 15 issues and makes 
49 recommendations relating to declassification of classified national 
security information.
    Please submit in writing no later than April 15, 2008, through the 
Assistants to the President for National Security Affairs and for 
Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, your views on each of the 
recommendations, including with respect to each recommendation your view 
of whether and to what extent it should be implemented. Your views with 
respect to the recommendations should take into account the public 
interest in declassification of national security information, effective 
records management, and the effective conduct of United States 
diplomatic, economic, military, energy, homeland security, and 
intelligence activities, as well as such other matters as you deem 
appropriate for consideration.

                                                          George W. Bush
