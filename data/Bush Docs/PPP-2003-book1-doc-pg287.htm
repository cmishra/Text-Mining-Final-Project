Statement on House of Representatives Action on the Budget Resolution
March 21, 2003

    As we engage in action to ensure freedom and security, it is 
imperative that we stay focused on important domestic priorities, 
including creating jobs and strengthening economic growth at home. With 
passage of the budget resolution, the House has spoken clearly that 
future economic growth and job creation requires passing the bold plan 
that I proposed. I commend the House for its timely action and look 
forward to working with Congress to ensure that we fund our priorities, 
enact policies to spur growth, and restrain spending.
