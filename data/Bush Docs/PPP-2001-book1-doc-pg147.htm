Memorandum on Racial Profiling
February 27, 2001

Memorandum for the Attorney General

Subject: Racial Profiling

    I hereby direct you to review the use by Federal law enforcement 
authorities of race as a factor in conducting stops, searches, and other 
investigative procedures. In particular, I ask that you work with the 
Congress to develop methods or mechanisms to collect any relevant data 
from Federal law enforcement agencies and work in cooperation with State 
and local law enforcement in order to assess the extent and nature of 
any such practices.
    I further direct that you report back to me with your findings and 
recommendations for the improvement of the just and equal administration 
of our Nation's laws.

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on February 28.
