Message on the Observance of Labor Day
September 1, 2006

    I send greetings to those celebrating Labor Day 2006.
    America is the most innovative Nation in the world because our free 
enterprise system unleashes the talent and creativity of our people. 
American workers are vital to our Nation's economic prosperity, and they 
help us confront the competitive challenges of the global marketplace.
    My Administration remains committed to fostering an environment 
where innovation succeeds and opportunity thrives. Since August 2003, 
our economy has created more than 5.7 million jobs, and manufacturing 
production has risen 5.6 percent in the last year. Our economic 
expansion is lifting the lives of millions of our citizens, and we will 
continue to work toward developing sound economic polices that keep our 
economy moving forward and create more jobs for American workers.
    Each year on Labor Day, we recognize the dedicated men and women of 
our Nation's workforce. By working hard each day, these highly-skilled 
individuals build better lives for themselves and their families and 
make America stronger.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes on this 
special occasion.

                                                          George W. Bush
