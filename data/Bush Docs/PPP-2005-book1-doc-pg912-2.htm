H.<ls-thn-eq> as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission

    Bill Donaldson took on a tough job at a tough time, and he delivered 
for the American people. He vigorously and fairly enforced our Nation's 
securities laws and helped rebuild the public trust in corporate America 
that has been important to our economic recovery. I am grateful for his 
dedicated service, and Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish him and 
Jane<Donaldson, Jane Phillips<ls-thn-eq> all the best.
