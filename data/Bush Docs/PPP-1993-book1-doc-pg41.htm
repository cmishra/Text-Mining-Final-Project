Exchange With Reporters Prior to Meeting With Democratic Congressional 
Leaders
February 3, 1993

    Q. Mr. President, when do you want campaign's finance reforms to go 
into effect?
    The President. We're here to talk about what's going to be in the 
bill. I want to pass a bill early this year, as early as we can, and 
we're going to talk about that.
    There was a good bill last year--it had a lot of good features in 
it--which was vetoed by President Bush. And I guess we'll start talking 
about that and see where we go from there. But I hope we can get a good 
bill.
    In terms of when it goes into effect, and the last bill skipped an 
election cycle and was widely applauded by all the public interest 
groups as a great advance over where we are now. I think when it goes 
into effect is a subject of discussion here. But I want to pass a good 
bill. That's my concern.

Note: The President spoke at 3:49 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
