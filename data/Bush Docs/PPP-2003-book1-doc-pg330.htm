Statement on Senate Action on Faith-Based Initiative Legislation
April 9, 2003

    I commend the Senate for acting in a bipartisan way to pass 
legislation that will help us meet our shared goal of better serving 
Americans in need. This legislation contains key elements of the Faith-
Based Initiative that I proposed more than 2 years ago to encourage more 
charitable giving and rally the armies of compassion that exist in 
communities all across America.
    America's charities face tough times, and we can do more to support 
their efforts. I look forward to continuing to work with Congress to 
improve the CARE Act legislation, and I continue to urge Congress to 
take additional steps to end discrimination against faith-based 
organizations that have a proven record of helping people in need 
realize a better life.
