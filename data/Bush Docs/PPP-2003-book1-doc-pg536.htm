Statement on Congressional Action on Jobs-and-Growth Tax Relief 
Legislation
May 23, 2003

    I commend the House and Senate for acting in a bipartisan fashion to 
bring tax relief to American families, small businesses, and 
entrepreneurs. In passing this jobs-and-growth plan, Congress has taken 
a major step forward in the effort to boost economic growth and create 
jobs. One hundred thirty-six million taxpayers, including 12 million 
seniors and 23 million small-business owners, will directly benefit from 
this plan. A married couple with two children and household income of 
$40,000 will see their taxes cut by 96 percent this year. A growing 
economy is an urgent priority for all Americans, and I look forward to 
signing this bill and to seeing that tax relief is felt in paychecks 
quickly.
