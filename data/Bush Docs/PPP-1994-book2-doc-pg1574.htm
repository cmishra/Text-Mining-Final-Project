Remarks Prior to a Breakfast With President Jimmy Carter,
General Colin Powell, and Senator Sam Nunn
September 19, 1994

    Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Let me--before we sit for 
breakfast, let me just make a couple of points very briefly. First of 
all, our deepest thanks as a nation should go to President Carter, 
General Powell, and Senator Nunn. They have had about 4 hours' sleep in 
the last 2 or 3 nights. They have worked very hard, and they have, I 
think, made a major contribution toward helping us find a peaceful 
solution to the problem in Haiti.
    I also want to say to you, I think that a significant measure of 
credit goes to the United States military forces for their preparation, 
their readiness, and their eminence. And finally, let me say that we 
have, this morning, the first peaceful introduction of our forces there 
to begin to carry out the mandate of the United Nations.
    So it has been, so far, a good day, thanks in no small measure to 
the extraordinary labors of this delegation. I know that you join me in 
thanking them for all they've done.
    We're going to have a press conference in just a minute, so there's 
no point in having two. [Laughter]
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:21 a.m. in the State Dining Room at the 
White House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
these remarks.
