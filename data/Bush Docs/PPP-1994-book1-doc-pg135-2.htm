Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Bulgaria
January 26, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:
    On June 3, 1993, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Bulgaria is in full compliance with the freedom of emigration criteria 
of sections 402 and 409 of the Trade Act of 1974. This determination 
allowed for the continuation of most-favored nation (MFN) status and 
certain U.S. Government financial programs

for Bulgaria without the requirement of a waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated Report to Congress 
concerning emigration laws and policies of the Republic of Bulgaria. You 
will find that the report indicates continued Bulgarian compliance with 
U.S. and international standards in the areas of emigration and human 
rights policy.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

January 26, 1994.
