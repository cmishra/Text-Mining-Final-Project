Statement on Action To Defend Minority Voting Opportunities 
February 22, 1994

    I have been advised that the Department of Justice has announced 
that the United States will participate in voting rights litigation in 
three States to defend minority voting opportunities. The legal action 
taken today in cases in North Carolina, Georgia, and Texas reaffirms my 
administration's strong commitment to defend the historic gains made 
under the Voting Rights Act.
    The Voting Rights Act ensures that all Americans may fully 
participate in the democratic process. In recent years, our Nation has 
enjoyed a tremendous increase in minority voter access to our electoral 
system. These hard-won victories must not be abandoned. I applaud the 
forceful actions of Attorney General Reno and the Justice Department to 
ensure that voting rights are vigorously protected.
