    I want to invite all Americans to join Hillary and me for 
``America's Millennium,'' a spectacular 3-day celebration in our 
Nation's Capital to ring in a new year, new century, new millennium. 
Join us in honoring our past and imagining the future, by kicking off 
the celebration at 11 a.m. on December 31st with an opening ceremony at 
the Main Street Millennium stage at 12th and Constitution. Enjoy free 
performances and programs at many of the Smithsonian museums, and food 
and fun at the city's block party.
    Usher in the year 2000 at America's Millennium Gala at the Lincoln 
Memorial, beginning at 9 p.m. It will include a stirring concert, a 
premiere of a film on the 20th century by Steven Spielberg,<Spielberg, 
Steven> and a spectacular finale of lights and fireworks. All 
events are free and open to the public. For more information, call 1-

    From my family to yours, happy new year and a happy new millennium.

Roosevelt Room for later broadcast, and the transcript was released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary on December 21. A tape was not
