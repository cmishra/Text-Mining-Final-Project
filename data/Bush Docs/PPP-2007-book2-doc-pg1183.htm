Remarks at a Luncheon With Southeast Asian Leaders in Sydney
September 7, 2007

    President Bush. Mr. Prime Minister,<Lee Hsien Loong<ls-thn-eq> thank 
you very much for inviting me to join the ASEAN group. ASEAN represents 
our fourth largest trading partner. In other words, this is a group of 
friends that represent more than just social acquaintances; you 
represent commerce and trade and prosperity. And I want to thank you 
very much for giving me the chance to come and talk to you about our 
common interests and common goals.
    I have invited the ASEAN leaders to Texas at their convenience. I'm 
looking forward to hosting you down there. I'm looking forward to 
continuing our constructive conversation on--whether it be democracy or 
fighting terror or expanding trade or avian flu or climate change.
    I also am pleased to announce that we'll be naming an Ambassador to 
ASEAN, so that we can make sure that the ties we've established over the 
past years remain firmly entrenched.
    So I appreciate your hospitality. It's good to be amongst friends. I 
enjoyed our candid conversation, and I thank you for your leadership in 
this important part of the world.
    Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore. Thank you. Thank you 
very much.
    President Bush. You bet. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 1:49 p.m. at the InterContinental Sydney.
