Statement on Legislation To Reauthorize the Voting Rights Act
July 20, 2006

    Last week, the House of Representatives passed legislation to 
reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. This morning, in celebration of the 
heroism of the civil rights movement, I spoke to members of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People at their 97th annual 
convention, here in Washington, DC. At the NAACP convention, I said that 
I looked forward to the Senate promptly passing the House bill without 
amendment. Today the Senate acted and voted to reauthorize this historic 
legislation.
    The Voting Rights Act is one of the most important pieces of 
legislation in our Nation's history. It has been vital to guaranteeing 
the right to vote for generations of Americans and has helped millions 
of our citizens enjoy the full promise of freedom.
    I will be pleased to sign the Voting Rights Act into law, and I will 
continue to work with Congress to ensure that our country lives up to 
our guiding principle that all men and women are created equal.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 9.
