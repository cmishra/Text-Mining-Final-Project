Remarks on Induction Into the Little League Hall of Excellence in South 
Williamsport, Pennsylvania
August 26, 2001

    Steve,<Keener, Stephen D.> thank you very much. You know, 
years ago, when I was playing on those dusty Little League fields in 
west Texas, I never dreamt I would be President of the United States. 
And I can assure you I never dreamt I would be admitted into the Little 
League Hall of Excellence. It's a high honor to be here. It's a high 
honor for Laura and me to be here. I want to thank you so very much for 
your hospitality.
    One of the things I did dream about, though, was making it to 
Williamsport, Pennsylvania, for the Little League World Series. And to 
all the teams that got here, I want to offer my heartiest 
congratulations. I particularly want to welcome the Japanese team and 
wish you all the best. Welcome to America.
    I must confess, I have a soft spot in my heart for the Florida team. 
I know and like your Governor.<Bush, Jeb> [Laughter]
    But to all the teams that were here, congratulations.

    A couple of words I want to say: First, I want to say thanks to all 
the moms and dads who participate in Little League all around the world. 
Little League is a family sport. I can remember my mother sitting behind 
the--behind the backstop in Midland, Texas, telling me what to do. 
[Laughter] She's still telling me what to do. And my advice to all the 
players is, listen to your mother. [Laughter]
    But for all the moms and dads who take special time out of their 
lives to make sure their kids are able to play the great sport of 
baseball, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. You prioritize your 
family, and that's crucial for a healthy world, to make sure our 
families remain strong. I equate Little League Baseball with good 
families.
    I want to thank all the coaches for working with the kids. You're 
not only teaching the kids how to throw and hit; you're teaching them 
incredibly important values, the values of good, clean competition, the 
values of teamwork, the values of working with somebody to win for 
something greater than yourself.
    It's an honor to receive this award from such a fabulous 
organization as Little League Baseball and, on behalf of the Presidency, 
thank you for what you do.
    May God bless the teams who play here, may God bless the families 
represented here, and may God bless the great United States of America.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 5:35 p.m. at Howard J. Lamade Stadium. In 
his remarks, he referred to Stephen D. Keener, president and chief 
executive officer, Little League Baseball, Inc.; and Gov. Jeb Bush of 
Florida.
