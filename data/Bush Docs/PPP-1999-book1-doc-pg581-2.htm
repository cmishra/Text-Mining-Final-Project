Statement on the Deaths of David<McCall, David> and Penny 
McCall<McCall, Penny>
April 19, 1999

    Hillary and I are saddened to learn of the deaths of David and Penny 
McCall, two Americans who dedicated their lives to helping people in 
need around the world. They were killed in an auto accident, along with 
a French colleague, Yvette Pierpaoli,<Pierpaoli, Yvette> and 
their Albanian driver, while engaged in their life's work.
    They were in Albania on a mission for Refugees International to 
explore the possibilities of setting up a region-wide radio network to 
help Kosovar-Albanian refugees locate lost family members.
    By reaching out to help the Kosovar refugees and war-affected people 
throughout the world, they stood for the best of the American spirit. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with their loved ones.
