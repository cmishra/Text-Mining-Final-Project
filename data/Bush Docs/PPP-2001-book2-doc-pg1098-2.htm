Remarks at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, on the Terrorist Attacks
September 11, 2001

    Freedom, itself, was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and 
freedom will be defended. I want to reassure the American people that 
the full resources of the Federal Government are working to assist local 
authorities to save lives and to help the victims of these attacks. Make 
no mistake: The United States will hunt down and punish those 
responsible for these cowardly acts.
    I've been in regular contact with the Vice President,<Cheney, 
Dick> the Secretary of Defense,<Rumsfeld, Donald H.> 
the national security team, and my Cabinet. We have taken all 
appropriate security precautions to protect the American people. Our 
military at home and around the world

is on high-alert status, and we have taken the necessary security 
precautions to continue the functions of your Government.
    We have been in touch with the leaders of Congress and with world 
leaders to assure them that we will do whatever is necessary to protect 
America and Americans.
    I ask the American people to join me in saying a thanks for all the 
folks who have been fighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens and to 
join me in saying a prayer for the victims and their families.
    The resolve of our great Nation is being tested. But make no 
mistake: We will show the world that we will pass this test.
    God bless.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 2:30 p.m. in the Dougherty 
Center. At 9:40 a.m., subsequent to the President's remarks in Sarasota, 
FL, American Airlines Flight 77, scheduled from Dulles International 
Airport to Los Angeles International Airport, crashed into the Pentagon. 
At 10:07 a.m., United Airlines Flight 93, scheduled from Newark 
International Airport to San Francisco International Airport, crashed 
near Shanksville, PA.
