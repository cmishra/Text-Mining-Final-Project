Radio Remarks on Read Across America Day
March 1, 2000

    On March 2, volunteers across the country will celebrate Dr. Seuss' 
birthday by reading to more than 20 million youngsters in the third 
annual Read Across America Day. The event brings together athletes, 
entertainers, and business leaders and others to help spread the joy of 
reading to our Nation's youth and to ensure that all children develop 
the reading skills they need to succeed in school and in life. I urge 
all Americans to participate.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at 3:45 p.m. on February 25 
in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast. The 
transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on March 1. 
These remarks were also made available on the White House Press Office 
Actuality Line.
