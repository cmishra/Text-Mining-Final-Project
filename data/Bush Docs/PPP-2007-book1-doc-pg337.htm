Message on the Observance of Nowruz
March 20, 2007

    I send greetings to those celebrating Nowruz.
    Nowruz is a special time of thanksgiving and celebration when 
millions of people around the world who trace their heritage to Iran, 
Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Pakistan, India, and Central Asia welcome the 
New Year. For thousands of years, it has been an occasion when family, 
friends, and loved ones come together to reflect on the blessings of the 
past year and look forward with a spirit of renewal and hope.
    America is strengthened by the rich cultural diversity of our 
people, and we are blessed to be a Nation that welcomes individuals of 
all races, religions, and cultural backgrounds. Celebrating Nowruz 
honors the values of family and tradition and helps preserve the unique 
fabric that makes up our country.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for health 
and happiness in the coming year.

                                                          George W. Bush
