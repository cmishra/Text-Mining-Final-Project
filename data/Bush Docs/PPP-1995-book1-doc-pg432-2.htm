Statement on the Major League Baseball Strike
March 30, 1995

    For the first time in months there is reason for some optimism for 
those of us who are hoping for a 1995 baseball season with real major 
league players.
    The players have agreed to return to work if the district court 
judge issues an injunction. If the judge does grant the injunction, I 
hope the owners decide to let the players play ball.
    In October, in an attempt to assist the parties, we appointed Bill 
Usery as special mediator with the hope that he could bring the owners 
and players together at the bargaining table, where

ultimately this dispute must be resolved. He has done his best to get 
that job done and will continue to do so.
    As the owners and players meet in these last few days before the 
scheduled start of the season, I hope they will give it their best shot, 
that they will bargain in good faith and be flexible and willing to 
compromise so that America's baseball fans again have a sport they can 
be proud of.
    Like millions of other fans across the country, I want to see the 
Ripkens, Gwynns, Bonds, Mattinglys, and Cones in uniform on the playing 
field. We're getting down to the wire. Let's hope the owners and players 
see the light for the sake of the fans and bring back Major League 
Baseball.
