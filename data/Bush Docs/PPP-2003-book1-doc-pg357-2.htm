Statement on the Peace Process in Sudan
April 22, 2003

    Today I informed Congress, consistent with the Sudan Peace Act, that 
the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement 
(SPLM) are negotiating in good faith and that negotiations should 
continue.
    Both sides have made significant progress negotiating a just and 
comprehensive peace for the people of Sudan. There is still much work 
remaining. Sporadic military activities, primarily but not exclusively 
by the Government, have hindered these efforts and must stop. Despite 
these challenges, negotiators are advancing toward peace, and I believe 
that the current process presents the best prospects for peace.
    It is now time to move the peace process to a new level where the 
actions of both parties replace promises as the measure of their 
commitment to peace. President Bashir<al-Bashir, Umar> Hasan 
Ahmad and Chairman Garang<Garang de Mabior, John 
must demonstrate the leadership necessary to ensure that their 
respective sides: 1) refrain from any hostile or provocative action; 2) 
complete negotiations on outstanding issues; and 3) sign and implement a 
comprehensive agreement.
    The United States fully supports the invaluable mediation efforts of 
the Government of Kenya. We stand ready with other members of the 
international community to support the implementation of a comprehensive 
agreement when it is finalized this June.

Note: The statement referred to President Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir of 
Sudan; and John Garang de Mabior, chairman, Sudan People's Liberation 
Movement. The Presidential determination of April 21 under the Sudan 
Peace Act is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
