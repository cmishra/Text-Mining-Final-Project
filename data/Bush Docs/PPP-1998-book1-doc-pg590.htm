Statement on the Anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing
April 19, 1998

    Three years ago today the people of Oklahoma City suffered the worst 
act of terrorism in our country's history. It was an attack not just on 
the people, a city, a State, a nation, but on what we stand for, how we 
govern ourselves, and the values we live by. During that time, we have 
worked to bring to justice those who were responsible for this crime. 
And during that time, all America has stood by the people of Oklahoma 
City as they have worked to rebuild their lives. Today, once again, our 
thoughts are with the families of the 168 people whose lives were 
tragically lost. Their courage and the resilience of Oklahoma City has 
shown us all the full meaning of community.
