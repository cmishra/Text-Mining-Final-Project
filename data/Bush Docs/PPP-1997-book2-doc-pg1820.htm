Message on the Observance of Kwanzaa, 1997
December 22, 1997

    Warm greetings to everyone observing Kwanzaa.
    As America embarks on a season of renewal and reconciliation, the 
principles of Kwanzaa--unity, self-determination, collective work and 
responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith--
ring true not only for African Americans, but also for all Americans. By 
emphasizing the importance of family in our lives and the blessings that 
come with a true commitment to community, opportunity, and 
responsibility, the celebration of Kwanzaa can help us to enter the 
future as a stronger nation and a more compassionate and united people.
    The symbols and ceremony of Kwanzaa, evoking the rich history and 
heritage of African Americans, remind us that our nation draws much of 
its strength from our diversity. As millions of Americans observe 
Kwanzaa this year, let us renew our commitment to realizing America's 
promise as a land where all people are free to pursue our common 
dreams--to live in peace, to provide for our families, and to give our 
children the opportunity for a better life.
    Hillary joins me in sending best wishes for a joyous Kwanzaa.

                                                            Bill Clinton
