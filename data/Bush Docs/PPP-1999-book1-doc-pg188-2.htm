Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on the Emigration Policies 
and Trade Status of Mongolia
February 11, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:
    On September 4, 1996, I determined and reported to the Congress that 
Mongolia was not in violation of the freedom of emigration criteria of 
sections 402(a) and 409(a) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. This 
action allowed for the continuation of normal trade relations status for 
Mongolia and certain other activities without the requirement of an 
annual waiver.
    As required by law, I am submitting an updated report to the 
Congress concerning the emigration laws and policies of Mongolia. The 
report indicates continued Mongolian compliance with U.S. and 
international standards in the area of emigration.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 11, 1999.
