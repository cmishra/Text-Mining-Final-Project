Message to the Senate Transmitting the Protocol to the Denmark-United 
States Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation
September 2, 2003

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol to the Treaty of 
Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation Between the United States and 
Denmark of October 1, 1951, signed at Copenhagen on May 2, 2001. I 
transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the report of the 
Department of State with respect to this protocol.

[[Page 1081]]

    The protocol will establish the legal basis by which the United 
States may issue treaty-investor (E-2) visas to qualified nationals of 
Denmark, by supplementing the U.S.-Denmark friendship, commerce, and 
navigation (FCN) treaty to allow for entry and sojourn of investors, a 
benefit provided in the large majority of U.S. FCN treaties. United 
States investors are already eligible for Danish visas that offer 
comparable benefits to those that would be accorded nationals of Denmark 
under E-2 visa status.
    The United States has long championed the benefits of an open 
investment climate, both at home and abroad. It is the policy of the 
United States to welcome market-driven foreign investment and to permit 
capital to flow freely to seek its highest return. Denmark also provides 
an open investment climate. Visas for investors facilitate investment 
activity, and thus directly support U.S. policy objectives.
    I recommend that the Senate consider this protocol as soon as 
possible, and give its advice and consent to ratification of the 
protocol at an early date.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 September 2, 2003.
