    You know, I've just--Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I just had the 
great joy and privilege of worshiping here in Beijing, China. You know, 
it just goes to show that God is universal and God is love and no state, 
man, or woman should fear the influence of loving religion.
    And I want to thank the pastor<Li Jian'an<ls-thn-eq> for his 
hospitality. And I want to thank this beautiful choir for singing 
``Amazing Grace'' and ``Edelweiss.'' It was a touching moment. It's been 
a joy to worship here. Again, I want to thank you, sir, and God bless 
you. God bless you.

Note: The President spoke at 9:07 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Pastor Li Jian'an, senior pastor, Beijing Kuanjie Protestant Christian 
Church.
