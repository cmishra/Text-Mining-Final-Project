Message to the Senate Transmitting the Second Additional Protocol to the 
Mexico-United States Taxation Convention
February 25, 2003

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification, 
the Second Additional Protocol that Modifies the Convention Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
United Mexican States for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the 
Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, signed at 
Mexico City on November 26, 2002. I also transmit, for the information 
of the Senate, the report of the Department of State concerning the 
proposed Protocol.
    The Convention, as amended by the proposed Protocol, would be 
similar to tax treaties between the United States and other developed 
nations. It would provide maximum rates of tax to be applied to various 
types of income and protection from double taxation of income. The 
Protocol was concluded in recognition of the importance of the United 
States economic relations with Mexico.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Protocol, and that the Senate give its advice and consent to 
ratification.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 February 25, 2003.
