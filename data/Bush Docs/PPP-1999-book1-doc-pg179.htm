Statement on the Death of King Hussein I<King Hussein I> of 
Jordan
February 7, 1999

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened by the news that King Hussein of 
Jordan has passed away. I had prayed this day would not come soon. But 
God has called King Hussein to his reward. The prayers of all Americans 
go out to the royal family and the Jordanian people.
    No words can convey what King Hussein meant to the people he led for 
nearly half a century. Words cannot convey what he meant to me as a 
friend and inspiration. Through good times and bad, through health and 
illness, he showed the power of a strong will applied to a worthy cause. 
It takes a rare kind of courage to be a peacemaker--the courage to learn 
from the past and imagine a better future. When peace finally comes to 
the Middle East, his name will be inscribed upon it. That day, King 
Hussein will smile on us one more time.
    I had the honor of seeing him just a few weeks ago, as he was about 
to return home. There was no hint of the struggle he was waging. 
Instead, he spoke with his usual passion and humanity about Jordan's 
well-being, the future of the Arab world, the Palestinian cause, and 
peace with Israel.

    To Queen Noor,<Queen Noor> to Crown Prince 
Abdullah,<Prince Abdullah (of Jordan)> to the King's family, 
and to the people of Jordan, Hillary and I send our condolences. The 
United States stands with you--today, tomorrow, and in the future. I ask 
all Americans to remember this good man and his family.

Note: The related proclamation of February 7 on the death of King 
Hussein is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
