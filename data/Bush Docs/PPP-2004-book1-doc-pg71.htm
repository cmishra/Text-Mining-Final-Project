Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Requesting 
Emergency Funding for the Department of the Interior's National Park 
Service
January 15, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    In accordance with provisions of the ``1997 Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations Act for Recovery from Natural Disasters, and for Overseas 
Peacekeeping Efforts, Including those in Bosnia'' (Public Law 105-18), I 
hereby request and make available $22.5 million in emergency funding for 
the Department of the Interior's National Park Service.
    These funds would allow for the repair and replacement of concession 
facilities at Yosemite National Park that were damaged in a 1997 flood.
    The Congress required that certain prerequisites be met before these 
funds could be released. These requirements have been met and I 
designate the funds made available today as an emergency requirement 
consistent with the requirements of Public Law 105-18.
    The details of this action are set forth in the attached letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
