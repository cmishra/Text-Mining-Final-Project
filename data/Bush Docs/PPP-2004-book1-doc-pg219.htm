Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Notice of Intention To 
Enter Into a Free Trade Agreement With Australia
February 13, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002 
(the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the Congress of my intent to 
enter into a free trade agreement (FTA) with the Government of 
Australia.
    This agreement will create new opportunities for America's workers, 
farmers, businesses, and consumers by eliminating barriers in trade with 
Australia. Australia is already a major trade and investment partner of 
the United States, as well as one of the strongest and most dependable 
friends this country has ever had. This agreement will provide 
opportunities to further deepen this important relationship, for the 
mutual benefit of our two nations.
    Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at 
least 90 days in advance of signing the United States-Australia FTA. My 
Administration looks forward to working with the Congress in developing 
appropriate legislation to approve and implement this free trade 
agreement.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
