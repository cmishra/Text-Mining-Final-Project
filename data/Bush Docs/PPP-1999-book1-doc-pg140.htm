Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting Budget Rescissions and 
Deferrals
February 1, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    In accordance with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control 
Act of 1974, I herewith report three rescissions of budget authority, 
totaling $35 million; one new deferral of $185 million of budget 
authority; and, two revised deferrals of budget authority, totaling $1.5 
billion.
    The proposed rescissions affect the programs of the Department of 
Interior, Unanticipated Needs for Natural Disasters, and International 
Assistance Programs. The proposed deferrals affect programs of the 
Department of State and International Assistance Programs.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
An original was not available for verification of the content of this 
letter. The report detailing the rescissions and deferrals was published 
in the Federal Register on February 10.
