Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not To Seek Reelection
July 1, 2002

    Congressman J.C. Watts has served the people of Oklahoma and the 
United States with honor and distinction as a Member of the U.S. House 
of Representatives.
    J.C. will leave behind a legacy of compassion and commitment to 
public service. He has been a leader in highlighting the success of 
faith-based and community-based organizations, and thanks to his 
efforts, these organizations may soon have additional resources in their 
fight against abuse, addiction, and poverty. His leadership was 
recognized by members of his party, and as Chairman of the House 
Republican Conference Committee, J.C. has effectively promoted the 
positive agenda of the Republican Party.

to offer his country, and I know he will continue to

thank him for his dedicated service.
