Remarks on the Search for John F. Kennedy, Jr.,<Kennedy, John F., 
Jr.> Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,<Kennedy, Carolyn 
Bessette> and Lauren Bessette<Bessette, Lauren>
July 18, 1999

    As the search continues, I want to express our family's support, and 
offer our prayers and those of all Americans for John Kennedy, Jr.; his 
wife, Carolyn; her sister Lauren; and to their fine families.
    I also want to thank the Coast Guard and all those who have worked 
so hard in this endeavor.
    For more than 40 years now, the Kennedy family has inspired 
Americans to public service, strengthened our faith in the future, and 
moved our Nation forward. Through it all they have suffered much, and 
given more.
    In recent years, in particular, John Kennedy, Jr., and Carolyn have 
captured our imagination and won our affection. I will always be 
grateful for their kindnesses to Hillary and Chelsea and me.
    At this difficult moment, we hope the families of these three fine 
young people will feel the strength of God, the love of their friends, 
and the prayers of their fellow citizens.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 4:13 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to the search and rescue efforts off
