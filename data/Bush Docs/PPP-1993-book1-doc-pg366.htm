Nomination for Three Ambassadorial Posts
March 26, 1993

    The President named three senior Foreign Service officers to key 
Latin American ambassadorial posts today, announcing his intention to 
nominate John Maisto to be Ambassador to Nicaragua, James Cheek to be 
Ambassador to Argentina, and William Pryce to be Ambassador to Honduras.
    ``Our relationships with our Latin American neighbors are among the 
most important we have,'' said the President. ``I am very glad to be 
putting them into steady hands today.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
