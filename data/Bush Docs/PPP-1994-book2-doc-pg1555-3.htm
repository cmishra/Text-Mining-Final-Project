Message to the Senate Transmitting the France-United States
Taxation Convention
September 15, 1994

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of the French Republic for the Avoidance of Double 
Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on 
Income and Capital, signed at Paris on August 31, 1994, together with 
two related exchanges of notes. Also transmitted for the information of 
the Senate is the report of the

Department of State with respect to the Convention.
    The Convention replaces the 1967 income tax convention between the 
United States of America and the French Republic and the related 
protocols and exchanges of notes. The new Convention more accurately 
reflects current income tax treaty policies of the two countries.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Convention and related exchanges of notes and give its advice and 
consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
September 15, 1994.
