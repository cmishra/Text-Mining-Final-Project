Statement on Senate Passage of Port Security Improvement Legislation
September 14, 2006

    Today the Senate passed legislation to strengthen my 
administration's efforts to secure our ports and detect dangers before 
they reach America's shores.
    By furthering our coordination with responsible countries throughout 
the world, the ``Port Security Improvement Act of 2006'' will help 
secure the global supply chain and help ensure the smooth flow of 
commerce into and out of the United States. I am pleased this bill 
codifies several administration efforts that have already substantially 
improved security at our ports, including the Container Security 
Initiative,

which identifies and inspects cargo at foreign ports before they are 
placed on vessels destined for the United States, and the Customs-Trade 
Partnership Against Terrorism, which helps our international trading 
partners secure their supply chains before shipping goods into our 
country.
    I look forward to the House and Senate resolving their differences 
in conference and sending this legislation to me for my signature.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 4954.
