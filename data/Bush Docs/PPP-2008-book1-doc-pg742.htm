to the Ford's Theatre gala, and this is by far the best.
    We want to thank our choir and our orchestra and all the fabulous 
performers for taking time out of your busy schedules to help--to 
support this really important part of Washington. And Gatlin<Gatlin, 
Larry<ls-thn-eq> is probably saying, of course, I said that for the 
crowd last year. [Laughter] But no, it really was fantastic. And it's 
such an uplifting performance and a reminder of what a great President 
Abraham Lincoln was.
    I do want to thank Paul Tetreault<Tetreault, Paul R.<ls-thn-eq> for 
being a really fabulous director of the Ford's Theatre. And I want to 
thank the gala cochairs and all the people who support the Ford's 
Theatre. I know you're excited about the opening of the renovated Ford's 
Theatre in February 2009. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are excited 
too. Just send the pictures down to Crawford. [Laughter]
    Thanks for a fabulous evening, and God bless.
