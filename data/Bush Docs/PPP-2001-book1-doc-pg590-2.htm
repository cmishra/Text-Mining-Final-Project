Statement on the Global Forum on Fighting Corruption and Safeguarding 
Integrity II
May 28, 2001

    The corruption of governmental institutions threatens the common 
aspirations of all honest members of the international community. It 
threatens our common interests in promoting political and economic 
stability, upholding core democratic values, ending the reign of 
dictators, and creating a level playing field for lawful business 
activities.
    A few short years ago, talking openly about corruption was 
considered taboo. Today, however, officials from many countries are 
meeting and working together to demand greater transparency and 
accountability in public affairs. From Asia to Europe to Africa to the 
Americas, these efforts are exposing corrupt practices to the sunshine 
of public scrutiny, where, ultimately, they cannot survive.

    This week the second Global Forum on Fighting Corruption and 
Safeguarding Integrity will help to keep the promotion of integrity and 
transparency high on the international agenda. I want to underscore the 
United States' support for the Global Forum's work, applaud the large 
number of participating states, and especially, thank the Government of 
The Netherlands for hosting this event.
    Increasing accountability and transparency in governance around the 
world is an important foreign policy objective for my administration. 
The United States is committed to bringing renewed energy to the global 
anticorruption agenda and to increasing the effectiveness of the 
American policies and programs that address this important issue.
    I salute the work of delegates to the second Global Forum, and I 
strongly support your important objectives.
