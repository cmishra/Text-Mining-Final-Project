Statement on Signing the Department of Transportation and Related 
Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002
December 18, 2001

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2299, the ``Department of 
Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002.''
    I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this 
Act. The bill abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for 
Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion and supports several of my 
Administration's key initiatives with:


[[Page 1527]]


  <bullet>   $140 million for border safety to ensure an open border for 
            trade between the United States and Mexico through the 
            establishment of an inspection and certification system that 
            will ensure a high level of motor carrier safety;
  <bullet>   $5 billion for Coast Guard operations and capital expenses, 
            including $243 million to support expanded drug interdiction 
            efforts as authorized in the Western Hemisphere Drug 
            Elimination Act;
  <bullet>   $1.2 billion for the newly created Transportation Security 
            Administration to enhance airport and aircraft security;
  <bullet>   $32.8 billion for key highway infrastructure and safety 
            initiatives in compliance with authorized levels;
  <bullet>   $10.2 billion for aviation operations and airport 
            improvement grants to expand safety, security, and capacity; 
            and
  <bullet>   $6.7 billion for mass transit grants and capital programs.

    Several provisions in the bill purport to require congressional 
approval before executive branch execution of aspects of the bill. I 
will interpret such provisions to require notification only, since any 
other interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS v. 
Chadha.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 December 18, 2001.

Note: H.R. 2299, approved December 18, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
87.
