Remarks at a Celebration of Greek Independence Day
March 23, 2007

    The President. Your Eminence,<Trakatellis, Archbishop 
Demetrios<ls-thn-eq> thanks. It's great to have you back at the White 
House. One of the joys about being the President is, you get to meet 
some pretty interesting people. And I will tell Your Eminence, I value 
our friendship. You're such a gentle soul, and it gives me great--it 
soothes my spirit to be with you. I appreciate your prayers, and I 
appreciate your leadership, and I am proud to join you in celebrating 
the 186th anniversary of Greek independence. And we're glad you're here. 
Thanks for coming.
    As you can tell, there is going to be a series of orations, and then 
you get to go have some refreshments. [Laughter] I appreciate the 
leaders of the Greek American community who are here with us today. Our 
country is home to 1.2 million Greek Americans--actually, more than 
that. And, Your Eminence,<Trakatellis, Archbishop Demetrios<ls-thn-eq> 
Greek Americans have really enriched our culture and enriched our 
Nation's heritage. They're a lively bunch, as you know--[laughter]----
    Archbishop Demetrios.<Trakatellis, Archbishop Demetrios<ls-thn-eq> 
Absolutely.
    The President. ----but an important group of people in our country, 
and that's really what we celebrate here. We celebrate our friendship 
with the nation of Greece.
    And, Madam Foreign Minister,<Bakoyannis, Dora<ls-thn-eq> thanks for 
coming. I talked to Condi<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> about her

[[Page 342]]

discussions with you. We have a lot to do together, and I appreciate 
your leadership.
    I thank the Ambassador<Mallias, Alexandros P.<ls-thn-eq> for joining 
us today. Mr. Ambassador, thanks. Thanks for bringing 
Francoise,<Mallias, Francoise A.<ls-thn-eq> wife. I appreciate the 
Ambassador from--the Cypriot Ambassador<Kakouris, Andreas S.<ls-thn-eq> 
to the United States. Andreas, thank you for coming. Appreciate you 
being here. Thank you for bringing your wife Kareen.<Kakouris, Kareen 
Farrell<ls-thn-eq>
    I want to thank Nick Burns<Burns, R. Nicholas<ls-thn-eq> for being 
here, former Ambassador to Greece from the United States, now top 
official at the State Department. One of my top advisers happens to be a 
Greek American--Fran Townsend,<Townsend, Frances Fragos<ls-thn-eq> Fran 
Fragos Townsend--[laughter]--whose advice I listen to on a regular 
basis, Your Eminence.<Trakatellis, Archbishop Demetrios<ls-thn-eq> Thank 
you for serving.
    I appreciate Members of Congress who have come. Thank you all for 
taking time: Congressmen Carolyn Maloney<Maloney, Carolyn 
Bosher<ls-thn-eq> from New York, Gus Bilirakis<Bilirakis, Gus<ls-thn-eq> 
from Florida, John Sarbanes<Sarbanes, John<ls-thn-eq> from Maryland, 
Zack Space<Space, Zack<ls-thn-eq> from Ohio. I appreciate you all 
coming. You're welcome to be here.
    I want to thank Father<Karloutsos, Alex<ls-thn-eq> Alex--wherever 
you are--there he is. Father Alex, yes, trying to be as low profile as 
possible. [Laughter] Appreciate you coming, and thanks for your 
continued friendship.
    I want to thank members of the United States military, Greek 
Americans who wear the uniform of the United States. I thank you for 
your service; I thank you for your dedication; I thank you for your 
stalwart defense of freedom and peace.
    As you mentioned, Your Eminence,<Trakatellis, Archbishop 
Demetrios<ls-thn-eq> in 1821, the people of Greece proclaimed their 
independence, and they risked their lives to secure liberty. They knew 
that their land had been the home of the first democratic society, the 
first place in the world where people could choose their leaders, speak 
their minds, and freely explore the arts and the sciences.
    These Greek patriots also knew that freedom and democracy were more 
than just a legacy, that they were their destiny. And they believed, 
like I believe, that freedom is the hope of all mankind, not just a few 
people, but of all mankind.
    And when they made their stand for freedom and independence, they 
found a lot of friends in this country: Americans who express their 
support by contributing funds, and some who volunteer to serve in the 
new Greek Army. Americans stood with Greece again after World War II, 
when violent Communist insurgents threatened Greece's free Government. 
As you mentioned, President Truman saw the danger, and he articulated a 
new and bold doctrine for our country. In an address to the United 
States Congress, he put it this way: ``It must be the policy of the 
United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted 
subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.''
    Like democracy itself, the Truman Doctrine grew out of the 
experience of the Greek people and affirmed the desire for freedom for 
all people--not just a handful, not just some, but for all.
    Today, Greece and the United States are allies in the cause of 
freedom, Madam Minister,<Bakoyannis, Dora<ls-thn-eq> and I want you to 
send thanks to your Government. In Afghanistan, a Greek engineering team 
provides support to the International Security Assistance Force; a Greek 
medical team provides emergency care to those who are wounded. And we 
thank you very much.
    In Lebanon, Greek naval units are part of a UNIFIL force supporting 
the democratic Siniora Government. These Greek forces are serving with 
courage; they're helping young democracies who struggle against the 
forces of evil. And I appreciate your vision. I appreciate the good work 
that we're doing to lay the foundation of peace for generations to come. 
It is hard work, Madam Minister,<Bakoyannis, Dora<ls-thn-eq> but it is 
necessary work.
    I appreciate the important help Greece has provided to Americans who 
find themselves in danger overseas. Last summer, Greece was one of the 
first nations to offer ships to help evacuate Americans who

found themselves stranded in Lebanon following Hizballah's unprovoked 
terrorist attacks on Israel. We called for your help, and you delivered, 
and we appreciate that a lot. That's what friends do.
    In January, the Greek Government responded quickly following a 
grenade attack on our Embassy in Athens. And we appreciate the 
determination of Greek authorities to bring those responsible for this 
attack to justice. We're grateful for the many messages of sympathy and 
support we've received after those attacks.
    We also share with Greece important ties of faith, Your 
Eminence.<Trakatellis, Archbishop Demetrios<ls-thn-eq> The Greek 
Orthodox Church counts more than 1 million members in the United States, 
and it plays a vital role in the spiritual life of our Nation. Your 
Eminence, I thank you and congratulate you on 40 years of ministry as a 
bishop. You're providing necessary and important leadership here in the 
United States. You are a man of wisdom. You're a man of prayer. I 
appreciated your thoughtful response to me and Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> after the September the 11th attacks. These were tough 
times for our Nation, and your comforting call meant a lot to me.
    I thank you for your determination to rebuild what was lost on that 
terrible day. On 9/11, the terrorists who struck Manhattan brought down 
not only magnificent skyscrapers but a humble house of worship. Before 
those attacks, St. Nicholas Church stood just south of the second tower 
of the World Trade Center. Your vision is for a new St. Nicholas to rise 
just a few steps from its original site. And with your help, St. 
Nicholas will once again be a sanctuary of faith in New York's financial 
district and a new center of reconciliation for visitors from all over 
the world.
    I thank you very much, Your Eminence,<Trakatellis, Archbishop 
Demetrios<ls-thn-eq> for gracing this house. This is the people's house. 
This belongs to everybody who's an American. I thank you for your vision 
of peace. I thank you for your spirituality. And I thank you for joining 
me as we celebrate Greek Independence Day.
    May God bless you all.
