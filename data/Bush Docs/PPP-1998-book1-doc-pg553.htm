Statement on School Crime
April 12, 1998

    Today the Attorney General<Reno, Janet<ls-thn-eq> and Secretary of 
Education<Riley, Richard W.<ls-thn-eq> forwarded to me an important, but 
troubling, study on school crime. Although the study shows that the 
overall crime rate in our schools did not change significantly between 
1989 and 1995, it confirms that some schools have serious problems. Most 
disturbing, the study found that the number of students reporting gangs 
in their schools has nearly doubled. This is unacceptable. Gangs--and 
the guns, drugs, and violence that go with them--must be stopped from 
ever reaching the schoolhouse door.
    Congress can help lead the way by passing the antigang and youth 
violence strategy that I sent to them more than a year ago. It is based 
on what we know works--tough, targeted deterrence and better antigang 
prevention. Through this approach, police and prosecutors in Boston 
literally disarmed the gangs and brought juvenile gun murders to a halt. 
We should not wait any longer to help other communities do the same.

Note: This statement was made available by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on April 11, but it was embargoed for released until 6:30 p.m. 
on April 12.
