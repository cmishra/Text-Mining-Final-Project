Statement on the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation 
Movement Comprehensive Peace Agreement
January 9, 2005

    I congratulate the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement on the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement. I 
thank all the officials of the United States Government who have worked 
hard to help achieve this agreement, including Secretary of State Colin 
Powell,<Powell, Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> former Special Envoy for Sudan,

Ambassador John Danforth,<Danforth, John C.<ls-thn-eq> and the Special 
Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, USAID Administrator Andrew 
Natsios.<Natsios, Andrew S.<ls-thn-eq> I also thank the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which sponsored the talks, 
and the Government of Kenya, which hosted them, and the Governments of 
Norway and the United Kingdom and the African Union, which played 
constructive roles for peace.
    Both sides should be proud of this accomplishment. The difficult 
work of implementation must now begin. Only the implementation of this 
agreement in good faith can result in long-term peace and development.
    As we celebrate this positive movement toward peace in the 
longstanding North-South conflict, we remember the conflict in Darfur 
and the suffering it causes. This comprehensive peace agreement should 
serve as an inspiration and model for both sides in their work toward 
negotiating a peaceful resolution of the Darfur conflict. I call on the 
Government of Sudan and on all Darfur rebel groups to live up to their 
cease-fire commitments, to end atrocities, and to allow the free 
movement of humanitarian workers and supplies. The United States will 
continue to assist the people of Darfur in reaching a just and lasting 
peace.
