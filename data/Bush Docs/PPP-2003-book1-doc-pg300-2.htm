Statement on the Death of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan<Moynihan, 
Daniel> Patrick
March 26, 2003

    Laura and I are saddened by the death of Senator Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan. Senator Moynihan was an intellectual pioneer and a trusted 
adviser to Presidents of both parties. I appreciated his service to my 
administration as Co-Chairman of my Commission to Strengthen Social 
Security. Representing the people of New York for 24 years, Senator 
Moynihan was a leader in

the Senate and was recognized for his commitment to free trade, Social 
Security, freedom for people around the world, and equal opportunity for 
all Americans. He committed his life to service and will be sorely 
missed. We express our deepest sympathies to Senator Moynihan's family.
