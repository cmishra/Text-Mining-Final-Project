Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Amendments
May 1, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to the 
Administration's FY 2004 budget submission for the Department of 
Defense.
    In total, these amendments would not affect the budgetary resources 
proposed in my FY 2004 Budget.
    The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
