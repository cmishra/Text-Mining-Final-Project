Statement on the Resignation of Deputy Assistant to the President and 
Director of Media Affairs Jeff Eller
August 2, 1994

    From the earliest days of my campaign for President through our 
first year and a half in the White House, Jeff has served with 
dedication and uncompromising loyalty. He played a vital role in 
redefining the technological means used to communicate my policies and 
programs, and I will miss his service and counsel.

Note: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary 
announcing that Mr. Eller would be leaving the administration in 
September.
