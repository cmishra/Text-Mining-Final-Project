Remarks During a Visit to a White House Staff Member at Inova Fairfax 
Hospital and an Exchange With Reporters in Fairfax, Virginia
July 3, 2001

    The President. You know, when you come, it reminds us of the 
responsibilities that we have in life. And Vivienne<Sayle, 
Vivienne> is lucky to have a mother<Sayle, Desiree> 
and dad<Sayle, Stephen> who will love her all the time. And 
she doesn't know it, yet, but she's learning pretty quickly. She's less 
than 24 hours old.
    We also have a responsibility to make sure our education systems 
provide excellence for every child.
    We have a responsibility--and Congress needs to bring me a bill that 
will help the patients who come to these hospitals maintain reasonable 
insurance, and a bill that doesn't help lawyers.
    We have a responsibility to encourage love all throughout our 
communities. That's why the Faith-Based Initiative is so important. A 
lot of babies are born sometimes where the--some babies are born where 
people just don't love them like they should. And as a society, we've 
got to make up for that love. Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet 
with service organizations all across--representing people from all 
across the country, committed to finding a million mentors to love 
children.
    The good news for this little baby<Sayle, Vivienne> is, 
she's got a mom<Sayle, Desiree> and dad<Sayle, 
Stephen> who know their responsibilities. It's a great Fourth 
of July gift. Congratulations.
    Okay.

    Q. Mr. President, do you know when you'll actually make a decision

referred to Vivienne Anna Sayle, daughter of Desiree Sayle, Director of 
Correspondence for the First Lady, and attorney Stephen Sayle.
