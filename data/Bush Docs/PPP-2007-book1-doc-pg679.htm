Statement on the Resignation of Daniel J. Bartlett<Bartlett, Daniel 
J.<ls-thn-eq> as Counselor to the President
June 1, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I will miss Dan Bartlett very much. 
Dan has been a true counselor to the President. His contribution has 
been immeasurable. I value his judgment, and I treasure his friendship. 
Since coming to work for me 14 years ago as I prepared to run for 
Governor, Dan has become a husband and a father. I understand his 
decision to make his young family his first priority. His most important 
job is to be a loving husband and father of three young sons. We wish 
him all the best.
