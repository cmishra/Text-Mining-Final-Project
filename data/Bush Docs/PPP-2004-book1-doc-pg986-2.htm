Message to the Congress Transmitting a Determination on Trade With 
Vietnam
June 3, 2004

To the Congress of the United States:
    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``Act''), as amended, with respect to the 
continuation of a waiver of application of subsections (a) and (b) of 
section 402 of the Act to Vietnam. This document constitutes my 
recommendation to continue in effect this waiver for a further 12-month 
period and includes my determination that continuation of the waiver 
currently in effect for Vietnam will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402 of the Act and my reasons for such 
determination.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 June 3, 2004.

Note: The Presidential determination of June 3 is listed in Appendix D 
at the end of this volume.
