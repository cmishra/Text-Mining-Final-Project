Statement on Signing the Continuing Appropriations Resolution
September 30, 1993

    Today I have signed into law House Joint Resolution 267, a 
Continuing Resolution that funds the operations of the Federal 
Government during October 1-21, 1993.
    A Continuing Resolution is necessary at this time in order to keep 
the Government functioning while the Congress completes the 
appropriations process.
    I commend the Congress for presenting me with a funding measure that 
provides for a simple, temporary extension of normal Government 
operations and is free of extraneous amendments. I urge the Congress to 
complete the regular appropriations process by October 21 so that a 
second Continuing Resolution can be avoided.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
September 30, 1993.

Note: H.J. Res. 267, approved September 30, was assigned Public Law No. 
103-88.
