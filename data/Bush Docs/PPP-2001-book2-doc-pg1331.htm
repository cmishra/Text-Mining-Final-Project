Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Sudan
October 31, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the Sudan emergency is to continue in 
effect beyond November 3, 2001, to the Federal Register for publication. 
The most recent notice continuing this emergency was published in the 
Federal Register on November 2, 2000 (65 Fed. Reg. 66163).
    The crisis between the United States and Sudan constituted by the 
actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, including continuing 
concern about its record on terrorism and the prevalence of human rights 
violations, including slavery, restrictions on religious freedom, and 
restrictions on political freedom, that led to the declaration of a 
national emergency on November 3, 1997, has not been resolved. These 
actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests and pose a continuing 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that 
it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect 
to Sudan and maintain in force the comprehensive sanctions against Sudan 
to respond to this threat.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 October 31, 2001.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
November 1. The notice of October 31 is listed in Appendix D at the end 
of this volume.
