Remarks Prior to a Discussion on the United States Afro-Colombian 
Outreach Program in Bogota
March 11, 2007

    Well, Mr. President,<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> thank you very 
much. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I, as well as Secretary of State 
Rice<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> and our Ambassador,<Wood, William 
B.<ls-thn-eq> are honored that citizens from your country have come to 
share with us stories and concerns that will better enable our 
Government to help. And the reason I say that is because the best 
foreign policy for the United States is to help people realize their 
full potential. That can be done through education, jobs.
    The President<Uribe Velez, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> and I had a long 
discussion this morning about issues that will help create jobs and 
facilitate the flow of trade, for example, all aiming at helping the 
people in our respective countries realize God-given potential. And so 
we come bringing the greetings of the people of the United States. Our 
Ambassador<Wood, William B.<ls-thn-eq> has briefed me on some of the 
programs that the taxpayers of my country have helped fund. But we're 
really interested in hearing your stories. And Colombia is a fine 
democracy. And the true test of a democracy is for every citizen in that 
country to be able to feel the full promise of society.
    And so we thank you for coming. And, Mr. President,<Uribe Velez, 
Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> why don't we--we can go around the table, and I'm 
interested in hearing the different stories about the lives of some of 
your citizens.
    Shall we start? How about you, doctor? Do you want to start?

[At this point, the public portion of the event concluded; the 
discussion continued, however, and no transcript was provided.]

Note: The President spoke at 4:28 p.m. at Casa de Narino. In his 
remarks, he referred to President Alvaro Uribe Velez of Colombia and 
U.S. Ambassador to Colombia William B. Wood.
