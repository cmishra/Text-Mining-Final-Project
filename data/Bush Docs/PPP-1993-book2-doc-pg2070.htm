Statement on the Technology Reinvestment Project
November 24, 1993

    We're putting the people and expertise that helped America win the 
cold war to work on restoring America's industrial competitiveness. We 
are bringing together private industry, State and local governments, and 
community colleges to form technology deployment alliances. Together 
they will see to it that small manufacturers have access to the latest 
and best information, techniques, equipment, and know-how.
    The TRP's industrial outreach program is designed to promote the 
best in American manufacturing practices and expertise. We mean to 
recreate in industrial America the same success that the agricultural 
extension programs had in making America number one in agriculture. The 
States have pioneered programs to apply technology to industrial needs. 
With a Federal partner, these programs can help smaller defense firms 
adjust and compete in commercial markets. The goal is a simple one: more 
jobs for American workers.

Note: This statement was included in a White House announcement of the 
second group of awards in the technology reinvestment project.
