Message on the Observance of Easter, 2000
April 21, 2000

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Easter.
    In this holy season, Christians across America and around the world 
relive the events of Jesus' life, death, and Resurrection, rejoice in 
His fulfillment of the promise of salvation, and give prayerful thanks 
for the assurance of God's forgiving love.
    As Christians, we have been called to share that forgiveness with 
others. Across the globe, in places large and small, we have witnessed 
the tragic consequences of humanity's refusal to forgive. Ancient feuds, 
ethnic tensions, old hatreds and prejudices--these have torn apart 
families, communities, and nations for decades and continue to bring 
suffering to our world. On this, the first Easter of the new millennium 
and in the Jubilee Year of Christ's birth, the challenge to each of us 
is to reflect God's love and forgiveness in all our actions.
    Let us strive to see beyond the surface differences that may divide 
us from one another by discovering the values we share. Let us work

together to lift the yoke of poverty and oppression that crushes so many 
lives around the world. Let us recognize that, in Jesus' Resurrection, 
we see both the promise and the proof of love's capacity to triumph over 
the forces of misunderstanding, fear, and hatred.
    As millions of Americans gather with loved ones to share the joy of 
this blessed holiday, Hillary and I extend our best wishes to all for a 
wonderful Easter celebration.

                                                            Bill Clinton
