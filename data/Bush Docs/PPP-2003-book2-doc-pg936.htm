Remarks at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on the Death of Bob Hope
July 28, 2003

    Today America lost a great citizen. We mourn the passing of Bob 
Hope. Bob Hope made us laugh, and he lifted our spirits. Bob Hope served 
our Nation when he went to battlefields to entertain thousands of troops 
from different generations. We extend our prayers to his family, and we 
mourn the loss of a good man. May God bless his soul.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 9:50 a.m. prior to departure for 
Pittsburgh, PA. A tape was not available for verification of the content 
of these remarks.
