Statement on the Tornado Disaster in Georgia
March 20, 1998

    Today I spoke with Governor Zell Miller<Miller, Zell<ls-thn-eq> to 
express my concern over the tornado that hit Georgia early this morning. 
Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the individuals who lost 
their lives in this tragic disaster.
    I have asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to add the 
counties of Hall, White, Habersham, Dawson, and Rabun as disaster areas 
to the existing disaster declaration I issued for Georgia on March 11th. 
This action will allow victims of this tragedy to apply for Federal 
funds. I have also asked FEMA Director James Lee Witt<Witt, James 
Lee<ls-thn-eq> to lead a Federal team to Georgia to inspect the damage 
and report back to me.
    Labor Secretary Alexis Herman<Herman, Alexis M.<ls-thn-eq> has 
approved a grant of up to $3 million to assist workers who lost jobs. 
The money will help to create temporary jobs to assist in clean-up, 
repair, and restoration efforts. In addition, FEMA has begun working on 
a long-term recovery plan for Georgia.
    I want to assure the people of Georgia that this administration is 
committed to ensuring a speedy recovery from this tornado. Our thoughts 
and prayers are with those affected by this extraordinary natural 
disaster.
