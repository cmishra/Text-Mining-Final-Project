Message on the Observance of Ramadan
November 5, 2002

    I send greetings to Muslims in the United States and around the 
world as you observe the holy month of Ramadan.
    Islam is a peace-loving faith that is practiced by more than one 
billion people, including millions of American Muslims. These proud 
citizens contribute to the diversity that makes our country strong, and 
the United States is grateful for the friendship and support of many 
Muslim Nations that are vital partners in the global coalition to fight 
against terrorism.
    The Qur'an teaches that Ramadan is a time for fasting, prayer, 
worship, and contemplation. Muslims observe this month by renewing their 
dedication to caring for those in need, doing good deeds, and 
strengthening family and community ties. These actions reflect many of 
the values that Muslims share with people of other faiths across our 
Nation and around the world, including courage, compassion, and service.
    America remains committed to freedom, justice, and opportunity for 
all people. During this season of reverence and examination, we continue 
to work together for a future of peace, tolerance, and understanding. 
Laura joins me in sending our best wishes for a blessed time. May you

be well during Ramadan and throughout the coming year.

                                                          George W. Bush
