Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency With Respect to the Lapse of the Export Administration Act of 
1979
August 7, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency caused by the lapse of the 
Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, is to continue in effect 
beyond August 17, 2003, to the Federal Register for publication.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The notice of August 7 is listed in Appendix D at the end of 
this volume.
