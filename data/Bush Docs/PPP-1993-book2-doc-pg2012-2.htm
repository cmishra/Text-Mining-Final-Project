Nomination for United States District Court Judges
November 18, 1993

    The President today nominated two U.S. district court judges for 
Louisiana: Tucker Melancon for the Western District, and Helen 
``Ginger'' Berrigan for the Eastern District.
    ``I have pledged to the American people that I would appoint Federal 
judges committed to public service,'' said the President. ``In Tucker 
Melancon and Ginger Berrigan, the people of Louisiana will have just 
that.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
