Statement on the Executive Order on Federal Pollution Prevention
August 4, 1993

    With this Executive order, the Federal facilities will set the 
example for the rest of the country and become the leader in applying 
pollution prevention to daily operations, purchasing decisions, and 
policies. In the process, Federal facilities will reduce toxic 
emissions, which helps avoid cleanup costs and promotes clean 
technologies.

Note: The President's statement was included in a White House statement 
announcing the signing of the Executive order of August 3, which is 
listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
