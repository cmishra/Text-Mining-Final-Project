Nomination for Energy Department and Ambassadorial Posts
April 22, 1993

    The President announced today that he will nominate Archer Durham, a 
retired Major General in the U.S. Air Force, to be Assistant Secretary 
of Energy for Human Resources and Administration. He also formally 
announced his intent to nominate Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn to be 
Ambassador to the Holy See.
    ``Through his long and exemplary career in the Air Force, Archer 
Durham had a reputation of being a hands-on manager who consistently led 
the Air Force in management efficiency indicators,'' said the President. 
``Secretary O'Leary has called for that kind of management at her 
Department, and I am glad that General Durham will be providing it.''
    ``I am also very pleased to be formally announcing my intention to 
nominate Mayor Flynn for the important post of Ambassador to the Holy 
See,'' the President added. ``As I said on St. Patrick's Day here at the 
White House, he has been one of the best mayors to serve in my lifetime, 
and I think he'll do a great job in a wide range of areas.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
