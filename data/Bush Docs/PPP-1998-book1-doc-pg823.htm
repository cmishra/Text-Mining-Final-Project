Remarks on Presenting the Commander in Chief's Trophy to the
United States Air Force Academy Falcons
May 21, 1998

    The President. General Shelton,<Shelton, Henry H.<ls-thn-eq> General 
Ryan,<Ryan, Michael E.<ls-thn-eq> Senator Thurmond,<Thurmond, 
Strom<ls-thn-eq> Lieutenant General Oelstrom,<Oelstrom, Tad<ls-thn-eq> 
Coach Fisher DeBerry;<DeBerry, Fisher<ls-thn-eq> to the entire Air Force 
Academy team, at least the first classmen who are here today, and all of 
our other guests, friends, and members of the Air Force football staff, 
and others, I am very pleased to present the Commander in Chief's Trophy 
to the United States Air Force Academy again. [Laughter]
    This is the 11th time the Air Force has won the trophy. Since I have 
been President, I have presented it to the Falcons every year except 
1996. That's 5 out of 6 years. I'm good luck for you folks. [Laughter] 
You might ought to think about repealing the 22d amendment. [Laughter]
    The record of the Air Force Academy is so remarkable that I have 
asked Secretary Cohen to include a special analysis of your success in 
the next quadrennial defense review. We may try to apply it to other 
areas of our endeavor. [Laughter]
    This team showed real character, winning its first 7 games, ending 
up 10 and 2. Charles Gilliam<Gilliam, Charles<ls-thn-eq> rushed for 741 
yards. Lane Morgan<Morgan, Lane<ls-thn-eq> rushed for six touchdowns and 
threw for 975 yards. Chris Gizzi,<Gizzi, Chris<ls-thn-eq> whom I just 
met, had 179 tackles, the second highest number in school history. And 
he proved over and over again, I understand, that he has a real nose for 
football. [Laughter] For the members of the press that are here, I 
understand he had his nose stitched up after every game.
    Coach DeBerry,<DeBerry, Fisher<ls-thn-eq> as always, you deserve a 
lot of credit for this team's outstanding performance. You're the 
winningest coach in Academy history. Your knowledge of the game, your 
calm leadership are always indispensable to the team's success.
    I understand, and I have seen on occasion, that you tend to excite 
your team with unexpected displays of emotion on the sideline. And I was 
told, before I came out here, that part of the reason that these Falcons 
flew so high is that they were supremely pumped up by the chicken dance 
you did after beating Navy and Army. [Laughter]
    One of my predecessors, and one of my favorite predecessors, Teddy 
Roosevelt, would admire this team. In 1900, he wrote a book called ``The 
Strenuous Life,'' in which he said: ``In life, as in a football game, 
the principle to follow is hit the line hard.'' Your competitive drive, 
teamwork, and hard work brought you here. And I hope you will continue 
to hit the line hard in your careers and in your service to our Nation.
    All of us here are very, very proud of the Academy football programs 
at all three of our service academies and the fine example you set as 
scholar athletes. But the 1997 Falcons have proven beyond question that 
they deserve the Commander in Chief Trophy. Your timing couldn't have 
been better. Last fall we celebrated in the 50th anniversary of the Air 
Force, and you gave something extra to cheer for.
    Again, let me repeat my congratulations to the team, the coach, to 
the entire Air Force Academy. You not only aim high, you find what you 
aim for. Congratulations.
    Now I'd like to ask Lieutenant General Oelstrom<Oelstrom, 
Tad<ls-thn-eq> to come up and continue the program.
    Thank you very much.

[At this point, team members presented gifts to the President, including 
a U.S. Air Force Academy football jersey.]

    The President. You know, I sometimes don't have the best of timing. 
Tomorrow is the day in my annual rotation that I have to give the 
commencement address at the Naval Academy. [Laughter] So, if you'll 
forgive me, I think I'll start wearing this day after tomorrow on the 
golf course. [Laughter]
    You're great representatives of the United States. We're all proud 
of you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 6:10 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Gen. Michael E. Ryan, Chief of 
Staff, U.S. Air Force; and Lt. Gen. Tad Oelstrom, USAF, Superintendent, 
and Fisher DeBerry, Football Coach, U.S. Air Force Academy.
