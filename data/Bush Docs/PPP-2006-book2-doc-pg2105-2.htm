Remarks Prior to a Meeting With Business Leaders in Ho Chi Minh City, 
Vietnam
November 20, 2006

    Thank you all very much for--thank you very much for joining me and 
the Secretary of State.<Rice, Condoleezza<ls-thn-eq> I find it really 
interesting that my first meeting in Ho Chi Minh City is at the stock 
exchange, and I'm meeting with entrepreneurs, people who have taken a 
look at the markets in Vietnam and have decided that this is a good 
place to invest.
    I want to thank you all for coming to share some of your stories 
with me. I'm very interested in hearing what the opportunities are like 
and the obstacles you face

and how, perhaps, the United States can help foster the market economy 
that is growing here.
    I must tell you, I am, first of all, unbelievably grateful for the 
welcome that Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I have been received with 
here in Ho Chi Minh City; I've never seen as many people line the 
streets with such a friendly attitude. Secondly, when I read about the 
recent economic history of Vietnam, I am amazed at the size of the 
growth and the fact that are people are beginning to realize dreams. I 
recognize that some of you here at the table were born in Vietnam, came 
to the United States in the midseventies, and have decided to return. 
And I'm really interested in hearing what that has been like and the 
contrast in lifestyles and why you made the decisions you made.
    And I do want to hear from you all.

Note: The President spoke at 9:15 a.m. at the Ho Chi Minh City 
Securities Trading Center.
