Statement on House Action on Temporary Visas for Highly Skilled 
Immigrants
September 24, 1998

    I am pleased that the House of Representatives has moved quickly to 
pass a bipartisan compromise to address a shortage of skilled workers, 
while providing new training and protections for U.S. workers. To 
address that shortage and maintain America's competitive edge, we must 
give U.S. workers new opportunities to train and to learn new skills. 
This legislation helps us meet that challenge by providing up to $250 
million over 3 years in new funding to educate and train Americans for 
the jobs of the future.
    This compromise institutes new reforms to ensure that employers do 
not replace U.S. workers with temporary foreign workers and requires 
employers to recruit U.S. workers. In short, it contains new investments 
in training, tougher enforcement, and new protections for U.S. workers. 
I look forward to Congress sending me a bill that is consistent with our 
bipartisan agreement.
