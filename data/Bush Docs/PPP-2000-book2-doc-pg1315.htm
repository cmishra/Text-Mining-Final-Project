Statement on Expanding Access to Smoking Cessation Programs
June 27, 2000

    Today the Surgeon General<Satcher, David> is releasing 
updated guidelines, compiled by top public and private sector experts, 
to help more people overcome their tobacco addiction and to give health 
care professionals an important tool to help their patients quit using 
tobacco products. Tobacco addiction and related health disorders pose 
one of the greatest public health threats facing our Nation today. Over 
400,000 Americans die every year from tobacco related diseases--more 
than AIDS, illegal drugs, alcohol, fires, car accidents, murders, and 
suicides, combined.
    While more than 25 percent of U.S. adults smoke, studies show that 
70 percent of them would like to quit. To build on the new guidelines 
and progress we have already made to help Federal personnel stop 
smoking, today I am issuing an Executive memorandum directing all 
Federal departments and agencies to: encourage their employees to stop, 
or never start, smoking; provide information on proven smoking cessation 
treatments and practices; and describe assistance they can provide to 
help their personnel quit smoking. I am also directing the agencies to 
review their current tobacco cessation programs using the updated 
guidelines, and to report on their effectiveness and opportunities for 
enhancement to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.
    Finally, I urge Congress to enact my budget proposal to ensure that 
every State Medicaid program covers both prescription and 
nonprescription smoking cessation drugs--helping millions of low-income 
Americans gain access to medical treatments that would help them break 
their addiction to tobacco.

Note: This statement was embargoed for release until 4 p.m.
