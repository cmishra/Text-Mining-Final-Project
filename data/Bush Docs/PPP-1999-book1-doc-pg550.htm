Radio Remarks on Kick Butts Day
April 14, 1999

    Today, on Kick Butts Day, young people all across America are 
speaking out against teen tobacco use. These kids are right. It's 
tragic--and it's wrong--that every day 3,000 kids become regular 
smokers. So I urge Congress to stand with our kids and stand up to the 
tobacco companies who are targeting our children. I urge you to make 
sure the tobacco settlement funds are used to reduce youth smoking. It's 
time all of us worked together to give our children the healthy future 
they deserve.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 12:30 p.m. 
on April 9 in the administrative offices of Memorial Hall in 
Philadelphia, PA, for later broadcast. The transcript was released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary on April 14. These remarks were also 
made available on the White House Press Office Radio Actuality Line.
