Remarks Following a Briefing on Regional Tornado Damage in Lafayette, 
Tennessee
February 8, 2008

    Listen, I want to thank you for the briefing. People have got to 
understand here in the region that a lot of folks around America care 
for them now. And I'm here to listen, to determine, to make sure that 
the Federal response is compassionate and effective. I don't want people 
to think something is going to happen that's not going to happen. And 
therefore, when we say something is going to happen to help them get 
their feet back on the ground, it will happen.
    Secondly, I am here to thank the people that will provide the 
compassion for people who hurt. I notice we've got the Red Cross sitting 
over there. They're good responders. They respond to help people in 
need.
    Thirdly, I will make it clear to people here that I have no doubt in 
my mind this community will come back better than before. Macon County 
people are down-to-earth, hard-working, God-fearing people, who, if just 
given a little help, will come back stronger.
    And that's what--and so I want to thank you all for the briefing. 
Governor,<Bredesen, Philip N., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> again, thank you for being 
here. Appreciate the<Alexander, Lamar<ls-thn-eq> Senators<Corker, 
Robert<ls-thn-eq> and<Blackburn, Marsha<ls-thn-eq> Congressmen<Cooper, 
James Hayes Shofner<ls-thn-eq> joining<Gordon, Barton 
Jennings<ls-thn-eq> us too.

Note: The President spoke at 10:12 a.m. at the Lafayette Fire 
Department's Atwell & Scruggs Fire Station. In his remarks, he referred 
to Gov. Philip N. Bredesen, Jr., of Tennessee.
