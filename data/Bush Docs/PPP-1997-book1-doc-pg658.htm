Statement on the Resignation of Reed E. Hundt as Chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission
May 27, 1997

    It was with regret that I learned today that Reed Hundt, Chairman of 
the Federal Communications Commission, intends to leave before the end 
of his term, upon appointment of his successor.
    Chairman Hundt has been a strong and visionary leader of the FCC 
during this historic period in telecommunications policy. His steadfast 
commitment to the public interest and to bringing the benefits of 
competition to consumers is evident in his many accomplishments during 
his tenure, including the successful launching of spectrum auctions and 
the Commission's ontime implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 
1996. His expertise and counsel were indispensable in bringing home this 
year's World Trade Organization agreement on telecommunications, which 
will open markets abroad as never before.
    Perhaps most importantly, Chairman Hundt helped make the FCC an 
advocate for our children. He reinvigorated children's broadcasting, and 
he took pathbreaking steps to ensure that every classroom and library in 
America will be linked to the information superhighway.
    Chairman Hundt's leadership has opened opportunity to businesses 
here and abroad, while ensuring that all Americans share in the benefits 
of the telecommunications revolution. The Vice President and I are sorry 
to see him go and extend to him thanks on behalf of the American people 
for his excellent service.
