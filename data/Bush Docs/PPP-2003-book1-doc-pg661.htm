Statement on Congressional Action on Legislation To Strengthen 
AmeriCorps
June 19, 2003

    I commend Congress, particularly Senators Bond<Bond, 
Christopher> and Mikulski<Mikulski, Barbara A.> and 
Representatives Boehner<Boehner, John A.> and 
Hoekstra,<Hoekstra, Peter> for working with my administration 
and taking swift action to pass the ``Strengthen AmeriCorps Program 
Act.'' The bill establishes accounting guidelines for the Corporation 
for National and Community Service that will help put AmeriCorps on a 
sound financial footing. It is also the essential first step toward 
maximizing enrollment this year to benefit the nonprofit organizations 
that count on AmeriCorps members to offer help and hope to people in 
communities across the country.
    I hope Congress will continue to show strong support for my effort 
to help every American answer the call to volunteer service and act 
quickly to strengthen and expand national service by passing the 
``Citizen Service Act.''
