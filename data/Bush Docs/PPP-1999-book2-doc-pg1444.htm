Statement on the Death of Lane Kirkland<Kirkland, Joseph Lane>
August 14, 1999

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened by the passing of Lane Kirkland, 
one of the towering figures in the American labor movement. For nearly 
five decades, he was a guiding force for workplace fairness, dignity, 
and innovation, and a catalyst for international democracy.
    Lane led the AFL-CIO during 15 of the most challenging years in 
labor's history. With skill, determination, and unparalleled intellect, 
he reunited the major unions and reaffirmed labor's place at the table 
of American democracy. With his unflagging support of free trade 
unionism internationally, especially in Poland, he helped hasten the 
fall of the Iron Curtain while showing America that it is possible to 
stand up to communism abroad while standing up for working men and women 
here at home. From his days as a merchant marine during World War II to 
his work on the Board of Directors of the Institute of Peace, he was 
always ready and willing to serve his country. I valued his friendship, 
strong support, and keen advice. He was a great American, and he will be 
greatly missed.
    Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Irena,<Kirkland, 
Irena> and his family in this time of mourning.
