Statement on the Resignation of Mel R. Martinez<Martinez, Mel 
R.<ls-thn-eq> as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
December 9, 2003

    Mel Martinez is a good friend and an exceptional public servant. As 
a refugee from Cuba, Mel came to America in search of freedom and 
opportunity as one of the many young children sent by their parents as 
part of a Catholic relief program known as Pedro Pan. As Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development, he has worked tirelessly to help every 
American realize the promise of our country for themselves and their 
families. I appreciate the energy, optimism, and compassion he brought 
to my administration. I thank him for serving our Nation so selflessly, 
and Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish Mel, his wife, 
Kitty,<Martinez, Kitty<ls-thn-eq> and their family well.
