Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Cyprus
May 26, 1998

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you this report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the 
Cyprus question covering the period February 1, 1998, to March 31, 1998. 
The previous submission covered events during December 1997 to January 
1998.
    U.S. efforts on the Cyprus issue intensified following the February 
15 completion of the Cypriot Presidential elections. In my letter of 
congratulations to President Clerides<Clerides, Glafcos<ls-thn-eq> on 
his reelection, I reiterated U.S. support for the U.N. process to 
achieve a settlement based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation and 
expressed the hope that both parties would bring new ideas and 
creativity to the table. A parallel message was sent to Turkish Cypriot 
leader Denktash.<Denktash, Rauf<ls-thn-eq> Special Cyprus Coordinator 
Thomas J. Miller<Miller, Thomas J.<ls-thn-eq> visited the region March 
7-13 to consult with the leaders of both Cypriot communities, as well as 
Turkish and Greek officials, on how best to address the core issues of 
the dispute. The Greek Cypriot decision to purchase S-300 anti-aircraft 
missiles and the Turkish Cypriot suspension of bicommunal contacts 
continued to be of concern.
    It is also important to note that U.S. investigators recovered 
remains from northern Cyprus that were identified as those of Andrew 
Kassapis,<Kassapis, Andreas<ls-thn-eq> a Cypriot-American who 
disappeared during the 1974 conflict. Under separate cover, as required 
by law, I have transmitted a full accounting of the investigation 
conducted by the U.S. Government on the fate of Mr. Kassapis and four 
other U.S. citizens missing from Cyprus. I hope that this report will 
serve as a catalyst for progress on other cases of Greek and Turkish 
Cypriot persons missing as a result of intercommunal violence.
    Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
