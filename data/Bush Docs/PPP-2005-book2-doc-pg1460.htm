Remarks to Reporters in New Orleans, Louisiana
September 20, 2005

Hurricane Katrina Recovery

    The President. I want to thank the folks here at the Folger plant 
for inviting us to come say hello. The reason I've come with the 
mayor<Nagin, C. Ray<ls-thn-eq> and with Admiral Allen<Allen, Thad 
W.<ls-thn-eq> is because I want the people to know that

[[Page 1461]]

there's progress being made in this part of the world. We've got some 
people working here because of the ingenuity of the plant managers. 
Behind me you see temporary housing where this company has provided 
housing for the folks who work here.
    Mayor C. Ray Nagin.<Nagin, C. Ray<ls-thn-eq> FEMA helped.
    The President. And FEMA helped with that. And what you're beginning 
to see is a revitalized economy. Progress is being made toward meeting 
the mayor's<Nagin, C. Ray<ls-thn-eq> vision of a--and my vision and 
everybody's vision involved with this of a vibrant New Orleans and 
surrounding parishes.
    The other thing, I've just come from a briefing about Hurricane 
Rita--or Storm Rita, now a category 2 hurricane--and we were watching 
very closely, of course, its track. All up and down this coastline, 
people are now preparing for what is anticipated to be yet another 
significant storm. Admiral Allen<Allen, Thad W.<ls-thn-eq> is going to 
stay in charge of the Louisiana/Mississippi area. We've got another 
admiral who is now being stationed in Texas to coordinate the relief 
response. We've got military assets that are being taken out of the New 
Orleans area, out of harm's way, and have come back in behind the storm, 
to follow up where it's needed.
    I've been in touch with the Governor of Texas.<Perry, 
Rick<ls-thn-eq> I've been briefed on the planning for what we pray is 
not a devastating storm--but there's one coming. And I appreciate the 
mayor<Nagin, C. Ray<ls-thn-eq> recognizing that, and he made a wise 
decision to say to people, ``Be cautious about returning here because a 
flood--a rain of any amount could cause these levees to break again.''
    But progress is being made. As I said in Mississippi, I was pleased 
to see the progress being made on the ground. There's still a lot of 
work, but they're making progress. And they're making progress here in 
New Orleans too. Again, we've got a lot of work to do, but people are 
determined to get the job done.
    Anyway, I want to thank you for having me. Thanks for having me 
back. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 3:40 p.m. at the Folgers Coffee plant. In 
his remarks, he referred to Mayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans, LA; Vice 
Adm. Thad W. Allen, USCG, U.S. Coast Guard Chief of Staff; Rear Adm. 
Larry L. Hereth, USCG, commander, Fifth Coast Guard District; and Gov. 
Rick Perry of Texas.
