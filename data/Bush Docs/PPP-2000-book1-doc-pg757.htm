Statement on Russian State Duma Action on the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
April 21, 2000

    I am pleased that the Russian State Duma today approved the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). I look forward to prompt 
action on the CTBT by the Federation Council, which also approved the 
START II Treaty earlier this week.
    More than 150 countries have signed the CTBT so far, agreeing to 
stop all nuclear explosive testing. Ratification of the CTBT by Russia 
would mean that 30 of the 44 states whose ratification is required for 
entry into force have now approved this historic agreement, including 
many U.S. friends and allies. Approval of the CTBT by Russia--as well as 
the recent approvals by Chile, Bangladesh, and Turkey--renews momentum 
for the international effort to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and 
promote disarmament around the world.
    I congratulate President-elect Putin<Putin, Vladimir<ls-thn-eq> and 
his government, members of the State Duma, and Russian citizens who 
together worked to achieve this important step toward a safer future.
