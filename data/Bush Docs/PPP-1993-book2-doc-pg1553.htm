Statement on the Situation in Russia
September 21, 1993

    From the beginning of my administration, I have given my full 
backing to the historic process of political and economic reform now 
underway in Russia. I remain convinced that democratic reforms and the 
transition to a market economy hold the best hope for a better future 
for the people of Russia.
    The actions announced today by President Yeltsin in his address to 
the Russian people underscore the complexity of the reform process that 
he is leading. There is no question that President Yeltsin acted in 
response to a constitutional crisis that had reached a critical impasse 
and had paralyzed the political process.
    As the democratically elected leader of Russia, President Yeltsin 
has chosen to allow the people of Russia themselves to resolve this 
impasse. I believe that the path to elections for a new legislature is 
ultimately consistent with the democratic and reform course that he has 
charted.
    I called President Yeltsin this afternoon to seek assurances that 
the difficult choices that he faces will be made in a way that ensures 
peace, stability, and an open political process this autumn. He told me 
that it is of the utmost importance that the elections he has called be 
organized and held on a democratic and free

basis.
    In a democracy, the people should finally decide the issues that are 
at the heart of political and social debate. President Yeltsin has made 
this choice, and I support him fully. I have confidence in the abiding 
wisdom of the Russian people to make the right decision regarding their 
own future.
