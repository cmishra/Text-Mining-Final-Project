Statement on Senate Action To Block Votes on Judicial Nominations
July 22, 2004

    Today a minority of Senators employed filibuster tactics to bar 
confirmation votes on three excellent judicial nominees from Michigan to 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit--Judge Richard 
Griffin,<Griffin, Richard A.<ls-thn-eq> Judge David McKeague,<McKeague, 
David W.<ls-thn-eq> and Judge Henry Saad.<Saad, Henry W.<ls-thn-eq> Each 
of these nominees is eminently qualified, has the support of a majority 
of Senators, and would be confirmed if given an up-or-down vote.
    These filibuster tactics are shameful and inconsistent with the 
Senate's constitutional obligation. All three<Saad, Henry W.<ls-thn-eq> 
of<McKeague, David W.<ls-thn-eq> these<Griffin, Richard A.<ls-thn-eq> 
fine men are distinguished jurists. Together they have more than three 
decades of experience on the Michigan State and Federal courts. All 
three have been rated either well-qualified or qualified by the American 
Bar Association. The vacancies these judges have been nominated to fill 
have been designated judicial emergencies by the Judicial Conference of 
the United States. Yet all three nominees have been waiting more than 2 
years for an up-or-down vote in the Senate. By blocking votes on these 
nominations, a minority of Senators is continuing a crisis that has 
delayed the administration of justice in the Sixth Circuit.
    Prior to this Congress, the filibuster had never been used to block 
the confirmation of a judicial nominee. But in recent months, the use of 
this obstructionist tactic by some Democrats has become commonplace. 
With today's action, 10 appeals court nominees have now been 
filibustered.
    The Senate minority's unfair treatment of these nominees 
demonstrates the breakdown in the judicial confirmation process. More 
than 18 months ago, I proposed a plan that would ensure that judicial 
nominees receive timely hearings and up-or-down votes no matter who is 
President or which party controls the Senate. I again urge the Senate--
Republicans and Democrats alike--to put an end to the partisan politics 
of the past and ensure judicial nominees are given the timely up-or-down 
votes they deserve. The Senate owes it to these fine men and women and 
to the American people.
