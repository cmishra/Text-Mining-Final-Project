April 29, 2005

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with title I of the District of Columbia Appropriations 
Act, 2005, Public Law 108-335, I am notifying the Congress of the 
proposed use of $2,471,588 provided in title I under the heading 
``Federal Payment for Emergency Planning and Security Costs in the 
District of Columbia.'' This will reimburse the District for the costs 
of public safety expenses related to security events and responses to 
terrorist threats.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
