Nomination for Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration
August 10, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate small 
business entrepreneur Cassandra Pulley Robinson as Deputy Administrator 
at the Small Business Administration.
    ``As someone who has started a business herself, Cassandra Robinson 
understands the challenges new business people face. I am confident she 
will do an excellent job assisting Erskine Bowles at the head of SBA as 
we work to better opportunities for small and growing businesses,'' the 
President said.

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
