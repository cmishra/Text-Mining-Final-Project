Statement on the Agreement by the Government of Germany To Compensate 
Victims of Nazi Slave and Forced Labor
July 17, 2000

    In Berlin today the German Government and German companies signed an 
agreement that will lead to payments to victims of Nazi slave and forced 
labor. This important and generous act will bring comfort and some 
measure of justice to surviving victims of the Nazi era. It is a fitting 
capstone to the 20th century and a cornerstone for a 21st century of 
peace and tolerance. I welcome the signing of this historic agreement 
and commend the German Government and companies for their responsibility 
and courage. I also applaud Chancellor Schroeder,<Schroeder, 
Gerhard> Deputy Treasury Secretary Eizenstat,<Eizenstat, 
Stuart E.> and German negotiator Lambsdorff<Lambsdorff, Otto 
Graf> for their leadership and perseverance in bringing us to 
this point.
