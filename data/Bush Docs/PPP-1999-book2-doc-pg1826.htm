Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Significant Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia
October 19, 1999

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that 
the emergency declared with respect to significant narcotics traffickers 
centered in Colombia is to continue in effect for 1 year beyond October 
21, 1999.
    The circumstances that led to the declaration on October 21, 1995, 
of a national emergency have not been resolved. The actions of 
significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to pose 
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States and to cause unparalleled 
violence, corruption, and harm in the United States and abroad. For 
these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in 
force the broad authorities necessary to maintain economic pressure on 
significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia by blocking their 
property subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and by 
depriving them of access to the United States market and financial 
system.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

October 19, 1999.

Note: The notice of October 19 is listed in Appendix D at the end of the 
volume.
