Statement on Congressional Action on Emergency Wartime Supplemental 
Appropriations Legislation
April 4, 2003

war in Iraq, to respond to increased homeland security needs, and to 
strengthen the capabilities of our allies. As the bills go to 
conference, we will seek to combine the best elements of the House and 
Senate bills to help ensure that the final legislation includes both the 
funding and flexibility necessary to respond quickly and effectively to 
any changing needs at home and abroad.
