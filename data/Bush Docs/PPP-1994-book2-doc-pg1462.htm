Remarks on Anticrime Legislation
August 12, 1994

    Ladies and gentlemen, last night when 225 Members of Congress voted 
with the NRA and the Republican congressional leadership, under enormous 
pressure, they decided that their political security was more important 
than the personal security of the American people. They said no to 
100,000 police on the street, no to getting guns and kids off the 
street, no to protecting our police forces and our citizens against 
gangs with assault weapons, no to giving our kids some things to say yes 
to as well as something to say no to, no to ``three strikes and you're 
out'' and the toughest punishment laws ever passed by the United States 
Congress.
    We are going out now, the Cabinet, mayors of both parties, citizens 
of both parties all across this country, to say that this crime bill 
cannot die. Congress has an obligation to the American people that goes 
way beyond politics and way beyond party. The American people have said 
over and over this is their first concern. If we can't meet this 
concern, there is something

badly wrong in Washington. And we are going today, starting now, to the 
National Association of Police Officers conference to carry this battle 
back. We are going to fight and fight and fight until we win this battle 
for the American people.
    Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 8:12 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House, prior to his departure for Minneapolis, MN.
