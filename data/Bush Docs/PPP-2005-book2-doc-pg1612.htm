Statement Announcing the Withdrawal of the Nomination of Harriet E. 
Miers<Miers, Harriet E.<ls-thn-eq> To Be an Associate Justice of the 
United States Supreme Court
October 27, 2005

    Today I have reluctantly accepted Harriet Miers's decision to 
withdraw her nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States.
    I nominated Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court because of her 
extraordinary legal experience, her character, and her conservative 
judicial philosophy. Throughout her career, she has gained the respect 
and admiration of her fellow attorneys. She has earned a reputation for 
fairness and total integrity. She has been a leader and a pioneer in the 
American legal profession. She has worked in important positions in 
State and local government and in the bar. And for the last 5 years, she 
has served with distinction and honor in critical positions in the 
executive branch.
    I understand and share her concern, however, about the current state 
of the Supreme Court confirmation process. It is clear that Senators 
would not be satisfied until they gained access to internal documents 
concerning advice provided during her tenure at the White House--
disclosures that would undermine a President's ability to receive candid 
counsel. Harriet Miers's decision demonstrates her deep respect for this 
essential aspect of the Constitutional separation of powers--and 
confirms my deep respect and admiration for her.
    I am grateful for Harriet Miers's friendship and devotion to our 
country. And I am honored that she will continue to serve our Nation as 
White House Counsel.
    My responsibility to fill this vacancy remains. I will do so in a 
timely manner.
