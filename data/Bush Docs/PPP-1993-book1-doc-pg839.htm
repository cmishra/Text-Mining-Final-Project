Statement on Nuclear Nonproliferation Talks With North Korea
June 11, 1993

    I welcome the successful outcome of talks between the United States 
and North Korea today in New York, which have led to the agreement of 
North Korea to suspend its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
This agreement is a first but vital step towards ensuring North Korean 
participation in a strong international nonproliferation regime, a goal 
that will benefit all nations.
    Preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons is one of the 
highest priorities of my administration, and we will continue to press 
the North Koreans strongly to comply fully with international standards 
and to move towards the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
    The American negotiating team, under the direction of Assistant 
Secretary Robert Gallucci, achieved this important step not only on 
behalf of the people of the United States but on behalf of the entire 
international community.

Note: The statement referred to Robert Gallucci, Assistant Secretary of 
State for Politico-Military Affairs.
