Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with the authorities relating to official immunity in the 
interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking, (Public 
Law 107-108, 22 U.S.C. 2291-4), and in order to keep the Congress fully 
informed, I am providing a report prepared by my Administration. This 
report includes matters relating to the interdiction of aircraft engaged 
in illicit drug trafficking.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on
