Message to the Congress Transmitting the Blueprint for the Program To 
Rally the Armies of Compassion
January 30, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:
    Enclosed please find the blueprint for my program to ``Rally the 
Armies of Compassion.'' I look forward to working with the Congress to 
pass reforms to support the heroic works of faith-based and community 
groups across America.

                                                          George W. Bush

The White House,
