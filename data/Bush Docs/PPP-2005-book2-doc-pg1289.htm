Statement on the Death of King Fahd bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud<King Fahd 
bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud<ls-thn-eq> of Saudi Arabia
August 1, 2005

    I was deeply saddened to learn today of the death of King Fahd bin 
Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and King of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. King Fahd was a man of wisdom and a leader who 
commanded respect throughout the entire world. He was a friend and 
strong ally of the United States for decades. As King, he had warm 
friendships with American Presidents. I send my condolences and those of 
the American people to King Abdallah,<King Abdallah bin Abd al-Aziz Al 
Saud<ls-thn-eq> to the late King Fahd's family, and to the Saudi people 
on the passing of this historic figure. May God bless him.
