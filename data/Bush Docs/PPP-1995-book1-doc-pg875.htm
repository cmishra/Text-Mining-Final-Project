Statement on the Retirement of Lane Kirkland
June 12, 1995

    American workers and workers around the world owe a tremendous debt 
of gratitude to Lane Kirkland. For nearly five decades, he has been a 
catalyst for international democracy and a guiding force for workplace 
fairness, dignity, and innovation.
    His record of achievement rivals the great labor leaders that came 
before him, and his ideas and accomplishments will benefit working 
families for generations to come. He served with distinction during some 
of the toughest times for American workers and brought creativity, a 
laser-like determination, true grit, and an unparalleled intellect to 
his job as president of the AFL-CIO.
    Hillary and I wish him the very best for the future and will always 
be grateful for his strong support, keen advice, and valued friendship.
