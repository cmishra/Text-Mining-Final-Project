Exchange With Reporters at a Meeting With Close-Up Foundation Students 
From Arkansas
February 25, 1993

Bosnia

    Q. Mr. President, do you care to say any more about the operational 
details of the airlift?
    The President. No.
    Q. How about explaining to the American people why it's an important 
issue for the United States to undertake?
    The President. What?
    Q. Why is it an important mission for us to put people at risk for 
that?
    The President. Well, I'll say again, General Powell believes the 
risk is quite limited and not appreciably more than many training 
flights that our airmen do every year. It's important because we believe 
if--number one, there are a lot of people over there who need the food 
and can't get it by road, so it's a humanitarian gesture. And secondly, 
we think if we do it, we will be able to create a somewhat better 
climate for negotiations, and we're pushing to try to have good-faith 
negotiations. So we're hoping it works out.

Note: The President spoke at 4:01 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House.
