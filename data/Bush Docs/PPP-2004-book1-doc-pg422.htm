Telephone Remarks to the South Boston Saint Patrick's Day Breakfast
March 21, 2004

    The President. Senator, this would be your President calling.
    State Senator Jack Hart.<Hart, Jack<ls-thn-eq> President Bush, 
President Bush is on the line. How about a nice round of applause for 
President Bush? Happy Saint Patrick's Day. What an honor.
    The President. Yes, same to you, Jack. Thanks for letting me call 
in. I appreciate you taking my call.
    Senator Hart.<Hart, Jack<ls-thn-eq> Any time, Mr. President, we'll 
take your call any time, for crying out loud.
    The President. Well, I'm proud of that. Listen, I want to thank 
Father Casey.<Casey, Robert E.<ls-thn-eq> I presume he's got quite a few 
souls to save there in that crowd. [Laughter]
    Senator Hart.<Hart, Jack<ls-thn-eq> There's quite a few Democratic 
souls to save in this hall, Mr. President.
    The President. I know you've got one--you invited at least one 
Republican, and that's my friend the Governor.<Romney, Mitt<ls-thn-eq>
    Senator Hart.<Hart, Jack<ls-thn-eq> Yes, yes, he's here. Mitt Romney 
is here. We were going to ask you, Mr. President, do you need a 
runningmate? [Laughter]
    The President. Wait a minute.
    Senator Hart. We like Dick Cheney and all, but we'd like for you to 
take the Governor to Washington, DC. [Laughter]
    The President. Look, you're lucky to have the guy.<Romney, 
Mitt<ls-thn-eq> Here's the way I like to put it about Massachusetts: I 
know there's a lot of talk about a Massachusetts politician who has his 
eye on the Presidency. But tell Mitt it's not open until 2008. 
[Laughter]
    Senator Hart.<Hart, Jack<ls-thn-eq> Oh, you're talking about--you 
had me stumped for a second there. You're talking about Senator Kerry, 
of course.
    The President. Oh, no, no.
    Senator Hart.<Hart, Jack<ls-thn-eq> Oh, my goodness.
    The President. You mean the--well, never mind. [Laughter]
    I want to thank the Lieutenant Governor.<Healey, Kerry<ls-thn-eq> I 
want to thank the speaker<Finneran, Thomas M.<ls-thn-eq> and the senate 
president.<Travaglini, Robert E.<ls-thn-eq> I miss my days as being the 
Governor. I loved dealing with our Lieutenant Governor and speaker and 
members of the statehouse and the State senate. And I wish you all the 
very best. I know you're struggling with some big issues. But these are 
good, decent folks working for the people of Massachusetts to get some 
things done, and I appreciate, Jack,<Hart, Jack<ls-thn-eq> the spirit of 
this lunch.
    Senator Hart.<Hart, Jack<ls-thn-eq> Well, thank you very much. We 
are certainly honored that you called, and we respect the job that 
you're doing. We pray for you every day, Mr. President. You're a good 
man, and we just wanted to wish you a very, very happy Saint Patrick's 
Day.
    The President. Same to you, sir, and I wish everybody a happy Saint 
Patrick's Day as well. God bless, everybody. God bless our great Nation.

Note: The President spoke at 10:25 a.m. from the Residence at the White 
House to breakfast participants meeting in Boston, MA. In his remarks, 
he referred to Rev. Robert E. Casey, pastor, Saint Brigid's Catholic 
Church, Boston, MA; Gov. Mitt Romney and Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey of 
Massachusetts; Thomas M. Finneran, speaker, Massachusetts State House of 
Representatives; and
