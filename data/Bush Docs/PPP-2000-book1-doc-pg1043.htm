Statement on Federal Compensation for Losses Incurred in the
Bandelier National Monument Fire
May 26, 2000

    This administration is committed to ensuring that all those who have 
been affected by the fire that began at Bandelier National* Monument are 
fully compensated for their losses. At this time, we are working with 
the New Mexico delegation to craft legislation that would govern Federal 
compensation and make available the funds needed to pay for this 
legislation. We are committed to working with the Congress to ensure 
that this matter is addressed as promptly as possible.
