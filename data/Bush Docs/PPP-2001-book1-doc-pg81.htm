Remarks on the Situation in the Middle East
February 14, 2001



    Good morning. I strongly condemn the terrible act of violence in 
Israel this morning. I have called Prime Minister Barak<Barak, 
Ehud<ls-thn-eq> to express my condolences to the families of the people 
killed and to all the Israeli people.
    As I told the Prime Minister,<Barak, Ehud<ls-thn-eq> the tragic 
cycle of violent action and reaction between Israel and the 
Palestinians, particularly the escalation this week, needs to stop. I'm 
urging all parties to do their utmost to end the violence.
    We will continue to work with all parties to try to restore calm to 
the region.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 8:55 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House, prior to his departure for Charleston, WV. In his remarks, he 
referred to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel.
