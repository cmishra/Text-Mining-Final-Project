Statement on Signing the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug 
Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006
November 10, 2005

    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 2744, the ``Agriculture, Rural 
Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act, 2006.'' The Act funds important agriculture, food 
safety, natural resource and other programs of the Federal Government.
    The executive branch shall construe certain provisions of the Act 
that purport to require congressional committee approval for the 
execution of a law as calling solely for notification, as any other 
construction would be inconsistent with the principles enunciated by the 
Supreme Court of the United States in INS v. Chadha. These provisions 
include sections 705, 716, and 732, and language under the heading 
``Food and Drug Administration, Salaries and
Expenses.''
    The executive branch shall construe section 715, which purports to 
regulate thetransmission of information by employees at the Department 
of Agriculture, in a manner consistent with the President's 
constitutional authority to faithfully execute the laws and to supervise 
the unitary executive branch.
    The executive branch shall construe section 719, which purports to 
regulate the transmittal of legislative recommendations by executive 
branch officials to the Congress, in a manner consistent with the 
President's constitutional authority to recommend such measures to the 
Congress as he deems necessary and expedient.
    Several provisions of the bill relate to race or ethnicity. The 
executive branch shall construe such provisions in a manner consistent 
with the requirement that the Federal Government afford equal protection 
of the laws under the Due Process
