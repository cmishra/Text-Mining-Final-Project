Statement on Violent Crime
May 5, 1996

    For 5 straight years before I took office, violent crime increased 
in America. Because of our tough and smart decisions to put more cops on 
the street and get kids, guns, and drugs off the street, we are now 
beginning to reverse the trend in violent crime.
