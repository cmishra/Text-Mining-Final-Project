Statement on the No Child Left Behind Act
April 22, 2008

    Today Education Secretary Margaret Spellings<Spellings, 
Margaret<ls-thn-eq> took an important step towards strengthening and 
improving the No Child Left Behind Act. In the 6 years since its 
enactment, this law has delivered real results for students across the 
country. Students are achieving record math and reading scores, and 
African American and Hispanic students are making significant progress, 
posting alltime high scores in a number of categories.
    No Child Left Behind was a bipartisan achievement. Unfortunately, at 
this time, Congress hasn't made noteworthy progress toward strengthening 
the law. In January, I indicated that the Secretary<Spellings, 
Margaret<ls-thn-eq> should move forward on reforms she can undertake 
administratively if Congress fails to act.
    Secretary Spellings's<Spellings, Margaret<ls-thn-eq> announced 
package of regulations and pilot programs will address the dropout 
crisis in America, strengthen accountability, improve our lowest 
performing schools, and ensure that more students get access to high-
quality tutoring. Her actions build on a series of administrative steps 
we've taken to provide additional flexibility to strengthen and improve 
the law to ensure continued progress toward the goal of every child 
reading and doing math at grade level by 2014.
