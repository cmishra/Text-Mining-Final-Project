Statement on the 40th Anniversary of the Death of Martin Luther King, 
Jr.
April 4, 2008

    Forty years ago today, America was robbed of one of history's most 
consequential advocates for equality and civil rights. On this day, we 
mourn the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and we celebrate 
his powerful and eloquent message of justice and hope.
    Dr. King was a man of courage and vision. He understood that love 
and compassion will always triumph over bitterness and hatred. His words 
and deeds inspired Americans of all races to confront prejudice and to 
work to ensure that our country is a land of opportunity for all its men 
and women.
    We have made progress on Dr. King's dream, yet the struggle is not 
over. Ensuring freedom and equality for all Americans remains one of our 
most important responsibilities. As we reflect upon Dr. King's life and 
legacy, we must recommit ourselves to following his lasting example of 
service to others.
