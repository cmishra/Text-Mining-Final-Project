Statement on Congressional Action on Public Health Security and 
Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Legislation
May 23, 2002

    I applaud members of both parties, including Congressmen 
Tauzin<Tauzin, W.J. ``Billy''> and Dingell<Dingell, John 
D.> and Senators Kennedy,<Kennedy, Edward M.> 
Gregg,<Gregg, Judd> and Frist,<Frist, Bill> for 
acting on my proposals to protect Americans against bioterrorism. This 
legislation strengthens food safety and security, improves the ability 
of Federal, State, and local authorities to coordinate their response to 
possible bioterrorist attacks, and enhances surveillance and security 
over dangerous biological agents.
    I commend the House and Senate for their hard work and look forward 
to signing this important bipartisan legislation into law.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 3448, the proposed ``Public Health 
Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.''
