Message on the Observance of Id al-Fitr
March 9, 1994

    My family and I wish to extend our personal greetings to all in the 
Muslim Community celebrating the Id al-Fitr.
    This week marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims in 
the United States and around the world. A time for rejoicing and 
celebrating, this Id in particular also reminds us of our shared 
responsibility to work for a better future for all the world's people--
especially in the wake of the Hebron massacre. Let

us all rededicate ourselves to realizing this goal in the Middle East 
and around the world.
    In the United States, this is an occasion for us to reflect with 
pride on the achievements of Muslim Americans and to take satisfaction 
in the historic and constructive relations which we have had with Muslim 
countries around the world. Central tenets of the Ramadan fast that is 
now ending are responsibility for those less fortunate and 
rededication--individual by individual--to the creation of a better 
community and a better world. These are ideals that stand as beacons for 
people of all faiths everywhere.
    On this occasion, let me convey to you my very best wishes with the 
traditional greeting: May peace be with you and may God grant you health 
and prosperity now and in the years ahead.
