Message on the Observance of Easter 2008
March 21, 2008

    ``I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will 
live, even though he dies.''

                                                              John 11:25

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send greetings to all those 
celebrating the joyful holiday of Easter.
    The Resurrection of Jesus Christ reminds people around the world of 
the presence of a faithful God who offers a love more powerful than 
death. Easter commemorates our Savior's triumph over sin, and we take 
joy in spending this special time with family and friends and reflecting 
on the many blessings that fill our lives. During this season of 
renewal, let us come together and give thanks to the Almighty who made 
us in His image and redeemed us in His love.
    On this glorious day, we remember our brave men and women in uniform 
who are separated from their families by great distances. We pray for 
their safety and strength, and we honor those who gave their lives to 
advance peace and secure liberty across the globe.
    Happy Easter. May God bless you, and may God bless our great Nation.

                                                          George W. Bush
