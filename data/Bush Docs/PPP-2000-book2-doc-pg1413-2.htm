Statement on Environmental Protection Agency Action To Strengthen Water 
Quality Protections
July 11, 2000

    Today's action by the Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen 
water quality protections nationwide is a critical, commonsense step to 
ensure clean, safe water for all Americans. While we have made 
tremendous progress over the past quarter-century, too many of our 
rivers, lakes, and bays are still too polluted for fishing or swimming. 
With the new strategy we launch today, we will work in close partnership 
with States and communities to tackle our remaining pollution threats 
and complete the job of cleaning up America's precious waterways.
