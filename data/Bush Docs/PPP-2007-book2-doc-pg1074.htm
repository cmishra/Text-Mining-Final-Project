Statement on Representative J. Dennis Hastert's<Hastert, J. 
Dennis<ls-thn-eq> Decision Not To Seek Reelection
August 17, 2007

    It has been a great pleasure forging a close friendship and working 
relationship with Denny Hastert. He is a good and decent man, and he was 
a strong and effective Speaker. After teaching government and history at 
Yorkville High School in Illinois, Denny began making history serving in 
the Illinois House of Representatives and the United States House of 
Representatives. During his two decades in Congress, Denny rose through 
the ranks as a hard-working Member whom colleagues on both sides came to 
admire, trust, and respect and became the longest serving Republican 
Speaker in history. Drawing on lessons he learned as a coach, he 
successfully guided Members of Congress to work together to enact 
legislation that has improved the lives of Americans. He led Congress to 
reduce taxes, improve education, strengthen Medicare, bolster our 
national defense, and support our troops. Our Nation is stronger because 
of his service.
    I am indebted to Denny for his candid advice and strong support, and 
I look forward to working with him throughout the remainder of the 110th 
Congress. As my good friend prepares to move on to the next phase of his 
life, he has my gratitude for his distinguished service. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I wish Denny, Jean,<Hastert, Jean<ls-thn-eq> and 
their entire family all the best.
