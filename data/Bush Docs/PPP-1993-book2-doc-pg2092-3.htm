Message to President Cesar Gaviria of Colombia on the Death of Pablo 
Escobar
December 2, 1993

Dear Mr. President:
    I just learned of the success of your long struggle to bring Pablo 
Escobar to justice. I want to offer my congratulations to you and the 
Colombian security forces for your courageous and effective work in this 
case. Hundreds of Colombians, brave police officers and innocent people, 
lost their lives as a result of Escobar's terrorism. Your work honors 
the memory of all of these victims. We are proud of the firm stand you 
have taken, and I pledge to you our continued cooperation in our joint 
efforts to combat drug trafficking.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton
