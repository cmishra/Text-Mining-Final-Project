Message to the Congress Transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal 
Year 2004 Budget Request
July 9, 2003

To the Congress of the United States:
    Consistent with my constitutional authority and sections 202(c) and 
(e) of the District of Columbia Financial Management and Responsibility 
Assistance Act of 1995 and section 446 of the District of Columbia Self-
Governmental Reorganization Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting 
the District of Columbia's Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Request Act.
    The proposed Fiscal Year 2004 Budget Request Act reflects the major 
programmatic objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of 
Columbia. For Fiscal Year 2004, the District estimates total revenues 
and expenditures of $5.6 billion.

                                                          George W. Bush

The White House,

July 9, 2003.
