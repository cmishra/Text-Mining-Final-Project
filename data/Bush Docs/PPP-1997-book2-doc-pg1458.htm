Statement on Signing Legislation Conferring Honorary Veteran Status on 
Bob Hope
October 30, 1997

    Today I signed into law H.J. Res. 75, which confers upon Bob Hope 
the status of honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces and extends to 
him the gratitude of the American people for his lifetime of 
accomplishments and service on behalf of our men and women in uniform.
    Bob Hope is a great American whose life has defined patriotism and 
service. In times of war and peace, good times and bad, he entertained 
our troops and brought to them a familiar and comforting sense of home 
while they defended our nation's interests around the world. Bob Hope 
richly deserves this unique honor, and I am proud to be able to sign 
this measure into law.

Note: H.J. Res. 75, approved October 30, was assigned Public Law No. 
105-67.
