Remarks Prior to a Meeting With the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Combatant 
Commanders
January 29, 2008

    Mr. Secretary,<England, Gordon<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much. Mr. 
Chairman,<Mullen, Michael G.<ls-thn-eq> we're glad you're here. The Vice 
President<Cheney, Dick<ls-thn-eq> and I welcome you all. One of the 
highlights of my year is to meet with combatant commanders and the Joint 
Chiefs. We'll have a visit here in the Cabinet Room, talking about the 
war on terror

and the ideological struggle that we're engaged in. We'll talk about our 
common desire to protect America and how best to do so. And then we're 
going to have dinner with your spouses, and Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
and I are really looking forward to having you upstairs.
    I love our military, and the reason I do is because the character of 
those who wear our uniform, whether they be the general or the private, 
is remarkable. We're a nation that has produced people who are willing 
to volunteer in the face of danger, thank goodness. And as a result, we 
are a nation in the lead in helping defend this world against extremists 
who murder the innocent to achieve an ideological objective.
    And our military is compassionate as well. I'm looking forward to 
the stories from our commanders who will share with us the great 
compassion of our soldiers, whether it's to provide relief from a 
disaster or to help some child recognize the beauty of going to school.
    And so I want to thank you for coming and thank you for serving, and 
I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 5:11 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
