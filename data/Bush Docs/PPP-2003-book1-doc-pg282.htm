Remarks Following a Cabinet Meeting
March 20, 2003

    I called my Cabinet together to review our strategies to make the 
world more peaceful, to make our country more secure, to make the lives 
of our citizens as healthy and as prosperous as possible.
    We heard from Secretary Rumsfeld,<Rumsfeld, Donald H.> who 
briefed us on the early stages of the war. There's no question we've 
sent the finest of our citizens into harm's way. They perform with great 
skill and great bravery. We thank them. We thank their loved ones. We 
appreciate their sacrifice.
    We heard from Secretary Powell,<Powell, Colin L.> who 
briefed us on the ever-growing coalition of the willing, nations who 
support our deep desire for peace and freedom. Over 40 nations now 
support our efforts. We are grateful for their determination. We 
appreciate their vision, and we welcome their support.
    As well, we discussed the need to make sure we have plans in place 
to encourage economic vitality and growth. We will continue to push for 
a Medicare system that

is compassionate for our seniors. We care deeply about the fact that 
some children in our society can't read. We want the best of education 
for every citizen in America.
    This Cabinet is confident about the future of our country. We're 
confident we can achieve our objectives. I'm grateful for their service 
to their country.
    Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 2:53 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House.
