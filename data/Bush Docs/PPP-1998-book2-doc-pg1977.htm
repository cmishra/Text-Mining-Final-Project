Statement on the Russia-United States Agreement on Food Aid
November 4, 1998

    I am pleased to announce that a U.S. team will begin today to 
finalize an agreement with the Government of Russia on a program to 
provide at least 3.1 million metric tons of food. This program will help 
sustain Russians through a serious food shortage this winter as well as 
their country's continuing economic distress. In addition, this 
agreement will bolster American farmers and ranchers who have been hit 
hard by an agricultural crisis here. We will be prepared to consider 
additional assistance if necessary.
    The program is being developed under the auspices of the binational 
commission chaired by Vice President Gore and Prime Minister Primakov. 
Our negotiating team will work with their Russian counterparts to ensure 
that our assistance is distributed properly and exempted from taxes and 
customs duties. These are key elements to a successful program.
