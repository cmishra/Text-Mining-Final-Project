Statement on the Elections in South Africa
April 21, 2004

    I congratulate President Thabo Mbeki<Mbeki, Thabo<ls-thn-eq> on 
South Africa's third democratic national election and his party's 
election victory. The United States also congratulates the people of 
South Africa as they celebrate on April 27 the 10th anniversary of 
freedom and democracy replacing apartheid rule. The United States 
welcomes the peaceful exercise of democracy demonstrated by the 
Government and people of the Republic of South Africa. All competing 
parties deserve recognition for playing their role in a multiparty 
democracy. We commend their acceptance of the outcome and their use of 
the legal system and the rule of law to resolve disputes.
