Memorandum on Micro-Enterprise Programs
August 26, 1995

Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury

Subject: Micro-Enterprise Programs

    I hereby direct you to take all appropriate actions to coordinate 
all micro-enterprise programs administered by the Federal agencies and 
departments. This should be accomplished through an interagency 
coordinating body chaired by the Administrator of the Community 
Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.
    I also direct you to take the necessary steps for the establishment 
of a presidential awards program designed to honor outstanding micro-
enterprise lenders, consistent with the mission of the CDFI Fund.
    In discharging these responsibilities, you are directed to consult 
with the heads of other Executive departments and agencies as may be 
appropriate.

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on September 1.
