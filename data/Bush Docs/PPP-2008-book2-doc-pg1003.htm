Remarks Following a Meeting With Chancellor Angela Merkel<Merkel, 
Angela<ls-thn-eq> of Germany in Toyako
July 8, 2008

    President Bush. Madam Chancellor, thank you for yet another visit. I 
value your friendship; I value your advice. We talked about a lot of 
common problems and a lot of common opportunities. We talked about the 
G-8. We talked about the need to work--to continue to work together on 
Iran. Angela Merkel is a constructive force for good. And I appreciate 
your time. Thank you.
    Chancellor Merkel. Well, thank you very much. As always, we had a 
very interesting exchange of view, a very intensive exchange of view. 
And let me tell you that I'm very satisfied with the work that has gone 
on, on the G-8 documents, as regards progress on the issue of climate 
change, cooperation in the area of food and oil. We discussed here a 
number of other foreign policy--foreign political issues--sorry. We also 
discussed WTO and the possible conclusion to that negotiating process. 
And let me say that we are hopeful that such a successful conclusion may 
be possible over the next few weeks to come.
    President Bush. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 9:56 a.m. at the Windsor Hotel Toya Resort 
and Spa. Chancellor Merkel spoke in German, and her remarks were 
translated by an interpreter.
