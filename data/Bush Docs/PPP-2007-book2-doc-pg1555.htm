Statement on the Death of Representative Julia M. Carson<Carson, Julia 
M.<ls-thn-eq>
December 15, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by the death of 
Representative Julia Carson. Throughout her decade of service in the 
U.S. House of Representatives and her nearly 20 years in the Indiana 
General Assembly, Representative Carson served her constituents in 
Indianapolis with passion and commitment. She was revered as a champion 
for building strong and safe communities, working to end homelessness, 
improving financial literacy for all Americans, and helping her 
constituents achieve and maintain the dream of homeownership.
    Julia was a dedicated and admired public servant who will be missed 
by her many friends and colleagues both at home in Indiana and in our 
Nation's Capital. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and 
friends.
