Statement on the Fire in Mina, Saudi Arabia
April 15, 1997

    I was deeply saddened to learn today of the tragic loss of life in 
Saudi Arabia among the pilgrims performing the Hajj. I have sent 
condolences to King Fahd on behalf of the American people and extend our 
deepest sympathy to the families of those who were killed or injured in 
the fire.
