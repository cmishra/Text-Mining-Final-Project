Statement on the Death of President Cheddi Jagan of Guyana
March 6, 1997

    It was with deep regret that I learned of the death early today of 
President Cheddi Jagan of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana. President 
Jagan was a respected statesman in our hemisphere of democracies. He was 
one of the founders of the People's Progressive Party and for over 45 
years played an active role in his country's political life. I remember 
warmly our meeting at the Miami Summit of the Americas in December 1994. 
President Jagan was a champion of the poor who devoted himself to 
alleviating poverty in his country and throughout the Caribbean.
    On behalf of the American people, I extend my deepest sympathies to 
the Jagan family and the people of Guyana.
