Statement on the Bombings in Israel
December 1, 2001

    I was horrified and saddened to learn of the bombings that took 
place tonight in Jerusalem. I strongly condemn them as acts of murder 
that no person of conscience can tolerate and no cause can ever justify. 
On behalf of the American people, I extend

my deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, to 
my friend Prime Minister Sharon,<Sharon, Ariel> and to all the 
people of Israel. Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority must 
immediately find and arrest those responsible for these hideous murders. 
They must also act swiftly and decisively against the organizations that 
support them. Now more than ever, Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian 
Authority must demonstrate through their actions, and not merely their 
words, their commitment to fight terror.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
