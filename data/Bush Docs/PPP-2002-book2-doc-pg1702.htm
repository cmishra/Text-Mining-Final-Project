Statement on the Death of Walter Annenberg<Annenberg, Walter<ls-thn-eq>
October 1, 2002

    Walter Annenberg's life serves as a shining example of generosity, 
patriotism, and dedication to serving others. As Ambassador to Great 
Britain, he was an outstanding representative of America to the world. 
As a business leader and an innovator, he understood the media's impact 
on American culture and encouraged television to be a positive influence 
on society.
    Mr. Annenberg firmly believed that strong education was the key to a 
quality citizenry, and his commitment to education reform has benefited 
innumerable lives through research, support for scholarships, and 
greater accessibility to educational programming through public 
television. America is a better place because of his contributions and 
influence. He will be greatly missed, and his legacy will undoubtedly 
live on.
