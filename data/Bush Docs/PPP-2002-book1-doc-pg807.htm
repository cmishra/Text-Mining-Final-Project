Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Reallocation of 
Emergency Response Funds
May 15, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    In furtherance of the provisions of Public Law 107-38, the Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to 
Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 2001, today I am notifying 
the Congress of my intent to reallocate funds previously transferred 
from the Emergency Response Fund.
    This reallocation within the United States Postal Service reflects 
revised requirements related to the anthrax incidents that affected the 
Nation's mail. As provided in Public Law 107-38, the reallocation would 
be effective 15 days from the date of this transmittal.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with his 
comments and observations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
