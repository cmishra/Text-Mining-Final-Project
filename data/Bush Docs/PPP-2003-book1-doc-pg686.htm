Remarks at a Celebration of Black Music Month
June 24, 2003

    I'm feeling pretty energized. [Laughter] Thank you all. Welcome to 
the White House. Laura<Bush, Laura> and I are thrilled you're 
here as we celebrate Black Music Month.
    This is an annual event, and we always try to celebrate it in style. 
And we did. Thank you all so very much for coming. The White House is 
feeling pretty joyous right now. [Laughter]
    We've got some wonderful guests here today. We've got a lot of 
educators and athletes and got the mayor of Hempstead, New York.<Garner, 
James A.> We've got the President--my friend the President of 
Panama<Moscoso, Mireya> Elisa is with us today. Madam 
President, thank you for coming. We're honored you're here. We want to 
thank your Minister of Foreign Relations<Arias, Harmodio> and 
your Ambassador<Alfaro, Roberto> for coming as well.
    Of course, joining us as well are two members from my Cabinet: a 
fabulous Secretary of State, Colin<Powell, Colin L.> Powell--
thank you, Mr. Secretary--the Secretary of Education, Rod Paige.<Paige, 
Roderick R.> Thank you for coming, Mr. Secretary. Condoleezza 
Rice<Rice, Condoleezza> is with us. Condi, thank you for 
coming. We've got other members from my administration. I want to thank 
you for coming. I know Sam Brownback<Brownback, Sam> is here, 
the Senator from Kansas.
    I want to thank so very much Stanley Crouch.<Crouch, 
Stanley> It's wonderful to see you again, sir. We're honored 
you're here. He brightened up one of the book festivals that Laura gave 
a while ago. It's a joyous time to hear him read. You haven't lost your 
touch. [Laughter]
    I want to thank so very much the cast of ``Harlem Song'' for coming. 
You're fantastic artists. Loren,<Schoenberg, Loren> thank you 
very much as well, sir, for you being here, and the Harlem Jazz Museum 
Artists. You really are great. Thanks for coming--appreciate you coming.
    We've got a lot of other great musicians with us today, and I want 
to thank you all for gracing the White House. Thanks for coming back.
    The artists with us today are known and admired for high achievement 
in many musical forms. And the commemoration of this month expresses our 
Nation's pride in the music that Black Americans have created and have 
shared with the world.
    Some of the finest performances by Black Americans have been heard 
right here in the White House and in this room. Lionel Hampton played 
here many times over half a century. Laura<Bush, Laura> and I 
were honored to host him on his last visit to the White House in 2001. 
Duke Ellington performed in the East Room in 1969. He was familiar with 
the place because, after all, his dad worked here as a butler. The 
Steinway grand piano in the foyer has been played by Ellington and Earl 
Hines, by Hank Jones and by Billy Taylor. And when Franklin Roosevelt 
wanted to show the King and Queen of England the finest music in 
America, he brought them to this room to hear Marian Anderson sing ``Ave 
Maria.''
    Those White House performances were moments of triumph for artists 
who loved this country, even when this country did not make them feel 
fully welcomed. And the grace and dignity of their lives is part of the 
story of black music in America. In so many different ways, the artistry 
of black musicians has conveyed the experience of Black Americans 
throughout our history. From the earliest generations of slaves came 
music of sorrow and patience, of truth and righteousness, and of faith 
that shamed the oppressor and called upon the justice of Almighty God 
and praised His holy name.
    Out of this heritage has come a tremendous variety of music, 
expressed in gospel

and jazz, in rhythm and blues, and in rock and roll. Lyrics first heard 
in the country churches in the Mississippi Delta and songs first played 
in the clubs of Harlem and Chicago and Memphis are now recognized and 
loved in every part of America and throughout the world. The music we 
honor this month could have only come from the unique experience of 
Black Americans.
    Yet, at its best, this music speaks to every heart. Your day is a 
little better when you hear Nat King Cole sing ``Unforgettable,'' or 
Aaron Neville<Neville, Aaron> ``Tell it Like it Is''--
[laughter]--or Diana Ross<Ross, Diana> singing 
``Reflections,'' or B.B. King<King, B> B. lamenting, ``The 
Thrill is Gone.'' [Laughter] Or how about when James Brown<Brown, 
James> proclaims, ``I Feel Good''? [Laughter] Or Mahalia 
Jackson praising our ``Precious Lord.''
    This is some of the greatest music America has ever produced. 
America is thankful to the men and women who have shared this gift with 
us all. And so today I've signed a proclamation designating June 2003 as 
Black Music Month in the United States of America.
    May God bless your talents, and may God continue to bless the United 
States of America. Thank you for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 5:38 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Mayor James A. Garner of 
Hempstead, NY; President Mireya Elisa Moscoso, Foreign Minister Harmodio 
Arias, and Ambassador to the United States Roberto Alfaro of Panama; 
writer and jazz critic Stanley Crouch; jazz musician Loren Schoenberg; 
and the Harlem Jazz Museum Artists musical group. The Black Music Month 
proclamation of June 24 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
