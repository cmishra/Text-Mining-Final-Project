Statement on Credit Availability
June 24, 1993

    Today's announcement by the FDIC is another tangible benefit brought 
on by the progress of our deficit reduction plan and the lower interest 
rates it has produced. Fewer bank failures means more and cheaper bank 
loans to America's businesses and communities. It means billions of 
dollars more for new jobs, new businesses, and helping families buy new 
homes. It shows once again how critically important it is for Congress 
to lock in the benefits of lower interest rates and deficit reduction by 
approving the Clinton economic plan.
