Statement on Signing the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for 
Students Act of 2003
August 18, 2003

    Today, I have signed into law H.R. 1412, the ``Higher Education 
Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003.'' This Act permits the 
Secretary of Education to waive or modify Federal student financial 
assistance program requirements to help students and their families or 
academic institutions affected by a war, other military operation, or 
national emergency. The executive branch shall construe section 2(c) in 
a manner consistent with the President's authority under the 
Recommendations Clause of the Constitution to submit for the 
consideration of the Congress such measures as the President shall judge 
necessary or expedient.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 August 18, 2003.

Note: H.R. 1412, approved August 18, was assigned Public Law No. 108-76.
