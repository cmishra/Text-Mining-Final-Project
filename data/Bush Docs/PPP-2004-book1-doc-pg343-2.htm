Remarks at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in Houston
March 8, 2004

    It's really good to be here. I thought there's a lot of bull in 
Washington, DC. [Laughter] But I'm really glad to be here at the 
livestock show. It's--somebody said, ``What's it like when you come 
here?'' It's like being in a place with people who are willing to stand 
up to values that are important in this country.
    So it's great to be here. I want to congratulate the winners, 
congratulate the--congratulate the young who are here who are working 
outdoors with the animals and practicing important--important values 
that will take them through the rest of their life.
    I worked the ropeline, worked the fenceline coming out. I can't tell 
you how many people said, ``Mr. President, we're praying for you in 
Iraq.'' On behalf of a grateful world, I want to thank you for that very 
much. And I want to thank you for your hospitality. May God bless you 
all, and may God continue to bless America.

Note: The President spoke at 3:25 p.m. at Reliant Arena. The Office of 
the Press Secretary released the transcript of these remarks on March 9. 
A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
