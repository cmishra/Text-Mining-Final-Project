Message to the Senate Transmitting the Trinidad and Tobago-United States 
Extradition Treaty With Documentation
July 31, 1997

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of 
Trinidad and Tobago, signed at Port of Spain on March 4, 1996.
    In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the 
report explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.
    The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content 
of extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.
    This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between 
the law enforcement communities of both countries and thereby make a 
significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. Upon 
entry into force, it will supersede the Extradition Treaty between the 
United States and Great Britain signed at London on December 22, 1931, 
and made applicable to Trinidad and Tobago upon its entry into force on 
June 24, 1935, and which the United States and Trinidad and Tobago have 
continued to apply following Trinidad and Tobago's independence. That 
treaty has become outmoded, and the new Treaty will provide significant 
improvements.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 31, 1997.
