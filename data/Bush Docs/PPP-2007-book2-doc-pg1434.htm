Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments for the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice
November 6, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2008 
requests for the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice. These 
amendments, when combined with funding enacted earlier this year for the 
FBI (Public Law 110-28), would provide $436 million to take important 
steps to enhance ongoing efforts for protecting the homeland. The 
amendments will enhance the security of the Government's civilian cyber 
networks and will further address emerging threats.
    Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2008 
Budget would not be increased. The details of these amendments proposal 
are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
