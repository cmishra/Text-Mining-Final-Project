Remarks Following a Meeting With Secretary of Defense Donald H. 
Rumsfeld<Rumsfeld, Donald H.<ls-thn-eq>
October 5, 2005

    The President. I just had a briefing from Secretary Rumsfeld and 
General Pace<Pace, Peter<ls-thn-eq> on our ongoing operations in the 
western part of Iraq. As you know, we're on the offense against 
insurgents and terrorists. We fully understand they intend to disrupt 
the constitutional process, or will try to do so, as well as stop the 
progress of democracy. And part of the way the Pentagon and the folks on 
the ground are going to deal with it is to stay on the offense, and 
that's what's taking place.
    I was also pleased to hear there are 3,000 Iraqi forces in the 
fight, that they're doing a fine job out there, that they're--they make 
a difference on the battlefield.
    We also have General Petraeus<Petraeus, David H.<ls-thn-eq> with us, 
who has served incredibly well in Iraq. His job was to help U.S. forces 
and coalition forces train the Iraqis so they can take the fight to the 
enemy. He briefed me and will be briefing the country at the Pentagon 
here a little later on, about the strong progress that we're making, 
that we've recruited a lot of folks, but we've got more than just 
recruitment going on. We've got a quality control program in place to 
make sure that the troops we train are capable of taking the fight to 
the enemy. Over 30 percent of the Iraqi troops are in the lead on these 
offensive operations. We've got troops embedded with them, and it's 
important for the training mission. But, nevertheless, the Iraqis are 
showing more and more capability to take the fight to the enemy. And 
that's how we're going to succeed in helping democracy become 
established in Iraq.
    I've told the American people all along, our troops will stay there 
as long as necessary. We'll do the job. We'll train these folks, and as 
they become more capable, we will be able to bring folks home with the 
honor they've earned.
    And we're seeing progress on the ground, and we're also seeing 
political progress on the ground. The constitution has been written. 
Folks will have a chance to vote it up or down here this month. And then 
there will be elections, if the constitution is approved, for a 
permanent government.
    So on the one hand, we're making progress when it comes to training 
Iraqis to take the fight to the enemy. We're bringing the enemy to 
justice. We're on the offense. On the other hand, democracy is moving 
forward in a part of the world that is so desperate for democracy and so 
desperate for freedom.
    And so, General, I want to thank you for your service--General 
Petraeus.<Petraeus, David H.<ls-thn-eq>
    Lt. Gen. Petraeus.<Petraeus, David H.<ls-thn-eq> Thank you, sir.
    The President. Thank you for your service too. But thank you for 
your service. You've done a fine job.
    Lt. Gen. Petraeus.<Petraeus, David H.<ls-thn-eq> Thank you, sir.
