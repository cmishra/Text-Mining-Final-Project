Nomination for the Environmental Protection Agency
September 26, 1994

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Fred 
Hansen to be the Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency.
    ``Through his accomplished State leadership, Fred Hansen brings real 
environmental expertise and commitment to this position,'' the President 
said. ``I am confident that his service at the E.P.A. will be marked by 
the same excellence and leadership he has shown in Oregon as a long-time 
environmental leader there.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
