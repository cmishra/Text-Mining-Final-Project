Message on the Observance of Cinco de Mayo, 1995
May 1, 1995

    Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
    The Fifth of May offers all of us a chance to celebrate the cultural 
diversity that helps to make our nation great. The vibrant Mexican 
culture, based on faith, family, and patriotism, has added a wealth of 
tradition to this country. Cinco de Mayo is an important part of this 
legacy, reminding us of the courage and commitment that can sustain the 
forces of freedom even when they are confronted with overwhelming 
opposition.
    The liberty won by the outnumbered Mexican army more than a century 
ago lives on today as a part of the rich heritage of the Mexican people. 
Each time we remember the victory at the Battle of Puebla, we rejoice in 
the triumph of freedom and the blessings of tradition.
    Hillary and I are pleased to extend best wishes for a most memorable 
and enjoyable holiday.

                                                            Bill Clinton
