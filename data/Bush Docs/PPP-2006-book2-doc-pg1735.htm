Message to the Congress Transmitting the District of Columbia's Fiscal 
Year 2007 Budget Request
September 29, 2006

To the Congress of the United States:
    Pursuant to my constitutional authority and consistent with section 
446 of The District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization Act as 
amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's 2007 
Budget Request Act.
    The proposed 2007 Budget Request Act reflects the major programmatic 
objectives of the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia. For 
2007, the District estimates total revenues and expenditures of $7.61 
billion.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,
