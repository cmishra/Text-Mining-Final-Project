Statement on Congressional Passage of Legislation Supporting Iran's 
Freedom
September 30, 2006

    My administration is working on many fronts to address the 
challenges posed by the Iranian regime's pursuit of weapons of mass 
destruction, support for terrorism, efforts to destabilize the Middle 
East, and repression of the fundamental human rights of the citizens of 
Iran. We are engaged in intense diplomacy alongside our allies and have 
also undertaken financial measures to counter the actions of the Iranian 
regime.
    I applaud Congress for demonstrating its bipartisan commitment to 
confronting the Iranian regime's repressive and destabilizing activities 
by passing the Iran Freedom Support Act. This legislation will codify 
U.S. sanctions on Iran while providing my administration with 
flexibility to tailor those sanctions in appropriate circumstances and 
impose sanctions upon entities that aid the Iranian regime's development 
of nuclear weapons.
    I applaud the efforts of Chairman Richard Shelby,<Shelby, Richard 
C.<ls-thn-eq> Ranking Member Paul Sarbanes,<Sarbanes, Paul 
Spyros<ls-thn-eq> Rick Santorum,<Santorum, Rick<ls-thn-eq> and Bill 
Nelson<Nelson, C. William<ls-thn-eq> in the Senate and Chairman Henry 
Hyde,<Hyde, Henry J.<ls-thn-eq> Ranking Member Tom Lantos,<Lantos, 
Thomas P.<ls-thn-eq> Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,<Ros-Lehtinen, 
Ileana<ls-thn-eq> and Gary Ackerman<Ackerman, Gary L.<ls-thn-eq> in the 
House. I look forward to signing this bill into law, which will 
facilitate America's support for the Iranian people in their efforts to 
build a just, free, and peaceful society.

Note: The statement referred to H.R. 6198.
