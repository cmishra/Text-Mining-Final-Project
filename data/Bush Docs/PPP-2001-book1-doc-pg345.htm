Statement on the Situation in the Middle East
March 29, 2001

    I am deeply concerned about the escalating violence in the Middle 
East. It is claiming the lives of innocent civilians on both sides. The 
tragic cycle of incitement, provocation, and violence has gone on far 
too long.
    Both sides must take important steps to calm the situation now. The 
Palestinian Authority should speak out publicly and forcefully in the 
language of the Palestinian people to condemn violence and terrorism. It 
should arrest the perpetrators of terrorist acts, and it should resume 
security cooperation with Israel.
    The Government of Israel, for its part, should exercise restraint in 
its military response. It should take steps to restore normalcy to the 
lives of the Palestinian people by easing closures and removing 
checkpoints. Last week Prime Minister Sharon<Sharon, Ariel<ls-thn-eq> 
assured me that his government wants to move in this direction, and I 
urge Israel to do so.
    I will be meeting with Egypt's President Mubarak<Mubarak, 
Hosni<ls-thn-eq> next Monday and Jordan's King Abdullah<King Abdullah 
II<ls-thn-eq> the week after to seek their help in defusing the 
tensions. Egypt and Jordan are two of our most important partners in the 
region, and their role is crucial. I have asked Secretary Powell<Powell, 
Colin L.<ls-thn-eq> to call Chairman Arafat<Arafat, Yasser<ls-thn-eq> 
and contact other leaders to urge them to stand against violence. Our 
diplomats in the region are fully engaged in this effort.
    Our goal is to encourage a series of reciprocal and parallel steps 
by both sides that will halt the escalation of violence, provide safety 
and security for civilians on both sides, and restore normalcy to the 
lives of everyone in the region. A lasting peace in the region will come 
only when the parties agree directly on its terms.
    This week I vetoed an unbalanced U.N. resolution because it tried to 
force the adoption of a mechanism on which both parties did not agree. 
My approach will be to facilitate the parties' work in finding their own 
solution for peace. We seek to build a stable foundation for restoring 
confidence, rebuilding security cooperation, and resuming a political 
dialog between the parties.
