Remarks Following an Aerial Tour of Areas Damaged by Wildfires in 
Redding, California
July 17, 2008

    The President. It's been my honor to travel with the 
Governor<Schwarzenegger, Arnold A.<ls-thn-eq> and the Senator<Feinstein, 
Dianne<ls-thn-eq> and Forest Service folks and the fire folks here in 
California to see the fires. Couple of things I'd like to reflect on, 
and I asked the Governor to say a couple of words.
    One, I always come to make sure that the Federal Government is 
coordinating closely with the State government. I know Governor 
Schwarzenegger<Schwarzenegger, Arnold A.<ls-thn-eq> well enough to tell 
you that if we weren't, he'd let me know.
    Governor Arnold A. Schwarzenegger<Schwarzenegger, Arnold 
A.<ls-thn-eq> of California. That's right.
    The President. And I want to thank those in the--who work for the 
Federal Government for their hard work and willingness to respond 
quickly and their service to our country.
    Secondly, I want to say something to the firefighters. We had the 
privilege of going and meeting some of these smoke jumpers. These are 
unusual people who are very courageous, determined, and dedicated.

And I had this special sense there, when I was with them, the esprit de 
corps, and we want to thank them for their courage.
    I want to thank all those who are helping making the effort work 
here. People are working long hours, and the citizens of this part of 
the world really, really thank you for it.
    I want to thank the Boy Scouts. We've got three<Hendrick, 
Mark<ls-thn-eq> scouts<Wellman, Jake<ls-thn-eq> here<Braden, 
Alex<ls-thn-eq> who are representative of a bunch of scouts who are 
working on the Healthy Forest Initiative and are helping make sure these 
firefighters are--don't have to deal with some of these hot blazes the 
way they have in the past.
    And finally, I'd like to just let the people out here know that 
we're paying attention in Washington, DC, we care about you, and that 
we'll respond as best as we possibly can.

Note: The President spoke at 4 p.m. at the Northern Operations Command 
Center. In his remarks, he referred to Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The 
transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included
