Statement on Senator Phil Gramm's<Gramm, Phil> Decision Not To 
Seek Reelection
September 4, 2001

    The Senate is losing a principled leader with the decision of Phil 
Gramm to retire after over two decades of distinguished service to the 
people of Texas and America. Senator Gramm is a man of common sense and 
uncommon courage who bases decisions on principle and always fights for 
what he believes is right.
    Senator Gramm has been a consistent and committed advocate of tax 
relief for working Americans, beginning with his work on President 
Reagan's tax cut in 1981 as a Member of the House of Representatives and 
continuing with his tireless efforts to pass this year's monumental tax 
relief package.
    As chairman and ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, 
Senator Gramm has been responsible for major reforms, including the 
landmark Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act.
    Senator Gramm is a close friend and valued adviser, and I look 
forward to working closely with him during the remainder of his term.
    Laura and I extend our thanks to Phil, Wendy,<Gramm, 
Wendy> and their children, Marshall<Gramm, Marshall> 
and Jeff,<Gramm, Jeff> for their family's commitment to public 
service and wish them all the best in the future.
