Remarks to the 1999 NCAA Football Champion Florida State Seminoles
March 2, 2000

    The President. Thank you very much. Please be seated. Well, 
President D'Alemberte,<D'Alemberte, Talbot<ls-thn-eq> I was hardly old 
enough to vote the first time I met you. [Laughter] You're aging well. 
[Laughter]
    Coach Bowden,<Bowden, Bobby<ls-thn-eq> welcome. I also want to 
welcome all the Floridians who are here. I thank Senator Graham<Graham, 
Bob<ls-thn-eq> and Senator Mack<Mack, Connie<ls-thn-eq> for coming; and 
Representatives Boyd,<Boyd, Allen<ls-thn-eq> Brown,<Brown, 
Corrine<ls-thn-eq> Deutsch,<Deutsch, Peter<ls-thn-eq> Foley,<Foley, 
Mark<ls-thn-eq> and Miller.<Miller, Dan<ls-thn-eq> And we have--Senator 
Breaux<Breaux, John B.<ls-thn-eq> from Louisiana is here, and 
Congressman Blumenauer<Blumenauer, Earl<ls-thn-eq> from Oregon are here. 
I don't know if they're trying to spy for their football teams--
[laughter]--but we're honored to have them. The mayor of Tallahassee is 
here, Scott Maddox;<Maddox, Scott<ls-thn-eq> and State Representative 
Margie Turnbull.<Turnbull, Marjorie R.<ls-thn-eq> We welcome all of 
them. And mostly, I want to say a warm word of welcome to the Seminoles. 
I want to welcome you back to the White House.
    This was the first national champion football team that I welcomed 
at the White House, in early 1994. And that team was 12 and 1; this team 
is undefeated. I came in with you, and I'm going out with you.

[[Page 361]]

    This team has won 109 games, this Florida State team, in the 
1990's--truly the team of the decade in American football. In the first 
Sugar Bowl of the new millennium, you played a Virginia Tech team that 
you got way ahead of, but I think you must respect them a lot because 
they didn't give up. And Michael Vick<Vick, Michael<ls-thn-eq> and his 
Hokie teammates turned out to be worthy adversaries, Coach.<Bowden, 
Bobby<ls-thn-eq> And for those of us who love football, it was a sight 
to behold.
    We all sat on the edge of our seats as you reclaimed the lead in the 
fourth quarter with your 85-yard scoring drive and quarterback Chris 
Weinke's<Weinke, Chris<ls-thn-eq> touchdown pass to Ron Dugans.<Dugans, 
Ron<ls-thn-eq> It was a 46-29 victory, hard won and richly deserved. 
After it was over, I think there wasn't a single football fan in America 
who doubted that Florida State was truly the best team in the country 
and a deserving national champion.
    I could say a lot about all the players and the ones who had 
starring roles in the games, and not just the championship game but the 
other games. I watched several of them on television last year.
    But I want to say a special word of personal admiration and respect 
for Coach Bowden.<Bowden, Bobby<ls-thn-eq> I have watched him<Bowden, 
Bobby<ls-thn-eq> year-in and year-out. I have watched him be gracious in 
victory and gracious in defeat, which is more difficult. Of course, it's 
easy if you don't lose very much. [Laughter] That makes it a little 
easier. But I have been immensely impressed by the leadership that he 
and his team have brought to the young men that have been on this 
football team, especially this year, but also in past years.
    Bobby,<Bowden, Bobby<ls-thn-eq> I was told that for 24 years you had 
an empty picture frame on your desk, waiting for an undefeated team, and 
I'm glad you can finally fill that picture frame. Congratulations to 
you.
    And let me say to all the young men on this team, some of you will 
play some more football and go on into the pro ranks, and if you do, I 
wish you well. Most college football players, even on national 
championship teams, don't go on to play in the pro ranks, and I wish you 
well, too. What it takes to win on the football team, hard work and 
discipline and devotion to a common effort, give you pretty good lessons 
for life. And if you remember what brought you to the national 
championship, you'll be a champion when you leave Florida State whether 
you play any more football or not.
    That is the ultimate lesson, Coach,<Bowden, Bobby<ls-thn-eq> of the 
way you run this team. I respect you; I admire you. I congratulate you 
all. And I thank you for giving the rest of us who just watch from the 
stands or on television a magnificent season. Thank you very much.

[At this point, Talbot D'Alemberte,<D'Alemberte, Talbot<ls-thn-eq> 
president, Florida State University, and Bobby Bowden,<Bowden, 
Bobby<ls-thn-eq> coach, Florida State Seminoles, made brief remarks; and 
player Todd Frier<Frier, Todd<ls-thn-eq> presented the President with a 
team jersey.]

    The President. That's great. I'm going to have to bulk up before I 
can--[laughter]. Well, this is terrific. I want to thank all of you. A 
lot of people here I see made the trip up from Florida, and I want to 
welcome you to the White House and, in closing, just say this: When we 
have an event like this and we're able to invite people to come in here 
and express their pride and support for some remarkable achievement, it 
embodies the motto that the White House is the people's house.
    And I think I should tell you that this is not only the first 
national championship of this new millennium, the first national 
championship team, but you are coming here in the 200th anniversary of 
the White House. It was completed in 1800, and John Adams, our second 
President, was the first person to live here. Every President since then 
has lived here.
    And this house has seen a lot of changes and a lot of things come 
and go. But the feelings you have today and, I hope, the pride you feel 
as Americans in being here are what has sustained us now for 200 years. 
And if we just keep them, a couple hundred years from now, there will be 
another group of young people here celebrating an athletic achievement. 
Chances are they'll still be playing football, and the offensive line 
will average 500 pounds. [Laughter]
    Thank you very much, and welcome.

Note: The President spoke at 6:22 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Representatives Corrine Brown and 
Dan Miller; and Michael Vick, quarterback, Virginia Tech Hokies. The 
transcript released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included 
the remarks of President D'Alemberte, Coach Bowden, and Mr. Frier.
