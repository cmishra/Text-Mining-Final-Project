Statement With Congressional Leaders on the Economic Situation in Mexico
January 12, 1995

    We agreed that the United States has an important economic and 
strategic interest in a stable and prosperous Mexico.
    Ultimately, the solution to Mexico's economic problems must come 
from the people of Mexico, but we are pursuing ways to increase 
financial confidence and to encourage further reform in Mexico.
    We agreed to do what is necessary to restore financial confidence in 
Mexico without affecting the current budget at home.

Note: This statement was announced jointly with Newt Gingrich, Speaker 
of the House of Representatives, Robert Dole, Senate majority leader, 
Thomas Daschle, Senate minority leader, Richard Armey, House majority 
leader, and Richard Gephardt, House minority leader.
