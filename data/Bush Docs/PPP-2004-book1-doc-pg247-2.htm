Statement on the Recess Appointment of William H. Pryor, Jr.,<Pryor, 
William H., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> as a United States Court of Appeals Circuit 
Judge
February 20, 2004

    Today I exercised my constitutional authority to appoint William H. 
Pryor, Jr., to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Eleventh Circuit. Bill Pryor has served as the attorney general of 
Alabama since 1997 and has had a distinguished career as a public 
servant and practicing attorney. His impressive record demonstrates his 
devotion to the rule of law and to treating all people equally under the 
law. He has received widespread bipartisan support from those who know 
him and know his record. I am proud to name this leading American lawyer 
to the appellate bench.
    Attorney General Pryor was nominated more than 10 months ago but 
still has not received an up-or-down vote in the Senate. A bipartisan 
majority of Senators supports his confirmation. If Attorney General 
Pryor were given a vote on the floor of the Senate, he would be 
confirmed. But a minority of Democratic Senators has been using 
unprecedented obstructionist tactics to prevent him and other qualified 
nominees from receiving up-or-down votes. Their tactics are inconsistent 
with the Senate's constitutional responsibility and are hurting our 
judicial system.
    As a result of today's recess appointment, Attorney General Pryor 
will fill a seat on the Eleventh Circuit that has been designated a 
judicial emergency. He will perform a valuable service on a court that 
needs more judges to do its work with the efficiency the American people 
deserve and

expect. Again I call on those in the Senate who are playing politics 
with the American judicial system to stop so that my nominees receive 
the up-or-down votes they deserve.
