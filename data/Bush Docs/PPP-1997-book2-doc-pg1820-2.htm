Statement on the Death of Esther Peterson
December 22, 1997

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn of the death of Esther 
Peterson. She was the mother of the modern consumer movement, a woman 
who dedicated her life to improving the standard of living for all 
Americans. In her long career, she was a trusted adviser to President 
Kennedy, President Johnson, and President Carter. I was grateful for her 
sage counsel and for her service to this country. As a member of the 
United States delegation to the United Nations, she was dedicated to 
promoting American values at home and abroad. She will be greatly 
missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her children and 
grandchildren.
