Message to the Congress Transmitting District of Columbia 
Budget Requests
May 4, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the District of Columbia Self-Government and 
Governmental Reorganization Act, I am transmitting the District of 
Columbia Government's 1995 budget request and 1994 revised budget 
request.
    The District of Columbia Government has submitted a 1995 budget 
request for $3,409 million in 1995 that includes a Federal payment of 
$674 million, the amount authorized and requested by the Mayor and the 
City Council. The 1995 Federal payment level proposed in my fiscal year 
1995 budget of $670 million is also included in the District's 1995 
budget as an alternative level. My transmittal of the District's budget, 
as required by law, does not represent an endorsement of its contents.
    I look forward to working with the Congress throughout the 1995 
appropriation process.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

May 4, 1994.
