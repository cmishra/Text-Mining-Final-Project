    The President announced his intention today to nominate Jere W. 
Glover, the founder of several small businesses, to be the Small 
Business Administration's Chief Counsel for Advocacy. The Chief Counsel 
acts as a spokesman for small business interests throughout the 
Government, as well as being an adviser to the SBA Administrator and 
overseeing the development of research and economic analysis projects on 
behalf of the small business community.
    ``Jere Glover knows what it takes to make a small business 
successful, and he knows how Government works. As the SBA's Chief 
Counsel, he will work to make every part of the Federal Government 
responsive to small businesses' needs.''
