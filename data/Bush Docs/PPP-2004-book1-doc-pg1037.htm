Exchange With Reporters in Liberty, Missouri
June 14, 2004

Medicare Drug Discount Card

    Q. How much did she save, Mr. President?
    The President. Seventeen dollars. Her total cost is $1.90.
    Q. Not bad.
    The President. So, like, if you add $17 to $1.90--[laughter]--here, 
Wanda,<Blackmore, Wanda<ls-thn-eq> come over here. Give us your card.
    One of the reasons we're here is we want people to understand the 
benefits of this card so more people use it.
    Wanda Blackmore.<Blackmore, Wanda<ls-thn-eq> This is my Medicare 
card.
    The President. Yes, brand new. When did you get it?
    Ms. Blackmore.<Blackmore, Wanda<ls-thn-eq> I got this Saturday, and 
this is the second time I've used it.
    The President. What's that going to do for you?
    Ms. Blackmore.<Blackmore, Wanda<ls-thn-eq> Keep my blood flowing.
    The President. Keep your blood flowing. [Laughter]

Note: The exchange began at 3:11 p.m. at the Hy-Vee pharmacy. A tape was
