Statement on the Return of Governors Island to the People of New York
January 31, 2003

    I am pleased to announce the return of Governors Island to the 
people of New York. Last April, I informed the Governor<Pataki, George 
E.> and the mayor<Bloomberg, Michael> of my 
intention to make this transfer, and today, the transfer is complete. 
Also, I am reaffirming our support for the Governors Island National 
Monument, which now will encompass approximately 22 of the Island's 172 
acres, including historic Castle Williams and Fort Jay.
    Governor Pataki<Pataki, George E.> and Mayor 
Bloomberg<Bloomberg, Michael> have shared with me their vision 
of a Governors Island dedicated to public and civic purposes. New York's 
stewardship of the island combined with the National Park Service's 
management of the monument will lead to the development of an 
outstanding resource for the people of New York and all who visit.
    I commend the parties that worked together to make this historic 
transfer a reality, including the National Park Service, the General 
Services Administration, the United States Coast Guard, the National 
Trust for Historic Preservation, and especially the State and City of 
New York.

Note: The proclamation of February 7 on establishment of the Governors 
Island National Monument is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
