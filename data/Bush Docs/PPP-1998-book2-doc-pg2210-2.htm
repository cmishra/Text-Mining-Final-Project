Statement on the National Economy
December 24, 1998

    Today we received more evidence that our economy remains solid and 
strong, more proof that the economic strategy we have had in place for 6 
years is serving America's working families well. Last month personal 
income rose a strong 0.5 percent. That's good news in this holiday 
season and good news for our future. Over the past year, personal 
incomes have increased nearly 5 percent, far faster than the rate of 
inflation.
    While we should be pleased with our strong economic progress, now is 
not a time to rest; it is a time to build. To ensure that America's 
economy continues to work for America's working families, we must 
maintain the three-part economic strategy that has helped produce these 
remarkable gains. We must maintain our fiscal discipline; continue to 
invest in our people through education, health care, and research and 
development; and continue to lead the global economy.
