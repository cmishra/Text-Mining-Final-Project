Statement on Congressional Action on Trade Promotion Authority 
Legislation
July 27, 2002

    For nearly 10 years, America has lacked trade promotion authority 
and the ability to fully take advantage of trade opportunities. I 
commend the House and Senate conferees for their leadership in reaching 
a landmark agreement on TPA, which will open markets, expand 
opportunity, and create jobs for American workers and farmers. The House 
has shown a commitment to getting something done on behalf of the 
American people, and I urge the Senate to vote on this good bill before 
the Senate goes home for the August recess.
