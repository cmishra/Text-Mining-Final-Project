Remarks on the 2008 Economic Report of the President
February 11, 2008

    The President. I want to thank members of my economic team for 
submitting this Economic Report of the President. I'm about to sign it. 
And so I want to--Eddie,<Lazear, Edward P.<ls-thn-eq> thank you for your 
good work, you and your team.
    Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Edward P. Lazear.<Lazear, 
Edward P.<ls-thn-eq> My pleasure.
    The President. This report indicates that our economy is 
structurally sound for the long term and that we're dealing with 
uncertainties in the short term. And therefore, what should we do about 
it? Well, I am so pleased that the Congress and the administration 
worked closely together to pass a robust progrowth package to deal with 
the uncertainty. That package is about 160 billion-plus dollars. What 
that means is, it means that money will be going directly to America: 
workers and families and individuals. It also means that there is 
incentives for American businesses.
    I'll be signing this bill soon. But if you're a taxpayer or if 
you're a--got income up to--earned income--I mean, credited income up to 
$3,000, you can expect money back. And if you're a businessowner, you're 
going to get some incentives to invest. And so you ought to be planning 
upon it--on investing now.
    And so I really want to thank the Congress for getting this bill 
done, and I'm looking forward to signing it. It's going to help deal 
with the uncertainties in this economy.
    Thank you all very much.

Note: The President spoke at 1:07 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to H.R. 5140.
