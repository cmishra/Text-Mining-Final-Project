Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Fiscal Year 2003 Budget Amendments
November 13, 2002

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed requests for FY 2003 
budget amendments for the Department of Justice and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
    In total, these amendments would not affect the budgetary resources 
proposed in my FY 2003 Budget.
    The details of these requests are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. I concur with 
his comments and observations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: An original was not available for verification of the content of
