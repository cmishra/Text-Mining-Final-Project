Statement on the Approval of a Strategic Framework Agreement and a 
Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq
November 27, 2008

    Earlier today, in another sign of progress, Iraq's Council of 
Representatives approved two agreements with the United States, a 
strategic framework agreement and a security agreement, often called a 
status of forces agreement or SOFA. The strategic framework agreement 
sets the foundation for a long-term bilateral relationship between our 
two countries, and the security agreement addresses our presence, 
activities, and withdrawal from Iraq. Today's vote affirms the growth of 
Iraq's democracy and increasing ability to secure itself. We look 
forward to a swift approval by Iraq's Presidency Council.
    Two years ago, this day seemed unlikely, but the success of the 
surge and the courage of the Iraqi people set the conditions for these 
two agreements to be negotiated and approved by the Iraqi Parliament.

improved conditions on the ground and the Parliamentary approval of 
these two agreements serve as a testament to the Iraqi, coalition, and 
American men and women, both military and civilian, who paved the way 
for this day.
    As the two agreements move to Iraq's Presidency Council for final 
approval, we congratulate the members of the Council of Representatives 
for coming together to approve these historic agreements that will serve 
the shared and enduring interests of both our countries and the region.

Note: The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
version of this statement.
