Statement on Representative Richard A. Gephardt's<Gephardt, Richard 
A.> Decision Not To Seek the Presidential Nomination
February 3, 1999

    Democratic Leader Gephardt and I had a good meeting this morning. He 
and I discussed his decision, and I feel he made the choice for the 
right reasons. I am pleased he will continue to focus on an agenda that 
will strengthen our Nation for the 21st century: saving Social Security 
and Medicare, strengthening public education, maintaining a strong 
economy, passing a Patients' Bill of Rights.
    Dick has been a key ally for the past 6 years, and I know he will 
continue to be for the next 2. His leadership has been central to so 
many of the successes the Nation has enjoyed these past 6 years: from 
the 1993 economic plan to family and medical leave to expanding health 
care coverage and raising the minimum wage.
    Finally, on a personal level, Hillary and I value Dick and 
Jane's<Gephardt, Jane> friendship and look forward to Dick's 
continued leadership.
