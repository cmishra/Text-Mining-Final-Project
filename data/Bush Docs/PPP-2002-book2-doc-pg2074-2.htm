Statement on Elections in Bahrain
November 14, 2002

    The United States welcomes Bahrain's first parliamentary elections 
in nearly 30 years. Bahrain is a close friend and an important example 
of a nation making the transition to democracy.
    The national elections recently concluded promise to strengthen the 
establishment of representative institutions in Bahrain and to help meet 
the political aspirations of all its citizens, including women who fully 
participated in the electoral process.
    I strongly support the efforts that King Hamad<King Hamad<ls-thn-eq> 
and the people of Bahrain have undertaken to uphold democratic 
principles and the rule of law. The United States will continue to 
support Bahrain as it pursues these goals.
