Statement on the Situation in Lebanon
May 12, 2008

    I strongly condemn Hizballah's recent efforts, and those of their 
foreign sponsors in Tehran and Damascus, to use violence and 
intimidation to bend the Government and people of Lebanon to their will. 
The United States will continue to firmly support the Government of 
Lebanon, led by Prime Minister Siniora,<Siniora, Fuad<ls-thn-eq> against 
this effort

to undermine the hard-fought gains in sovereignty and independence the 
Lebanese people have made in recent years. The international community 
will not allow the Iranian and Syrian regimes, via their proxies, to 
return Lebanon to foreign domination and control. To ensure the safety 
and security of the people of Lebanon, the United States will continue 
its assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces to ensure they are able to 
defend the Lebanese Government and safeguard its institutions.
    It is critical that the international community come together to 
assist the Lebanese people in their hour of need. I plan to consult with 
regional leaders on my upcoming trip to the Middle East to coordinate 
efforts to support the Lebanese Government and implement U.N. Security 
Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701, among others, which seek to bolster 
Lebanon's sovereignty against external efforts at destabilization and 
interference. The Lebanese people have sacrificed much for the sake of 
their freedom, and the United States will continue to stand with them 
against this latest assault on their independence and security.
