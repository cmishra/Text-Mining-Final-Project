Statement on the Election of the Presidency Council of the Iraqi 
Transitional Government
April 6, 2005

    Iraq's Transitional National Assembly took a momentous step forward 
in Iraq's transition to democracy today, voting by an overwhelming 
majority to elect the Presidency Council of the Iraqi Transitional 
Government.
    I congratulate Iraq's next President, Jalal Talabani,<Talabani, 
Jalal<ls-thn-eq> and its next Deputy Presidents, Adil Abd al-
Mahdi<Mahdi, Adil al- <ls-thn-eq> and Ghazi al-Ujayl al-Yawr,<Yawr, 
Ghazi al-Ujayl al- <ls-thn-eq> on this historic occasion. These 
individuals will be formally sworn in tomorrow and will move quickly to 
name a Prime Minister who will work during the coming days to select a 
Council of Ministers. The new Iraqi Government will then begin its 
important work of writing a new constitution, continuing to train Iraqi 
security forces, delivering basic services, and advancing Iraq's 
transformation from dictatorship to democracy.
    The Iraqi people have shown their commitment to democracy, and we, 
in turn, are committed to Iraq. We look forward to working with this new 
Government, and we congratulate all Iraqis on this historic day.
