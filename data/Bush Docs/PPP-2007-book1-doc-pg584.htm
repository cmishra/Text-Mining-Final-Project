Statement on the Appointment of Lieutenant General Douglas Lute<Lute, 
Douglas<ls-thn-eq> as Assistant to the President and Deputy National 
Security Adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan
May 15, 2007

    I have chosen Lieutenant General Douglas Lute to serve as Assistant 
to the President and Deputy National Security Adviser for Iraq and 
Afghanistan. General Lute is a tremendously accomplished military leader 
who understands war and government and knows how to get things done. 
While serving at Central Command, General Lute played an integral role 
in implementing combat operation plans in Iraq and Afghanistan, and 
gained a critical understanding of the challenges we face in the global 
war on terror. He has already earned the respect and trust of the 
officials with whom he will be working in his new role.
    In his new position, General Lute will be the full-time manager for 
the implementation and execution of our strategies for Iraq and 
Afghanistan and will manage the interagency policy development process 
for these two theaters, working closely with my National Security 
Adviser, Steve Hadley,<Hadley, Stephen J.<ls-thn-eq> members of my 
Cabinet, and me. Nothing is more important than getting Admiral 
Fallon,<Fallon, William J.<ls-thn-eq> General Petraeus,<Petraeus, David 
H.<ls-thn-eq> American commanders in Afghanistan, and Ambassadors 
Crocker<Crocker, Ryan<ls-thn-eq> and Wood<Wood, William B.<ls-thn-eq> 
what they need, and Douglas Lute can make sure that happens quickly and 
reliably.

Note: The statement referred to Adm. William J. ``Fox'' Fallon, USN, 
commander, U.S. Central Command; Gen. David H. Petraeus, USA, commanding 
general, Multi-National Force--Iraq; U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan C. 
Crocker; and U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan William B. Wood.
