Remarks at a Holiday Reception for the Special Olympics
December 13, 2001

    The President. Good evening. Good evening, everyone. Laura and I are 
so pleased to welcome you to the White House as we pay tribute to a 
great organization and the really good people behind it.
    In a moment, we will hear from Eunice Kennedy Shriver,<Shriver, 
Eunice Kennedy> who has made the Special Olympics her life's 
work. If you ever had any doubt about how much good that one person can 
bring into the world, look no farther than this kind and gracious lady. 
And she married pretty well, too. [Laughter] Sure glad you're here, 
Sargent. And they've done a good job of raising their family. We are so 
pleased to welcome the--I hate to say the word ``children''--the 
offspring of Sargent<Shriver, Sargent> and Eunice Shriver. 
Obviously, you've done a good job of instilling the sense of public 
service in your children, and they're compassionate people. I 
particularly want to thank Tim<Shriver, Timothy P.> for being 
the president of Special Olympics.
    With us as well is Eunice's little brother--well,<Kennedy, Edward 
M.> younger brother--[laughter]--a man I have grown to admire 
as a fine United States Senator. And Orrin Hatch, another fine Senator, 
is here, as well.<Hatch, Orrin G.> Thank you both for coming.
    I appreciate my Commerce Secretary, Donny Evans,<Evans, Donald 
L.> for being here, and I want to thank the Surgeon General, 
David Satcher,<Satcher, David> for coming, as well.

    I also want to welcome the cochairs of the campaign for the Special 
Olympics, Steve Case<Case, Steve> and Peter Lynch,<Lynch, 
Peter> and all of those who support this fine organization. 
Thank you for coming tonight.
    And the highest title of all is held by the King of the Blues, B.B. 
King.<King, B.B.> Thank you for coming.
    We gather here to celebrate achievement of the Special Olympics, 
itself, and those who compete. Before we lived here, Laura and I were 
fortunate to be involved with the Special Olympics in Texas. And I'll 
never forget being a hugger at Texas Memorial Stadium--such a wonderful 
experience. We're so grateful for the Special Olympics.
    And so is America, because America at its best upholds the values of 
every person and the possibilities of every life. And Special Olympics 
is an example of America at its best, sharing with the entire world a 
spirit of joy and kindness. The story of our country is an ever-widening 
circle, a society in which everyone has a place and everyone has 
something to give. You brought that spirit into the lives of more than a 
million children and adults across the world, and I thank you for that.
    Most of all, I congratulate the global messengers and athletes with 
us this evening: Cindy Bentley,<Bentley, Cindy> Henry 
Moretti,<Moretti, Henry> Mohammad 
Nassar,<Nassar,Mohammad> Jia Sirui,<Jia Sirui> 
Victor Stewart,<Stewart, Victor> Katy Wilson,<Wilson, 
Katy> Loretta Claiborne,<Claiborne, Loretta> and 
Ricardo Thornton.<Thornton, Ricardo> Each one of you has been 
recognized for giving your best, for sharing your many gifts with 
others, and for living out the Special Olympics oath: ``Let me win. But 
if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.'' Each one of you has 
set high goals, and you have met them through hard work and courage.
    We are all so proud to have you with us tonight and ask all of our 
guests to join me in toasting the brave and generous spirit of the 
Special Olympics.

 [At this point, the President offered a toast.]

    The President. And now it is my honor to welcome Mrs. Eunice 
Shriver.<Shriver, Eunice Kennedy>

Note: The President spoke at 7:47 p.m. on the State Floor at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder 
and honorary chairman, Sargent Shriver, chairman of the board, and their 
son Timothy P. Shriver, president and chief executive officer, Special 
Olympics; and Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
