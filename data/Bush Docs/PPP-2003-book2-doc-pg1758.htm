Remarks in a Visit With Angel Tree Children in Alexandria, Virginia
December 22, 2003

    The President. Hey everybody.
    Rev. Lee A. Earl.<Earl, Lee A.<ls-thn-eq> Mr. President.
    The President. Thank you very much, Reverend Lee.<Earl, Lee 
A.<ls-thn-eq> Thank you so much for having us here. Lee, thank you very 
much. Merry Christmas to everybody.
    Audience members. Merry Christmas.
    The President. We are so honored to be here to celebrate the Angel 
Tree Christmas. This is a program in which people who love you a lot 
want you to have a merry Christmas. And I want to thank you. I want to 
thank Chuck Colson<Colson, Charles W.<ls-thn-eq> and Mark Earley<Earley, 
Mark<ls-thn-eq> of the Prison Fellowship program, which has been hosting 
and organizing the Angel Tree program since 1982. Six million boys and 
girls have received a gift on Christmas, and I want to thank you very 
much for doing that.
    Our attitude is--I know that the reverend<Earl, Lee A.<ls-thn-eq> 
here at Shiloh shares this attitude--that we change America one heart 
and one soul at a time; that everybody matters, everybody counts; that 
every child has got a hopeful and bright future; and each of us has a 
responsibility of loving that child with all our heart and all our soul. 
And it's important that all of us during this time of--joyous time, this 
holiday, recognize that probably the greatest gift you can possibly give 
is to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself.
    And that's what we're doing today. We're honoring that call to love 
and the call to service. And so Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are 
thrilled that you're here. We look forward to joining the good 
reverend<Earl, Lee A.<ls-thn-eq> here as we pass out some of the gifts 
to the boys and girls.
    Reverend Earl.<Earl, Lee A.<ls-thn-eq> Absolutely. And thank you for 
the gifts that you've provided.
    The President. Well, thank you very much. We're honored to be here.
    We want to wish you a merry Christmas, and we've got some gifts to 
give out. Don't we, Laura?<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq>
    The First Lady.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> Yes, we have a lot of gifts 
to give out.
    The President. Where do we want to start?
    The First Lady.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> I don't know where to start. 
[Laughter]
    The President. Right over here? Okay, good.

Note: The President spoke at 3:20 p.m. at the Shiloh Baptist Church. In 
his remarks, he referred to Rev. Lee A. Earl, senior pastor, Shiloh 
Baptist Church; and Charles W.
