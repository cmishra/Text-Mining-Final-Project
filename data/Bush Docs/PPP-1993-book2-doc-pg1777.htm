Nomination for an Assistant Secretary of Energy
October 19, 1993

    The President announced his intention to nominate Christine Ervin, 
currently director of the Oregon department of energy, to be Assistant 
Secretary of Energy for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
    ``We must expand our efforts to use energy more efficiently and to 
develop new, renewable sources of energy,'' said the President. ``Having 
an Assistant Secretary of Energy with Christine Ervin's wide range of 
experience will help us to move that process forward.''
