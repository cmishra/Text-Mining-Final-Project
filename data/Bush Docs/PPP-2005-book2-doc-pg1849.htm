Statement on the Death of Gebran Tueni<Tueni, Gebran Ghassan<ls-thn-eq>
December 12, 2005

    The murder of Gebran Tueni, a Lebanese patriot, Member of 
Parliament, and publisher of one of Lebanon's leading newspapers, is yet 
another act of violence aimed at subjugating Lebanon to Syrian 
domination and silencing the Lebanese press. Mr. Tueni was a well-known 
opponent of Syrian interference in Lebanon. Like so many other brave 
Lebanese, Mr. Tueni knew that his courageous stand on behalf of 
Lebanon's independence and freedom carried great risk. Despite these 
dangers to his life, he returned to Lebanon a day before his 
assassination to continue his efforts to promote freedom and democracy 
in his country.
    I strongly condemn the savage attack on Mr. Tueni and extend my 
condolences to his family and the families of the other innocent victims 
killed in Lebanon. Syria must comply with United Nations Security 
Council Resolutions 1559, 1595, and 1636 and end its interference in 
Lebanon once and for all.
