Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency
With Respect to UNITA
August 17, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (``UNITA'') is to 
continue in effect beyond September 26, 1994, to the Federal Register 
for publication.
    The circumstances that led to the declaration on September 26, 1993, 
of a national emergency have not been resolved. The actions and policies 
of UNITA pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the

United States. United Nations Security Council Resolution 864 (1993) 
continues to oblige all Members States to maintain sanctions. 
Discontinuation of the sanctions would have a prejudicial effect on the 
Angolan peace process. For these reasons, I have determined that it is 
necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities necessary to apply 
economic pressure to UNITA to reduce its ability to pursue its 
aggressive policies of territorial acquisition.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
August 17, 1994.

Note: The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
