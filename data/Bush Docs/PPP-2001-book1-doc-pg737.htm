Statement on Proposed Patients' Bill of Rights Legislation
June 27, 2001

    The bipartisan proposal introduced today by Representatives Ernie 
Fletcher,<Fletcher, Ernie<ls-thn-eq> Collin Peterson,<Peterson, Collin 
C.<ls-thn-eq> Nancy Johnson,<Johnson, Nancy L.<ls-thn-eq> and Richard 
Burr,<Burr, Richard<ls-thn-eq> along with Speaker Hastert<Hastert, J. 
Dennis<ls-thn-eq> and the chairmen of the three committees with 
jurisdiction, Chairmen Boehner,<Boehner, John A.<ls-thn-eq> 
Tauzin,<Tauzin, W.J. ``Billy''<ls-thn-eq> and Thomas,<Thomas, William 
M.<ls-thn-eq> makes progress in our effort to provide patients with a 
strong and enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.
    This proposal, like the legislation introduced by Senators 
Frist,<Frist, Bill<ls-thn-eq> Breaux,<Breaux, John B.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Jeffords,<Jeffords, James M.<ls-thn-eq> is another example of a 
Patients' Bill of Rights that reflects the principles I laid out earlier 
this year. I am encouraged that the bill introduced today brings us 
significantly closer to enacting a good Patients' Bill of Rights.
    This legislation provides strong patient protections to all 
Americans. It ensures that patients have the right to an independent 
medical review when they have been denied medical care, and it holds 
health plans accountable by providing patients with meaningful, 
effective remedies when they have been harmed by a denial or delay in 
receiving such care.
    I am committed to providing patients with expanded remedies to hold 
their health plans accountable and believe we can do so while protecting 
workers and

their families from costly litigation that would increase health care 
premiums and leave too many Americans without health insurance. This 
legislation introduced today provides patients with meaningful remedies 
while preserving uniformity and certainty for employers who voluntarily 
offer health care benefits for millions of Americans across the country.
