Nomination for Posts at the Commerce and Transportation Departments
July 9, 1993

    The President has announced his intention to nominate David Barram 
to the position of Deputy Secretary at the Department of Commerce and 
Steve Palmer to be Assistant Secretary for Governmental Affairs at the 
Department of Transportation.
    ``These appointments are a continuation of our efforts to nominate 
accomplished and dedicated professionals to important Government 
positions,'' the President said.
    The President said that Mr. Barram's private sector experience will 
be a valuable asset at the Commerce Department. ``His professional 
background combined with his extensive community service will add an 
important perspective.''
    ``Steve Palmer,'' said the President, ``has lengthy experience in 
Federal Government which makes him especially qualified for this post.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
