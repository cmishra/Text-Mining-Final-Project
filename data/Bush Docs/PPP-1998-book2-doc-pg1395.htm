Statement on the Death of Arthur Barbieri
August 4, 1998

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened by the death of Arthur Barbieri. 
New Haven has lost a great political leader; I have lost a mentor and a 
friend.
    When I was a law student, I was lucky enough to work by Arthur's 
side and learn grassroots politics at its absolute best. I'm forever 
grateful for all that he taught me. Our thoughts and prayers are with 
his loved ones.
