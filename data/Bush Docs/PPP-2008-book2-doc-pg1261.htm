Message on the Observance of Eid al-Fitr
September 30, 2008

    I send greetings to Muslims everywhere celebrating Eid al-Fitr, the 
Festival of Breaking the Fast.
    During the three-day festival of Eid al-Fitr, Muslims celebrate the 
completion of their fast and the blessings of a renewed faith. On this 
special occasion, families and friends around the globe gather to share 
traditional foods and congratulate each other on meeting the test of 
Ramadan.
    Our Nation has millions of citizens who practice Islam, and our 
country benefits from their many contributions. This holiday is also an 
opportunity for Muslims to reflect on Islam's vibrant culture, which has 
enriched civilization for centuries.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes. Eid 
Mubarak.

                                                          George W. Bush
