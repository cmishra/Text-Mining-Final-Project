Statement on the Death of John White
January 20, 1995

    Hillary and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of former 
Democratic National Committee Chairman John White. Our prayers are with 
Nellie and his family at this difficult time. I am proud to have had the 
opportunity to work with him and learn from him. His decency, 
perseverance, and humor are a model for all of us who face the 
challenges and possibilities within our political system to move ideas 
forward and improve people's lives. John dedicated his life in service 
to the Democratic Party and this Nation. As Democrats gather from across 
the country to formally elect new leadership this weekend, memories of 
his sharp wit and tireless commitment will be in our hearts.
