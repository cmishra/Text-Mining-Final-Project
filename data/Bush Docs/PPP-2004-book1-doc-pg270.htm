Progress of NATO Invitees Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, 
Slovakia, and Slovenia
February 26, 2004

Dear _____ :
    Consistent with Condition 3(2)(A) of the Senate resolution of advice 
and consent to ratification to the Protocols to the North Atlantic 
Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, passed on May 8, 2003, I am providing a 
report prepared by my Administration.
    This report describes the progress of the seven NATO invitees in 
satisfying the security sector and security vetting requirements for 
membership in NATO. As the report makes clear, all seven satisfy these 
NATO requirements.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Pat Roberts, chairman, and John D. 
Rockefeller IV, vice chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 
and Porter J. Goss, chairman, and Jane Harman, vice chairman, House 
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
