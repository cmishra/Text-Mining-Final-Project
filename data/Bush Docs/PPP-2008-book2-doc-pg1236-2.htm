Statement on Provincial Elections Legislation in Iraq
September 24, 2008

    Today Iraq's parliament passed a Provincial elections law enabling 
Iraq to hold Provincial elections by January 31, 2009. Elections in Iraq 
can now be held under a new system that will give Iraqis more say in 
choosing their elected representatives.

    Nothing is more central to a functioning democracy than free and 
fair elections. Today's action demonstrates the ability of Iraq's 
leaders to work together for the good of the Iraqi people and represents 
further progress on political reconciliation. I congratulate the members 
of the Iraqi Council of Representatives for coming together to pass this 
significant legislation.
