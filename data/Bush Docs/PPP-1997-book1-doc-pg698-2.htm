Certain Former Eastern Bloc States

To the Congress of the United States:
    I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies 
of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine as required by 
subsections 402(b) and 409(b) of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (the ``Act''). I have determined that Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine are in full compliance with subsections 
402(a) and 409(a) of the Act. As required by title IV, I will provide 
the Congress with periodic reports regarding the compliance of Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine with these emigration 
standards.

                                                      William J. Clinton
