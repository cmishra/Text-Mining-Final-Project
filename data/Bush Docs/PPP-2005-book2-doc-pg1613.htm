Message to the Senate Transmitting the Bangladesh-United States Taxation 
Convention
October 27, 2005

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification a Convention Between the Government of the United States of 
America and the Government of Bangladesh for the Avoidance of Double 
Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on 
Income signed at Dhaka on September 26, 2004 (the ``Convention''). An 
exchange of notes is enclosed, and the report of the Department of State 
with respect to the Convention is transmitted for the information of the 
Senate.
    This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United 
States and other developing nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be 
applied to various types of income and protection from double taxation 
of income. The Convention also provides for the resolution of disputes 
and sets forth rules making its benefits unavailable to those who are 
engaged in treaty forum shopping.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to 
ratification.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 October 27, 2005.
