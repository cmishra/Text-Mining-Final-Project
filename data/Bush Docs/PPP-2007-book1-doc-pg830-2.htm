Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Waiver on the Extension 
of Normal Trade Relations Status for Turkmenistan
June 28, 2007

Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)
    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(c)(2) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to a waiver of the 
application of subsections 402(a) and (b) of that Act to Turkmenistan.
    I report in that document my determination that such a waiver will 
substantially promote the objectives of section 402. I have instructed 
the Secretary of State to provide a copy of that determination to the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. 
The report also indicates that I have received assurances with respect 
to the emigration practices of Turkmenistan required by section 
402(c)(2)(B) of the Act.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on June 29. The 
related Executive order and Presidential determination of June 28 are 
listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
