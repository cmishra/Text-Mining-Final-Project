Statement on the Agreement on Elections in South Africa
April 19, 1994

    I warmly welcome today's agreement among the South African 
Government, the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party 
to renounce violence and to bring Inkatha into the nation's first non-
racial elections next week. Throughout the historic process of change in 
South Africa, the leaders of that country have shown great courage and a 
capacity for compromise. Today's bold action by Chief Buthelezi, Nelson 
Mandela, and F.W. de Klerk is one more act of collective statesmanship 
that bodes well for the prospect of free and fair elections in South 
Africa and for the success of the future Government of National Unity.
    What happens in South Africa is of vital importance to us all. South 
Africa has the potential to alter the world trend toward greater ethnic 
division and establish a powerful model for democratic reform and 
national reconciliation. We will remain steadfast in our support for 
South Africa as it makes this difficult and historic transition to 
nonracial democracy.
