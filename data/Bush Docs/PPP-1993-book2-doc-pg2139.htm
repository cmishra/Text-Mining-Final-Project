Statement on Appointment of Assistant to the President and         
Deputy Chief of Staff
December 7, 1993

    I've known Phil for a long time and believe that his integrity, 
personal qualities, and record of management success will be a genuine 
asset to the White House.

Note: This statement was included in a White House announcement naming 
Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director for Management Philip 
Lader as Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff.
