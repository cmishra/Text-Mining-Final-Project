Statement on the Death of Simon Wiesenthal<Wiesenthal, Simon<ls-thn-eq>
September 20, 2005

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are saddened by the death of 
Simon Wiesenthal, a tireless and passionate advocate who devoted his 
life to tracking down Nazi killers and promoting freedom. Simon 
Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives in the Holocaust, yet he survived the death 
camps himself. He gathered intelligence to be used in war crimes trials 
and also passed on important information that led to the conviction of 
Adolf Eichmann. Throughout his long career, he relentlessly pursued 
those responsible for some of the most horrific crimes against humanity 
the world has ever known. Simon Wiesenthal fought for justice, and 
history will always remember him.
