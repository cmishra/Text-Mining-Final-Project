Statement on Releasing Funds Under the Low Income Home Energy Assistance 
Program
July 12, 1999

  In much of our Nation, the early part of summer has brought a chance 
to explore the outdoors or enjoy a day at the beach or lake. But in 
large parts of the eastern United States, these first weeks of summer 
have brought record high temperatures, extreme discomfort, and for some, 
severe danger.
    Up and down the eastern seaboard, and as far west as Michigan, 
temperatures over the past 2 weeks soared to levels more than 30 percent 
higher than average for this time of year. Temperatures that hit the 
nineties and beyond can pose grave risks to the elderly, the very young,

the disabled, and the ill. Tragically, this heat wave has already 
claimed the lives of more than 100 people.
    Today I am releasing $100 million to help low income Americans in 
the affected areas cope with this terrible and life-threatening heat. 
These funds will help victims of the heat wave pay for the costs 
associated with home cooling, so that they are able to purchase air 
conditioners and fans and pay their electricity bills.
    These resources will help protect the most vulnerable among us as 
the current heat wave runs its course.
