Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Amendments
May 6, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 2005 budget 
amendments for the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education, 
Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, 
Labor, and the Treasury; the Corps of Engineers; the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. In addition, I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed FY 
2004 language proposals for the Departments of Health and Human Services 
and the Treasury. Overall, the discretionary
budget authority proposed in my FY 2005 Budget would not be increased by 
these requests.
    This transmittal also contains FY 2005 budget amendments for the 
legislative branch. As a matter of comity, appropriations requests of 
the legislative branch are commonly transmitted without change.
    The details of these proposals are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
