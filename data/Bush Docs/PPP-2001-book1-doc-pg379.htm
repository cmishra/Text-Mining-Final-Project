Statement on the Helicopter Crash in Vietnam
April 7, 2001

    Laura and I were deeply saddened to learn of the crash this morning 
in central Vietnam of a helicopter carrying 16 people, including 7 U.S. 
military personnel, who were on an important mission to find and recover 
the remains of servicemen missing from the Vietnam war. The families of 
the service personnel lost in today's tragic accident know better than 
most the contribution their loved ones made in bringing closure to 
scores of families across America. Today's loss is a terrible one for 
our Nation. Although not lost in a hostile act, like those for whom they 
search, they too have lived lives of great consequence, answering a 
calling of service to their fellow citizens. As we enter a period of 
religious holidays across America, may we remember their sacrifice and 
keep them and their families in our thoughts and prayers.
