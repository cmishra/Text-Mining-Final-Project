Remarks Following Discussions With Religious Leaders in Istanbul, Turkey
June 27, 2004

    All right. It has been my honor to welcome these very important 
leaders of different faiths to this dialog. They represent the very best 
of Turkey, which is a country that is secular in politics and strong in 
its faith. And we've had a wonderful discussion. I'm so honored that 
these leaders would take time and share their thoughts with me. And I 
welcome them, and I thank them for being so faithful to the Almighty 
God.
    Thank you for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 4:55 p.m. at the Hilton Istanbul. A tape 
was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
