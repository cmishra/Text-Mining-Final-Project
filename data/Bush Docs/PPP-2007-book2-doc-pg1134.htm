Statement on the Situation in Burma
August 30, 2007

    I strongly condemn the ongoing actions of the Burmese regime in 
arresting, harassing, and assaulting prodemocracy activists for 
organizing or participating in peaceful demonstrations. These activists 
were voicing concerns about recent dramatic increases in the price of 
fuel, and their concerns should be listened to by the regime rather than 
silenced through force.
    The Burmese regime should heed the international calls to release 
these activists immediately and stop its intimidation of those Burmese 
citizens who are promoting democracy and human rights. I also call on 
the regime to release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu 
Kyi,<Aung San Suu Kyi<ls-thn-eq> and to lift restrictions on 
humanitarian organizations that seek to help the people of Burma.
