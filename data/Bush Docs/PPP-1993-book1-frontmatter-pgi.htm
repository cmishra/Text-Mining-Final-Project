                                Foreword

    In my inaugural address, I declared: ``Our democracy must be not 
only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is 
nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with 
America.''

    In the first 6 months of our Administration, we called upon 
America's historic strengths to revitalize the economy, restore the 
middle class, rebuild our national security for a new era, and renew the 
people's sense of national community and their faith in public 
institutions.

    We built upon the entrepreneurial energy of our free enterprise 
system with an economic plan that cut the Federal deficit, invested in 
our workers' skills, expanded college opportunity for the sons and 
daughters of the middle class, rewarded the efforts of the working poor, 
and helped businesses expand and create new jobs. We strengthened 
American families with the Family and Medical Leave Act, which helps 
Americans be good parents and good workers. We enhanced America's world 
leadership with efforts to open foreign markets, ensure the readiness of 
our military forces, promote democracy abroad, preserve our planet's 
natural environment, and advance regional security in Europe, Asia, the 
Mideast, and throughout the world. We strengthened America's sense of 
community with initiatives here at home to encourage young people to 
serve their country, to protect our people from violent crime and drug 
abuse, and to reinvent government to make it reflect American values. 
And we began the work of preserving what is right, and fixing what is 
wrong, with America's health care system.

    Most of all, this volume is a testimonial to those who embody what 
is best about America, the citizens of our country. The American people 
called for the changes chronicled in this volume; they held the 
President and the Congress accountable for achieving these changes; and, 
in countless actions in their own lives--from raising their children 
with values of responsibility and faith to helping to keep their own 
neighborhoods safe from crime and violence--they are continuing the work 
of renewing our democracy.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period January 20-July 31, 1993. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush are 
also available.
