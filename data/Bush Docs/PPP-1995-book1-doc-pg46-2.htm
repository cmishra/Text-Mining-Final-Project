Statement on Bilateral Investment Treaties With Albania and Latvia
January 13, 1995

    These bilateral investment treaties put in place a strong foundation 
for expanded U.S. trade and investment with the reforming democracies of 
Central and Eastern Europe. They are another step toward integrating 
Europe's new democracies with an expanding transatlantic community. 
Americans and Central Europeans alike will benefit through the increased 
business.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the signing of the treaties.
