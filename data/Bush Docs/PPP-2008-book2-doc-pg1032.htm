Statement on Senate Passage of Legislation To Reauthorize the 
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief
July 16, 2008

    I thank the Senate for the strong, bipartisan vote today to pass 
important, lifesaving legislation reauthorizing the President's 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). I appreciate the efforts of 
Majority Leader Reid,<Reid, Harry<ls-thn-eq> Senators Biden<Biden, 
Joseph R., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and Lugar,<Lugar, Richard G.<ls-thn-eq> and 
all other Senators from both sides of the aisle who came together today 
to ensure that America's generosity in battling HIV/AIDS, malaria, and 
other diseases around the globe will continue in a manner consistent 
with the program's successful founding principles.
    When we launched this program in 2003, about 50,000 people in sub-
Saharan Africa were receiving antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS. 
Today, PEPFAR supports lifesaving antiretroviral treatment for more than 
1.7 million people around the world. PEPFAR has also supported treatment 
and prevention programs that have helped HIV-positive women give birth 
to nearly 200,000 infants who are HIV-free. PEPFAR is the largest 
international health initiative in history to fight a single disease.
    Traveling in Africa earlier this year, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> 
and I had our most recent opportunity to witness the effectiveness of 
this program. We were honored to see the doctors, nurses, and caregivers 
of all faiths working to save the lives of their fellow citizens. And we 
met the patients, including many children, who understand and appreciate 
America's generosity.
    With passage of today's bill, we are one step closer to ensuring 
that this excellent program continues to help those in need. I encourage 
the full Congress to move quickly to send me final legislation that I 
can sign.
