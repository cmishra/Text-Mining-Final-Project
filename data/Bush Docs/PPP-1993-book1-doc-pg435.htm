Appointment of White House Liaison to the Metropolitan Washington 
Council of Governments
April 14, 1993

    The President has named Loretta Avent, his Special Assistant for 
Intergovernmental Affairs, to be the White House Liaison to the 
Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the White House 
announced today.
    ``Too often in the past, the Federal Government has not been a very 
good neighbor to the rest of the Washington area,'' said the President. 
``I am committed to changing that relationship and have full confidence 
in Loretta's ability to act effectively to make the White House a full 
partner in the affairs of the region where we live.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
