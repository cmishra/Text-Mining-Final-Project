Remarks on Election Day in Crawford, Texas
November 7, 2006

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I know it's a privilege to be able 
to cast our vote, and I encourage all Americans to vote today.
    We live in a free society, and our Government is only as good as the 
willingness of our people to participate in it. And therefore, no matter 
what your party affiliation or if you don't have a party affiliation, do 
your duty: Cast your ballot, and let your voice be heard. So we thank 
you for being a good citizen. It's good to be here voting in Texas. 
We're going to be heading back up to Washington here pretty soon and 
watch the results.
    Appreciate it. Thank you all.

Note: The President spoke at 7:10 a.m. at the Crawford Fire Station. The 
Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language 
transcript of these remarks.
