Statement on the Oklahoma City Bombing Trial
June 13, 1997

    Since there is another trial pending, I cannot comment on the jury's 
decision.
    But on behalf of all Americans, I thank the jurors for their 
deliberations and their thoroughness as they made these grave decisions. 
This investigation and trial have confirmed our country's faith in its 
justice system.
    To the victims and their families, I know that your healing can be 
measured only one day at a time. The prayers and support of your fellow 
Americans will be with you every one of those days.
