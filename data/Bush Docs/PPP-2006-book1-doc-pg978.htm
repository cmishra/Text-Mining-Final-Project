Statement on the Formation of Iraq's Government
May 20, 2006

    I congratulate Prime Minister Maliki<Maliki, Nuri al-<ls-thn-eq> on 
the formation of Iraq's new unity Government. Iraqis now have a fully 
constitutional government, marking the end of a democratic transitional 
process in Iraq that has been both difficult and inspiring. This broadly 
representative unity Government offers a new opportunity for progress in 
Iraq.
    The new Government reflects Iraq's diversity and opens a new chapter 
in that country's history. Iraq's new leaders know the period ahead will 
be filled with great challenge. But they also know that they and their 
great country will not face them alone. The United States and freedom-
loving nations around the world will stand with Iraq as it takes its 
place among the world's democracies and as an ally in the war on terror.
    Today, as Iraqis look to their new Government, they can be proud 
that in 3 years, they have progressed from the oppression of a brutal 
dictator<Hussein, Saddam<ls-thn-eq> who fomented sectarian divides to an 
elected government in which all Iraqis have a voice. As Iraq's leaders 
work together to chart the future of their nation, bringing freedom and 
security to the Iraqi people, they make the world a safer place for all 
of us. The sacrifices of many of our country's noblest and bravest have 
helped make this day possible. We will not forget their contribution to 
our security and Iraq's democracy.
