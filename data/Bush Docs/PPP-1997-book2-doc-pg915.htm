Statement on the Resignation of Ambassador Molly Raiser as Chief of 
Protocol
July 3, 1997

    It is with great sadness that I accepted today Ambassador Molly 
Raiser's resignation as Chief of Protocol, effective July 24. But it is 
with even greater thanks and pride that I look back upon her years of 
service and the extraordinary job she has done to ensure effective 
American engagement in the world.
    No one knows better than Ambassador Raiser the amount of planning 
and the attention to detail that goes into our Nation's foreign policy. 
And no one has done more to make the conduct of that policy 
professional, precise, and smooth. From the war-torn streets of Sarajevo 
to Denver's gleaming city center, Ambassador Raiser brought elegance and 
energy to the business of foreign affairs and set a standard for all who 
worked with her. She made foreign guests feel welcome when they visited 
the United States and helped me feel at home whenever I traveled abroad. 
She represented me and the interests of our Nation with insight, 
judgment, and grace.
    I extend Ambassador Raiser my warmest thanks for a job well done, 
and wish her every possible success in all her future endeavors.
