Letter Accepting the Resignation of David Watkins as Assistant to the 
President for Management and Administration
May 27, 1994

Dear David:
    I write to accept your resignation and to say that I understand your 
reasons for submitting it.
    At the same time, it should be stated that you undertook your 
assignment as Assistant to the President for Management and 
Administration with great vigor and effectiveness. During your tenure, 
we changed and upgraded the technology upon which this White House 
depends and future White Houses will depend; from telephones to 
computers, you brought us into the modern age. Moreover, you opened this 
house--the people's house--literally to thousands more visitors than had 
ever been welcomed here in White House history. For these, and many 
other accomplishments large and small, you deserve great credit.
    Hillary and I will never forget the loyal friendship you and Ileene 
have given to us over the years.
    Sincerely,

                                                                    Bill

Note: A letter of resignation from David Watkins to the President and a 
letter from Chief of Staff Thomas F. (Mack) McLarty to Mr. Watkins were 
also made available by the Office of the Press Secretary.
