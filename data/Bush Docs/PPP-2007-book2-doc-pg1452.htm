Statement on Senate Confirmation of Michael B. Mukasey<Mukasey, Michael 
B.<ls-thn-eq> as Attorney General
November 8, 2007

    I thank the Senate for its bipartisan vote confirming Judge Michael 
Mukasey as the Nation's 81st Attorney General. Judge Mukasey is a man of 
strong character and integrity with exceptional legal judgment. He was 
an accomplished prosecutor and, for more than 18 years, a distinguished 
Federal judge. Now he will be an outstanding Attorney General.
    Judge Mukasey's confirmation comes at a critical moment for the 
Justice Department and for our Nation. As Attorney General, Judge 
Mukasey will lead the Justice Department as it works to protect the 
American people, whether from drug traffickers and other criminals on 
our streets or from terrorists who seek to attack our homeland.
    Now that Judge Mukasey has been confirmed, I look forward to working 
with the Senate to fill the other senior leadership positions at the 
Justice Department so that America has the strongest, most capable 
national security team during this time of war.
