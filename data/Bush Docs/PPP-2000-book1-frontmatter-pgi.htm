                                Foreword

    At the dawn of a new millennium, America paused to celebrate its 
remarkable achievements and quickly set out to build an even better 
future. Employers and entrepreneurs created another 2 million new jobs, 
continuing to fuel what in February became the longest economic 
expansion in American history. With unemployment hitting a 30-year low, 
wages rose across the board, inflation held steady, and we paid off a 
record $133 billion in public debt.

    We also worked to widen the circle of opportunity, so that all 
people might acquire the skills they need to prosper in our new economy. 
As part of our New Markets Initiative, I visited East Palo Alto, 
California, and the Navajo Nation in New Mexico, highlighting our 
efforts to spread the benefits of new technologies to hard-pressed 
communities. To help close the digital divide, we opened the first of 
1,000 Community Technology Centers across the country, so that Americans 
from all walks of life might tap the power of the Internet.

    In a major scientific breakthrough, researchers completed their 
first map of the human genome, the complex genetic blueprint of human 
life. This milestone holds great promise for revolutionary medical 
treatments, but also raises the possibility of genetic discrimination. 
To combat this specter, I issued an Executive Order banning the use of 
genetic information to discriminate against Federal employees, an 
important first step in our effort to protect all Americans from similar 
discrimination.

    As part of an ongoing effort to strengthen ties between the world's 
oldest democracy, the United States, and its biggest, India, I traveled 
to South Asia. There, I urged India and Pakistan to end their nuclear 
arms race and resume negotiations toward a permanent peace. We also 
continued to push for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. And at a 
Moscow summit, we renewed our commitment to blocking the proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction and explored further steps to reduce our 
nuclear arsenals.

    At the World Economic Summit in Switzerland, I urged leaders to help 
make sure that globalization benefits workers and the environment. We 
continued to build a global coalition for debt relief in the developing 
world and to fund vaccines and treatments that could eliminate the 
ravages of AIDS and other deadly diseases. And in Germany, I was humbled 
to become the first American President to receive the Charlemagne Prize, 
awarded for America's contributions to peace and integration in Europe.

    We worked hard for peace at home, too--especially in our continuing 
efforts to reduce gun violence. We kept pushing the Congress to support 
sensible gun safety legislation and funding for more gun prosecutors--
issues at the heart of the Million Mom March on Mother's Day.

    Despite substantial congressional opposition, we continued to push 
for the passage of both a strong Patients' Bill of Rights and a Medicare 
prescription drug benefit that would help older Americans afford costly 
prescriptions.

    We also worked hard to protect our natural heritage. We created new 
national monuments to safeguard the Grand Canyon and the Giant Sequoias 
of California and proposed permanent conservation funding to ensure that 
America's greatest natural treasures will forever endure. To combat 
global warming, we proposed the Clean Air Partnership Fund to reduce 
greenhouse gases and air pollution and outlined tax incentives for 
developing cleaner engines and renewable energy sources. We also 
dedicated more funding to climate change research.

    With the strong support of the American people, our Nation got off 
to a strong start in the new century. We built upon our past successes 
and made smart investments for the future. If we continue to work hard, 
honor our values, and make wise choices together, America will indeed 
flourish as never before.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period January 1-June 27, 2000. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush are 
also included in the Public Papers series.
