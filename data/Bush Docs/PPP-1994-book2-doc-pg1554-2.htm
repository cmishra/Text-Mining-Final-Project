Message to the Senate Transmitting the Sweden-United States
Taxation Convention
September 14, 1994

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America 
and the Government of Sweden for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and 
the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income signed 
at Stockholm on September 1, 1994, together with a related exchange of 
notes. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report 
of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.
    The proposed Convention with Sweden replaces the present income tax 
regime between the two countries. In general, the proposed Convention 
follows the pattern of other recent U.S. income tax treaties and the 
1981 U.S. Model Income Tax Convention, as well as the OECD Model Tax 
Convention on Income and Capital.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Convention and the related exchange of notes and give its advice 
and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
September 14, 1994.
