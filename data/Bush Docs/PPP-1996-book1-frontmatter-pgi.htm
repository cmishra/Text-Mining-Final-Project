                                Foreword

    In 1996, our Nation strived to make the American dream a reality for 
all who would work for it, to continue as the world's strongest force 
for peace, freedom, and democracy, and to build a stronger country.

    In my State of the Union Address, I discussed the age of possibility 
in which we live and issued seven challenges to the country: strengthen 
families, improve education, enhance economic security, preserve our 
natural environment, fight against crime and drugs, maintain our world 
leadership, and reinvent Government. I said we would meet these 
challenges by working in partnership with all of our citizens, through 
State and local governments, in the workplace, in religious, charitable, 
and civic associations. The era of big government is over, yet we cannot 
go back to the time when our citizens were left to fend for themselves. 
We must give all our people the tools to make the most of their own 
lives.

    During the first half of the year, I worked to enable the American 
people to meet these challenges--by helping those communities that 
wanted to instill discipline in young people through community curfews, 
school uniforms, and truancy enforcement; by handing the television 
remote control back to parents through the v-chip and a television 
ratings system; and by calling upon the tobacco industry to stop the 
massive marketing campaigns that appeal to children. In all the actions 
I took, my paramount goal was to help families meet their 
responsibilities, and succeed both at home and at work.

    During this period, I also worked beyond our borders to advance our 
Nation's interests in security and prosperity. At a special summit in 
Moscow, President Yeltsin and I took important steps to reduce the 
threat of nuclear weapons. With our partners in Japan and South Korea, 
we strengthened our military alliances and our common efforts to 
increase economic growth for the future. In the wake of a series of 
terrorist attacks in the Middle East, I traveled to Egypt for a landmark 
``Summit of the Peacemakers'' that the United States co-hosted, bringing 
together an unprecedented number of regional leaders who are committed 
to building peace with security. We also saw, once again, that our 
global leadership can impose great sacrifice. Americans felt tremendous 
sorrow after the tragic death of my friend, Commerce Secretary Ron 
Brown. That loss strengthened our determination to continue his mission 
so that economic reconstruction goes forward in the Balkans and peace 
takes hold.

    In a series of commencement addresses, I set forth the challenges 
that I believed our country faced as it approached the new century, 
culminating in the national goal, announced at Princeton University, of 
making the 13th and 14th years of education--the first two years of 
college--as universal as high school is today. To meet that goal, I 
proposed a Hope Scholarship tax credit to help every American get the 
education he or she needs.

    This was a time when America began to regain its self-confidence, 
coming together around shared national goals, and realizing that when we 
work together, we can act--and act effectively--to meet our challenges 
and protect our values.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period January 1-June 30, 1996. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush are 
also available.
