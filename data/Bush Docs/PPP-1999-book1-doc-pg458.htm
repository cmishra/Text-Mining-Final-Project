Radio Remarks on Emergency Farm Measures
March 26, 1999

    Today I have directed Secretary Glickman<Glickman, Dan> to 
take immediate measures to provide urgently needed resources to our 
Nation's farmers as they enter the spring planting season. I asked 
Congress to pass emergency funding of $150 million to provide more than 
$1 billion in loans for farmers and ranchers. Unfortunately, Congress 
did not complete action before leaving for

a 2-week recess, in spite of the fact that many of our Government's 
critical emergency farm loan programs are set to run out of funds in the 
next several weeks.
    Therefore, I am taking this immediate stop-gap measure so that our 
farmers, who face continuing low crop prices and difficulty in securing 
private loans, will be able to finance spring planting. This action will 
make more than $300 million in loans available to farmers and ranchers. 
I urge Congress when it returns from its recess to move immediately on 
our emergency request for funds for farm loans.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at approximately 12:30 p.m. 
in the Oval Office at the White House for later broadcast. These remarks 
were also made available on the White House Press Office Radio Actuality 
Line.
