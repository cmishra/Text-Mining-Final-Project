Statement on Congressional Action on Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations Legislation To Address the September 11 Terrorist Attacks
September 14, 2001

    I am gratified that the Congress has united so powerfully by taking 
this action. It sends a clear message--our people are together, and we 
will prevail.
