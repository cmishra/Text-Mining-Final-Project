Statement on the Conclusion of the Independent Counsel's Investigation 
of Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt<Babbitt, Bruce>
October 13, 1999

    I am very pleased by today's announcement concerning Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt. As I said at the beginning of this inquiry, 
Bruce Babbitt is a man of the highest integrity, and I was convinced 
that he would be vindicated. Secretary Babbitt's record of superb 
stewardship of our Nation's lands speaks for itself, and I look forward 
to his continuing service to our country, its people, and its 
extraordinary God-given resources.
