Statement on Withdrawal of the Nomination of Zoe Baird To Be Attorney 
General
January 22, 1993

    Tonight I received a letter from my Attorney-General-designate, Ms. 
Zoe Baird, asking that I withdraw her nomination to lead the United 
States Department of Justice from further consideration by the Senate.
    Ms. Baird is a gifted attorney and a woman of decency and integrity. 
She responded to the call to public service with energy and a firm 
dedication to the mission of the Justice Department. Her candid 
disclosure of the child care matter to officials of my transition and to 
the Senate Judiciary Committee led to the circumstances we face today.
    Clearly, our review process prior to her selection failed to 
evaluate this issue completely. For that, I take full responsibility. I 
hold Zoe Baird in the highest regard, and I believe she has much to give 
to her profession and to our country. I hope to continue to seek her 
advice and counsel. With sadness, I have accepted her request that the 
nomination be withdrawn and have so informed the Senate majority leader, 
George Mitchell.
