Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Education Reform Plan
January 23, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Enclosed please find my blueprint for nationwide education reform 
entitled, ``No Child Left Behind.'' I look forward to working with the 
Congress to ensure that these principles are turned into acceptable 
legislation that leaves no child behind.
        Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. This letter was released on the White House Web site.
