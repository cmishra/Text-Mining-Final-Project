Statement on the White House Conference on Travel and Tourism
June 23, 1994

    The travel and tourism industry is one of the unsung heroes of our 
economy. Your businesses employ more than 6 million Americans and, 
equally important, international tourism is one sector of our economy 
that consistently generates a trade surplus. The White House Conference 
on Travel and Tourism will provide you and your colleagues an 
opportunity to meet with leaders in the executive branch and in Congress 
and, I hope, to develop a shared vision, both of the industry's future 
and of the role of the industry in our Nation's future.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the November 1995 conference.
