Statement on the Commissioning of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium
November 28, 2001

    I congratulate Russia, Kazakhstan, and Oman, and their consortium 
partners for the commissioning of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC). 
U.S. firms, notably ChevronTexaco and ExxonMobil, have played leading 
roles in this project. These facilities represent the culmination of 
years of effort. They are examples to the world that the United States, 
Russia, and Kazakhstan are cooperating to build prosperity and stability 
in this part of the world.
    The CPC highlights the important progress by countries in the 
Caspian region in building a transparent and stable environment for 
international trade and investment. The CPC project also advances my 
administration's National Energy Policy by developing a network of 
multiple Caspian pipelines that also includes the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan, 
Baku-Supsa, and Baku-Novorossiysk oil pipelines and the Baku-Tbilisi-
Erzurum gas pipeline. These projects will help diversify U.S. energy 
supply and enhance our energy security, while supporting global economic 
growth.
