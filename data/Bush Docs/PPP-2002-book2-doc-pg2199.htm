Statement on the Resignation of Nick Calio<Calio, Nick<ls-thn-eq> as 
Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs
December 17, 2002

    Nick Calio has been a valuable and trusted member of my 
administration since the day I took office. As my top staff 
representative on Capitol Hill, he has been at the center of major 
legislative victories, from landmark education reforms to historic tax 
relief for the American people. Members of Congress have always been 
able to rely on Nick's integrity, forthrightness, and civility. I have 
been able to count on his good judgment, his energy, and his loyalty. He 
has given 2 years of faithful service, and he leaves with my gratitude 
and friendship.
