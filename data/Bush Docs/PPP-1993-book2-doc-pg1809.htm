Nomination for United States District Court Judges
October 22, 1993

    The President announced the nomination today of his choices for four 
U.S. District Court vacancies: Donetta Ambrose and Gary Lancaster, both 
for the Western District of Pennsylvania; Wilkie D. Ferguson for the 
Southern District of Florida; and Charles A. Shaw for the Eastern 
District of Missouri.
    ``I am committed to giving the American people a Federal judiciary 
marked by excellence, by diversity, and by a concern for the personal 
security and civil rights of all Americans,'' said the President. ``With 
these nominations today, we are giving just that to the people of 
Pennsylvania, Florida, and Missouri.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
