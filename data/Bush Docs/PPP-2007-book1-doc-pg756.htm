Statement on the Death of Ruth Bell Graham<Graham, Ruth Bell<ls-thn-eq>
June 14, 2007

    Laura and I are deeply saddened by the death of Ruth Bell Graham, a 
remarkable woman of faith whose life was defined by her belief in a 
personal, loving, and gracious God. She was an encouraging friend, 
accomplished poet, and devoted mother of 5 and grandmother of 19.
    Ruth's marriage to her husband Billy<Graham, William F. 
``Billy''<ls-thn-eq> was a true and loving partnership. As the wife of 
the world's most beloved evangelist, she inspired people around the 
world with her humor, intelligence, elegance, and kindness. Laura and I 
offer our prayers and condolences to Billy and the Graham family.
