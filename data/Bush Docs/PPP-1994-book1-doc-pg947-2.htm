Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the 
National Endowment for the Humanities
May 18, 1994

To the Congress of the United States:
    It is my pleasure to present to you the twenty-eighth annual report 
of National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). In terms of breadth and 
number of projects funded, this agency is the largest grant-making 
entity for the humanities in the country. The Endowment supports 
scholars, teachers, and students in their research and studies, and 
provides funds for projects such as documentary films and museum 
exhibitions that reach a large general audience. These humanities 
activities strengthen the cultural resources of the nation and provide 
insight into the problems that face our increasingly complex society.
    In addition to direct federal support of the humanities, NEH 
programs have stimulated private contributions, to date almost $1.3 
billion in matching gift funds. The Endowment also requires grantees in 
most programs to commit their own funds for part of the project costs. 
The NEH support of a project is highly respected and often attracts 
additional funding from other sources.
    The country can be proud of the role the Endowment has played as a 
catalyst for the support of excellent humanities scholarship and

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

May 18, 1994.
