Statement on the Supreme Court Decision on Campaign Financing
January 24, 2000

    The Court's opinion is a victory for democracy. The American people 
know that our political system needs to be fixed, and today's decision 
sets the stage for further reform. For years, I've challenged Congress 
to pass legislation that would ban the raising of unregulated soft 
money, address backdoor spending by outside organizations, and 
strengthen public discourse. Now I am again asking Congress to restore 
the American people's faith in their democracy and pass real reform this 
year.
