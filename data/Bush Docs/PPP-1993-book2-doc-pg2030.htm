November 19, 1993

    The President nominated eleven individuals to be U.S. district court 
judges. They are:

    Fred Biery, Western District of Texas

    ``As the Senate completes its work for this session, I am very 
pleased at the progress we have made in filling judicial vacancies,'' 
said the President. ``We have nominated more Federal judges by 
Thanksgiving than any of my recent predecessors and have appointed 
judges who are marked by both their excellence and commitment to public 
service. I intend to continue on this course when the Congress returns 
next year.''

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
