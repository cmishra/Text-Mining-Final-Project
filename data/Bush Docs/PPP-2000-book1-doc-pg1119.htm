Remarks in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on the Death of President
Hafiz al-Asad<Asad, Hafiz al-<ls-thn-eq> of Syria and an Exchange With 
Reporters
June 10, 2000

    The President. As all of you know, I received word not very long ago 
of President Asad's death in Syria today. I was very saddened by it, and 
I want to offer my condolences to his son,<Asad, Bashur<ls-thn-eq> his 
family, and to the people of Syria.
    You know, over the last 7 years, I had the occasion to meet with 
President Asad many times, and I believe I got to know him well. And 
while we had our disagreements, I always respected him because I felt 
that he was open and straightforward with me and because I felt

he meant it when he said he had made a strategic choice for peace. I 
regret that that peace was not achieved in his lifetime, and I hope that 
it can still be achieved, in no small measure because of the commitment 
he made.
    I think today, rather than speculating about the future, it would be 
best for all of us just to send our condolences and our best thoughts to 
his family and to the people of Syria.
    Thank you.
    Q.  Mr. President, since he was such a integral link in the process, 
is this going to delay the future of the process? How is it going to 
affect the expediency of the process that you've been trying to jump-
start recently?
    The President.  Peter, [Peter Maer, CBS News] I think it's premature 
to say. There will be a period of mourning in Syria. There will be a 
period of sorting out, and the Syrian people will make some decisions, 
and then we'll see what happens. But you know, we've been at this now 
for years because of the decision that he made to go back to 
negotiations and try to move away from conflict, and it's certainly a 
path that I hope the country will stay on.

 Note:  The President spoke at 12:17 p.m. on his arrival at the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. In his remarks, he referred 
to President's al-Asad's son, Bashur Asad.
