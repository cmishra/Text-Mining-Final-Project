Statement With Congressional Leaders on Budget Negotiations
December 22, 1995

    Today we had good meetings which built on the progress made in 
yesterday's discussions. Staff will prepare further analysis to clarify 
options for the budget advisory group, which will then advise the 
principals on outstanding issues. Following the meeting of the budget 
advisory group, the principals will meet again next Friday afternoon.

Note: This statement was announced jointly with Newt Gingrich, Speaker 
of the House of Representatives, and Bob Dole, Senate majority leader.
