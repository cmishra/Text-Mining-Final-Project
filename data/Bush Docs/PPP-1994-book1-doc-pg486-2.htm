Statement by the Director of Communications on United Nations Security 
Council Action on the Hebron Massacre
March 18, 1994

    The United Nations Security Council has today adopted a resolution 
condemning the Hebron mosque massacre and calling for measures to 
safeguard the security of the Palestinians.
    President Clinton expressed the horror of the American people at the 
time of the tragic Hebron murders. The President said, ``The enemies of 
peace must not be allowed to triumph. Prompt resumption of negotiations 
to begin implementation of the Israel-Palestinian Declaration of 
Principles is the only answer to extremist violence on both sides.''
    The President's decision to allow passage of the resolution was made 
in the context of the agreement today by Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon to 
return to negotiations in April and the high-level contacts between 
Israel and the PLO that will take place in coming days.
    The President endorses the call made by the Security Council today 
for Israel and the PLO to redouble their efforts to realize this goal as 
soon as possible. The United States stands ready to do all it can to 
help the parties, but with passage of this resolution it is time for 
them to return to the negotiating table.
    The United States abstained on two paragraphs in the preamble to the 
resolution because of our strong objections to references made there to 
``occupied Palestinian territory'' and to Jerusalem. The President said 
that his position on these matters has not changed. As Israel and the 
PLO have agreed, these are issues which can be decided only in 
negotiations on

the final status of the territories. He does not believe references 
which could prejudice the outcome of these negotiations are helpful. The 
parties alone must make the decisions necessary to realize the promise 
of peace.
