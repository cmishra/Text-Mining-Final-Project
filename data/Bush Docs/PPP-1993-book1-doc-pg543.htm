Exchange With Reporters in New Orleans
April 30, 1993

Bosnia

    Q. [Inaudible]
    The President. I'm going to have another meeting in the morning 
about it, do a little more work on the way back today, and then have 
another meeting in the morning. And then I may want to make another 
round of phone calls after we meet with the principals. And I expect 
then we'll be pretty close to deciding where we are. I want to get an 
updated report on the situation, and I'll ask a lot of questions about 
it.
    Q. Mr. President, has all this talk about military force already had 
an impact, sir? Do you think it's already had an impact?
    The President. I hope so. I hope so. I think it may well have, and I 
certainly hope so.

Note: The exchange began at 1:35 p.m. in the Health and Physical 
Education Center at the University of New Orleans. A tape was not 
available for verification of the content of this exchange.
