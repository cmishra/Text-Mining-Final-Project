Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Digital 
Computer Exports
December 28, 2001

Dear _____ :
    In accordance with the provisions of section 1211(d) of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law 105-85), I 
hereby notify you of my decision to establish a new level for the 
notification procedure for digital computers set forth in section 
1211(a) of Public Law 105-85. The new level will be 190,000 millions of 
theoretical operations per second (MTOPS). In accordance with the 
provisions of section 1211(e), I hereby notify you of my decision to 
remove Latvia from the list of countries covered under section 1211(b). 
The attached report provides the rationale supporting these decisions 
and fulfills the requirements of Public Law 105-85, sections 1211(d) and 
(e).
    I have made these changes based on the recommendation of the 
Departments of State, Defense, Commerce, and Energy.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Carl Levin, chairman, and John W. 
Warner, ranking member, Senate Committee on Armed Services; Henry J. 
Hyde, chairman, and Tom Lantos, ranking member, House Committee on 
International Relations; Bob Stump, chairman, and Ike Skelton, ranking 
member, House Committee on Armed Services; and Paul Sarbanes, chairman, 
and Phil Gramm, ranking member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs. This letter was released by the Office of the Press 
Secretary on January 2, 2002.
