Message to the Congress Transmitting the Report of the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting
July 10, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 
U.S.C. 396(i)), I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for Fiscal Year 1994 and the Inventory of 
the Federal Funds Distributed to Public Telecommunications Entities by 
Federal Departments and Agencies: Fiscal Year 1994.
    Since 1967, when the Congress created the Corporation, CPB has 
overseen the growth and development of quality services for millions of 
Americans.
    This year's report, entitled ``American Stories,'' is a departure 
from previous reports. It profiles people whose lives have been 
dramatically improved by public broadcasting in their local communities. 
The results are timely, lively, and intellectually provocative. In 
short, they're much like public broadcasting.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 10, 1995.
