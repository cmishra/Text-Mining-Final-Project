Statement on the Nomination of General Joseph W. Ralston<Ralston, Joseph 
W.<ls-thn-eq> to be Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
January 28, 1998

    I am pleased to announce that I have nominated General Joseph W. 
Ralston for a second 2-year tour as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff.
    General Ralston has served with distinction as Vice Chairman over 
the past 2 years, providing excellent advice and support for two 
Secretaries of Defense and two Chairmen. His experience with the 
quadrennial defense review and major defense policy issues, along with 
his demonstrated leadership skills, ensure that the position of Vice 
Chairman will continue to be filled by the high caliber of individual 
needed for this challenging and vital post.
