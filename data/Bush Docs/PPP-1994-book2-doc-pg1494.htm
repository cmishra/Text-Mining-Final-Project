Statement on Apple Exports to Japan
August 23, 1994

    I am pleased to announce that the Government of Japan has agreed to 
take the first steps to open its market to American apples. This is good 
news for Washington's apple industry and for those workers whose jobs 
depend on it.
    As many of you may know, American apples have been totally banned 
from the Japanese market for the past 23 years. After months of 
negotiations, however, we have cleared away obstacles to the export of 
apples from the State of Washington. Right now, apples are being 
inspected in preparation for export.
    Exports mean jobs, and that is why we will continue to work to open 
markets in Japan and elsewhere. I appreciate Japan taking this step 
toward greater liberalization of trade and closer economic relations 
between our two countries. As we move ahead, I look forward to building 
on this achievement to open Japan's markets to more of America's 
competitive goods and services.
