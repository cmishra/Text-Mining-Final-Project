Statement on the Death of Jack Buck<Buck, Jack>
June 19, 2002

    I am deeply saddened by the death of Jack Buck. Jack endeared 
himself to sports fans throughout the country with his colorful 
commentary and love of America's pastime. An honoree of the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame, Pro Football Hall of Fame, and Radio Hall of 
Fame, Jack covered sports in St. Louis, Missouri, and across the Nation 
for the last 50 years. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family. He 
will be missed.
