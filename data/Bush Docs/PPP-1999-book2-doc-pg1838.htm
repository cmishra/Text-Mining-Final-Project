Statement on the Election of Abdurrahman Wahid<Wahid, 
Abdurrahman> as President of Indonesia
October 20, 1999

    I congratulate Abdurrahman Wahid on his election as President of 
Indonesia. He and the people of Indonesia deserve enormous credit for 
the democratic process that led to this peaceful change in government. 
This election, conducted fairly and transparently, has been a true 
triumph of democracy.
    Indonesia still faces many challenges: achieving national 
reconciliation, consolidating economic recovery, and building 
institutions accountable to its people. With a democratically elected 
leadership, I am optimistic that real progress will be made toward all 
these goals.
    I look forward to working closely with the new President and his 
government.
