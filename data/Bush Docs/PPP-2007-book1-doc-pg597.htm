Remarks on Immigration Reform
May 17, 2007

    Secretary Gutierrez<Gutierrez, Carlos M.<ls-thn-eq> and Secretary 
Chertoff<Chertoff, Michael<ls-thn-eq> have just briefed me about the 
negotiations on the comprehensive immigration bill that just concluded 
in the Senate. I want to thank, first of all, my Secretaries for being 
involved in the process, being engaged in this important issue, and 
helping move the process forward. I congratulate Members of the Senate, 
both political parties, who decided it was time to work together to come 
up with a comprehensive immigration bill that addresses a major problem 
facing our country. After weeks of long work, these negotiations came to 
a successful conclusion.
    I want to thank the Members of the Senate who worked hard. I 
appreciate the leadership shown on both sides of the aisle. As I reflect 
upon this important accomplishment, important first step toward a 
comprehensive immigration bill, it reminds me of how much the Americans 
appreciate the fact that we can work together--when we work together, 
that they see positive things.
    Immigration is a tough issue for a lot of Americans. It's a--the 
agreement reached today is one that will help enforce our borders, but 
equally importantly, it will treat people with respect. This is a bill 
where people who live here in our country

will be treated without amnesty, but without animosity.
    And so I want to thank you all very much for representing the White 
House. I thank the Senators for working hard. I look forward to a good 
vote out of the United States Senate as quickly as Leader Reid<Reid, 
Harry<ls-thn-eq> can get the bill moving. And then of course we look 
forward to working with the House of Representatives to take this first 
step and convert it into a successful second step. I really am anxious 
to sign a comprehensive immigration bill as soon as I possibly can. 
Today we took a good step toward that direction.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 3:25 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to S. 1348. The Office of the Press 
Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of these remarks.
