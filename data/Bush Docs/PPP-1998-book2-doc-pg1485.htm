Statement on the Northwest Airlines Pilots Strike
August 31, 1998

    I have asked Northwest Airlines and its pilots to redouble their 
efforts to resolve their differences. Senior members of my 
administration continue to be in contact with the parties, but it is up 
to the negotiating parties to reach an agreement. Specifically, I have 
asked Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater to meet with the 
parties' leadership. I hope that an agreement will be concluded soon in 
their interests and the interest of the American people.
