Statement on the Death of John Robert Starr<Starr, John 
Robert<ls-thn-eq>
April 1, 2000

    Hillary and I are saddened to hear that John Robert Starr has passed 
away. He was a legendary figure in Little Rock and Arkansas history. As 
a former Arkansas bureau chief for the Associated Press, managing editor 
of the Arkansas Democrat and Democrat-Gazette, and a tough-as-nails 
columnist, John Robert always said and did what he thought was right.
    John Robert was as tenacious a friend as he was a foe. In good and 
bad times alike, I always knew him to speak his mind and say exactly 
what he felt. That kind of candor can be strong medicine, but I learned 
to respect him for it. His legion of readers might not always agree with 
his point of view, but they read what he had to say.
    Hillary and I offer our deepest condolences to his wife, 
Norma,<Starr, Norma<ls-thn-eq> their three children, and their many 
friends.
