Statement on Senate Action on Judicial Nominations
March 9, 2000

    Today the Senate finally confirmed, after 4 years, Judge Richard 
Paez<Paez, Richard A.<ls-thn-eq> and, after 2 years, Marsha 
Berzon<Berzon, Marsha<ls-thn-eq> to the United States Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit.
    Both of these candidates bring extraordinary experience and 
diversity to the bench. Both received the American Bar Association's 
highest rating. Both were approved by solid bipartisan majorities today, 
but unfortunately both were forced to wait far too long to receive 
votes.
    This week the Senate also confirmed Judge Julio Fuentes<Fuentes, 
Julio<ls-thn-eq> of New Jersey, who becomes the first Hispanic to serve 
on the Third Circuit. Judge Fuentes had to wait a year for his vote, but 
when it finally came, he was approved unanimously by a vote of 93 to 0.
    I want to thank the Senate for moving this process forward. But I 
want to repeat that dozens of qualified judicial nominees still await 
confirmation. Meanwhile, caseloads rise and

backlogs mount. These fine Americans have offered themselves to serve 
our country--and they are entitled to an up-or-down vote. Election year 
politics should not be used as an excuse to slow down the confirmation 
process.
    This is a good day for our country. But we must keep going. It's 
what our nominees deserve and what justice demands.
