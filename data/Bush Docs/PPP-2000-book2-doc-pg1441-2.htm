<DOC>

District of Columbia
July 20, 2000

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with section 202(c) of the District of Columbia 
Financial Management and Responsibility Assistance Act of 1995 and 
section 446 of the District of Columbia Self-Governmental Reorganization 
Act as amended in 1989, I am transmitting the District of Columbia's 
Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Request Act.
    The proposed FY 2001 Budget reflects the major programmatic 
objectives of the Mayor, the Council of the District of Columbia, and 
the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management 
Assistance Authority. For FY 2001, the District estimates revenue of 
$5.718 billion and total expenditures of $5.714 billion, resulting in a 
budget surplus of $4.128 million.
    My transmittal of the District of Columbia's budget, as required by 
law, does not represent an endorsement of its contents.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

July 20, 2000.
