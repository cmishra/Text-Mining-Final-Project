Statement on Additional Assistance for Victims of Hurricane Floyd
November 4, 1999

    Today I will seek congressional approval for $429 million in 
additional assistance for the victims of Hurricane Floyd in North 
Carolina, New Jersey, and all the States affected by this disaster. 
These are existing funds that will be reallocated within the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. They will assist in the buyout and 
relocation of homes located in floodplains that remain vulnerable to 
future floods.
    Additionally, I continue to urge Congress to fully fund my request 
for SBA's disaster loan program that can help families and small 
businesses rebuild in the wake of hurricanes and other natural 
disasters. I have already asked Congress to provide $500 million that 
will help farmers in New Jersey and other States who have suffered 
severe crop losses due to drought and flooding. I urge Congress to meet 
my requests to help alleviate the suffering of those affected by 
Hurricane Floyd.
