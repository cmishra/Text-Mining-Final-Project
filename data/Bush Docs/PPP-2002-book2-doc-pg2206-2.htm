Statement on Signing Legislation To Reauthorize the Hydrographic 
Services Improvement Act of 1998 and for Other Purposes
December 19, 2002

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 4883, an Act to reauthorize the 
Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998, and for other purposes.
    The executive branch shall construe sections 221(a)(4), 223(b), and 
241(a)(2) of the Act as providing statutory bases for revocation of 
commissions or removal from service that are separate from, in addition 
to, and not in derogation of the President's constitutional authority to 
remove officers of the United States. The executive branch also shall 
construe sections 222 and 224 in a manner consistent with the 
President's constitutional authority to nominate and appoint candidates 
who are not the subject of recommendations under those sections.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 December 19, 2002.

Note: H.R. 4883, approved December 19, was assigned Public Law No. 107-
372.
