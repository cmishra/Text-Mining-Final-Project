Statement on the Tornado Damage in Salt Lake City, Utah
August 11, 1999

    I want to express my concern for the people of Salt Lake City, who 
are suffering the effects of a devastating tornado that tore through 
their city this afternoon. I was particularly saddened to learn that the 
tornado left at least one person dead and dozens injured. Officials from 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are already on the 
ground; more officials are

en route; and FEMA Director James Lee Witt<Witt, James Lee> 
has talked by phone with Governor Leavitt.<Leavitt, Michael 
O.> The burden of recovery will be heavy, but it is a burden 
that the people of Salt Lake City need not carry alone. As they begin 
the difficult process of mourning, healing, and rebuilding, our Nation 
stands steadfastly behind them.
