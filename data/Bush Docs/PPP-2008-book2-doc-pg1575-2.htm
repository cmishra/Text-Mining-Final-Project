Message to the Congress Transmitting an Extension of the Russia-United 
States Mutual Fisheries Agreement
January 15, 2009

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an 
Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Russian Federation Extending the Agreement Between the 
Government of the United States and the Government of the Russian 
Federation on Mutual Fisheries Relations of May 31, 1988, with annex, as 
extended (the ``Mutual Fisheries Agreement''). The present Agreement, 
which was effected by an exchange of notes in Moscow on March 28, 2008, 
and September 19, 2008, extends the Mutual Fisheries Agreement until 
December 31, 2013.

    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Russian Federation, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 January 15, 2009.
