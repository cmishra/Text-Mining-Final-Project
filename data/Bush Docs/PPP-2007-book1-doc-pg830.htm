Statement on the Removal of the Bald Eagle From the List of Endangered 
Species
June 28, 2007

    I am pleased that the bald eagle--our Nation's symbol for more than 
225 years and an image of inspiration and freedom to all Americans--is 
now being removed from the list of endangered species.
    Forty years ago, only 400 nesting pairs were living. Today, nearly 
10,000 nesting pairs are thriving in the lower 48 States. This number is 
more than triple the recovery goal set in the Endangered Species Act.
    The overwhelming success of bald eagle recovery was made possible by 
a strong partnership between Federal and State governments and private 
landowners. The eagle will continue to flourish under Federal protection 
through the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.
    This great conservation achievement means more and more Americans 
across the Nation will enjoy the thrill of seeing bald eagles soar. What 
a wonderful way to celebrate this Fourth of July.
