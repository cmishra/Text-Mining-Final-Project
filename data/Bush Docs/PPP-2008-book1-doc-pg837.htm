Remarks Following a Briefing on the Security Situation in Afghanistan
June 17, 2008

    The President. It's been my privilege to have served with two really 
fine Americans, General Dan McNeill<McNeill, Dan K.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Maureen McNeill.<McNeill, Maureen<ls-thn-eq> I've gotten to know the 
General well. He's a tough, no-nonsense patriot who was our commander in 
Afghanistan. I want to thank you very much for the briefing

you just gave me about the issues that we face, your optimism about 
success.
    I was telling the Secretary<Gates, Robert M.<ls-thn-eq> and the 
General,<McNeill, Dan K.<ls-thn-eq> I just--about my trip to Europe, 
where I was pleased with the strong commitments of our allies to helping 
us succeed in Afghanistan. They know that what happens in Afghanistan 
matters to their own internal security.
    They fully understand as well that helping young girls go to school 
and helping moms raise their babies in a--you know, in a better 
environment, helping rebuild this society after years of tyranny is in 
all our interests. And it's also a moral duty we have.
    And so I'm pleased, Mr. Secretary,<Gates, Robert M.<ls-thn-eq> that 
your hard work in working with the allies is paying off.
    And, General,<McNeill, Dan K.<ls-thn-eq> I know you're moving on, 
but the country thanks you for what you did. The world is better off 
because of your service. I'm proud to have you here.
    Gen. Dan K. McNeill.<McNeill, Dan K.<ls-thn-eq> Thank you, Mr. 
President.
    The President. Yes, sir. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:44 a.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Gen. Dan K. McNeill, USA, former 
commander, NATO International Security Assistance Force, Afghanistan, 
and his wife Maureen; and Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates.
