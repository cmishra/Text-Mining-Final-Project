Message to the Senate Transmitting the Israel-United States Protocol 
Amending the Convention Relating to Extradition
September 13, 2005

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol between the Government of 
the United States and the Government of the State of Israel, signed at 
Jerusalem on July 6, 2005.
    In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate the report 
of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol. As the report 
explains, the Protocol will not require implementing legislation.
    The Protocol amends the Convention Relating to Extradition (the 
``1962 Convention''), signed at Washington on December 10, 1962. The 
Protocol updates the 1962 Convention in a manner consistent with our 
modern extradition treaties. The Protocol will, upon entry into force, 
enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of both 
nations and make a significant contribution to international law 
enforcement efforts.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 September 13, 2005.

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
September 14.
