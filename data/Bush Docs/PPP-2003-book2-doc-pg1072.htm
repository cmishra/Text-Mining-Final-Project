Dear Mr. Chairman:

international programs and activities related to climate change, and 
associated expenditures by line item as presented in the President's 
Budget Appendix amended to reflect enacted FY 2003 appropriations.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Ted Stevens, chairman, Senate 
Committee on Appropriations; and C.W. Bill Young, chairman, House 
Committee on Appropriations. This letter was released by the Office of
