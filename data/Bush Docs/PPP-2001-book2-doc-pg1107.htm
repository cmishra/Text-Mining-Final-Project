Memorandum on Benefits for Survivors of Public Safety Officers
September 13, 2001

Memorandum for the Attorney General

Subject: Benefits for Survivors of Public Safety Officers

    I hereby direct you to implement procedures to streamline the 
application, approval, and payment process for claims for benefits under 
the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act of 1976 by eligible survivors 
of firefighters, police officers, medical rescue personnel, and other 
public safety officers who died in the line of duty as a result of the 
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
    I further direct that you work with Federal, State and local 
officials and deploy the resources of the relevant offices within the 
Department of Justice to provide immediate assistance to the survivors 
of those public safety officers who have sacrificed their lives for our 
communities and country.

                                                          George W. Bush
