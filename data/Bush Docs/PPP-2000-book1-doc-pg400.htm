March 7, 2000

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. Chairman:)
    In accordance with Public Law 95-384 (22 U.S.C. 2373(c)), I submit 
to you a report on progress toward a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus 
question covering the period December 1, 1999, to January 31, 2000. The 
previous submission covered events during October and November 1999.
    The United Nations convened 12 days of intensive talks to resolve 
the Cyprus dispute in early December. United Nations Secretary General 
Annan<Annan, Kofi<ls-thn-eq> reported that both parties engaged 
seriously on the whole range of issues that divide them. My Special 
Envoy for Cyprus, Alfred H. Moses,<Moses, Alfred H.<ls-thn-eq> and his 
team provided critical diplomatic support for the United Nations efforts 
to reach a comprehensive settlement.
    Talks resumed in Geneva on January 31 where United Nations Special 
Advisor Alvaro de Soto<de Soto, Alvaro<ls-thn-eq> held a series of 
meetings with both sides. The parties will continue discussions on May 
23 in New York. We welcome this important process, and we will continue 
to work with the United Nations to reach a solution for all Cypriots 
based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Jesse Helms, chairman, Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations.
