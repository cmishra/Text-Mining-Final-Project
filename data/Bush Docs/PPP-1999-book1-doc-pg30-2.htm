Statement on the Nigerian Elections
January 11, 1999

    I congratulate the people of Nigeria for the strong turnout and 
orderly conduct of the January 9th elections for State Governors and 
assemblies. Although results from these elections have not yet been 
released, Nigeria should be proud of its achievements to date in 
conducting transparent and inclusive elections that are building the 
foundation for a successful return to democratic, civilian government. I 
am pleased that

the United States is providing $5 million to support this effort.
    These elections represent a critical step in Nigeria's 
transformation. Since June, General Abubakar,<Abubakar, 
Abdulsalam> his government, and the people of Nigeria have 
engaged in a sustained and serious effort to rectify the abuses of the 
past: political prisoners have been freed; onerous restrictions on labor 
unions have been lifted; the empty positions on Nigeria's Supreme Court 
have been filled; and a transparent ``Budget of Realism'' has been 
announced by the government. I and the people of the United States look 
forward to continuing to work with Nigeria to ensure that these 
political and economic reform efforts continue. And I hope that some day 
soon, Nigeria will be able to resume its place as a democratic leader in 
Africa.
