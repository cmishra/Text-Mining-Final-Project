Statement on the Resignation of Henry Kissinger<Kissinger, 
Henry<ls-thn-eq> as Chairman of the National Commission on Terrorist 
Attacks Upon the United States
December 13, 2002

    It is with regret that I accept Dr. Kissinger's decision to step 
down as Chairman of the national commission to investigate the events of 
September 11, 2001, and the years that led up to that event.
    As I stated at the time of his appointment, Dr. Kissinger is one our 
Nation's most accomplished and respected public servants. I thank him 
for his willingness to consider serving his country once again. His 
chairmanship would have provided the insights and analysis the 
Government needs to understand the methods of our enemies and the nature 
of the threats we face.
    My administration will work quickly to select a new Chairman whose 
mission will be to uncover every detail and learn every lesson of 
September 11, even as we act on what we have learned so far to better 
protect and defend America.
