Statement on Signing the Veterans' Compensation Rate Amendments of 1997
November 19, 1997

    Today I was pleased to sign into law H.R. 2367, the ``Veterans' 
Compensation Rate Amendments of 1997.''
    Our Nation provides compensation payments to veterans who were 
disabled in service and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) 
benefits to the survivors of those who died in military service. By 
maintaining the real value of these payments, we honor their sacrifices.
    This Act provides a 2.1 percent increase in compensation and DIC 
benefits, effective December 1, 1997. This increase is the same 
percentage increase that Social Security beneficiaries and veterans' 
pension recipients will receive in January. Approximately 2.3 million 
veterans and over 300,000 surviving spouses and children will benefit 
from this increase.
    Time will never erode the supreme value of our veterans' and 
servicmembers' efforts in defending the Nation's freedom. We also must 
not allow it to erode the value of our commitments to them. This 
legislation ensures that the worth of their richly deserved benefits 
keeps pace with consumer prices. As such, it maintains our obligation to 
those individuals whose sacrifices we will always remember.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

November 19, 1997.

Note: H.R. 2367, approved November 19, was assigned Public Law No. 105-
98.
