Statement on Proposed Legislation To Improve Work Incentives for Persons 
With Disabilities
May 19, 1999

    I commend the House Commerce Committee for its overwhelming 
bipartisan support for the ``Work Incentives Improvement Act'' today. By 
unanimously endorsing this legislation, the committee has taken an 
important step towards removing significant barriers to work for one of 
our Nation's most significant untapped resources--millions of people 
with disabilities. The committee's action, under the leadership of 
Chairman Bliley<Bliley, Tom> and Congressman Dingell,<Dingell, 
John D.> parallels the overwhelmingly bipartisan support that 
the Roth/Moynihan/Jeffords/Kennedy version of this legislation received 
from the Senate Finance Committee.
    Americans with disabilities can and do bring tremendous energy and 
talent to the American workforce, but the unemployment rate for all 
working-age adults with disabilities is nearly 75 percent. One of the 
most glaring problems is that people with disabilities frequently become 
ineligible for Medicaid or Medicare if they go back to work. This puts 
people with disabilities in the untenable position of choosing between 
health care coverage and work. The ``Work Incentives Improvement Act'' 
would improve job opportunities for people with disabilities by 
increasing access to health care and employment services.
    Justin Dart,<Dart, Justin, Jr.> one of the foremost 
leaders of the disability community, has said that the ``Work Incentives 
Improvement Act'' is ``one of the boldest since the landmark passage of 
the Americans with Disabilities Act.'' As I indicated in my State of the 
Union Address, I could not agree more with him. I urge Speaker 
Hastert<Hastert, J. Dennis> and Majority Leader Lott<Lott, 
Trent> to move promptly to schedule votes on this important 
and long overdue legislation.
