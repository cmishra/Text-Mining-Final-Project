Statement on the National Economy
May 25, 2006

    America's economy is on the fast track. Today's revised report by 
the Commerce Department indicates our economy grew at 5.3 percent for 
the first quarter of this year. That is the fastest growth in 2\1/2\ 
years and another clear sign that our economy is powerful, productive, 
and prosperous. I commend America's workers, small-business owners, and 
innovators for contributing to this strong economic growth. I will 
continue to work to pursue progrowth policies, make the tax cuts 
permanent, and restrain Government spending so that opportunity reaches 
every American neighborhood and every American family.
