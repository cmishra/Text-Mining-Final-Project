Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting 
Budget Amendments
June 9, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:
    I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed amendments to my FY 2009 
Budget for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health and Human 
Services, Homeland Security, the Interior, Labor, and the Treasury. 
Overall, the discretionary budget authority proposed in my FY 2009 
Budget would not be increased by these requests.
    I am requesting an additional $546 million for the Department of 
Commerce to cover increased costs to conduct the 2010 Decennial Census. 
I am also requesting $275 million for the Department of Health and Human 
Services to improve food and medical product safety and $1 million for 
the Department of Homeland Security to continue operations of the Office 
of the Federal Coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding through February 
28, 2009. These amounts are fully offset by reductions to other 
accounts.
    The details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter 
from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on 
June 10.
