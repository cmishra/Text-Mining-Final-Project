Message to the Senate Transmitting the Belize-United States Stolen 
Vehicle Treaty With Documentation
June 23, 1998

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Treaty Between the Government of 
the United States of America and the Government of Belize for the Return 
of Stolen Vehicles, with Annexes and Protocol, signed at Belmopan on 
October 3, 1996. I transmit also, for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
    The Treaty is one of a series of stolen vehicle treaties being 
negotiated by the United States in order to eliminate the difficulties 
faced by owners of vehicles that have been stolen and transported across 
international borders. When it enters into force, it will be an 
effective tool to facilitate the return of U.S. vehicles that have

been stolen and taken to Belize. The Treaty establishes procedures for 
the recovery and return of vehicles that are registered, titled, or 
otherwise documented in the territory of one Party, stolen in the 
territory of that Party or from one of its nationals, and found in the 
territory of the other Party.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Treaty, with Annexes and Protocol, and give its advice and 
consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

June 23, 1998.
