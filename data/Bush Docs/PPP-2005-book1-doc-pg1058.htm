Message to the Congress Transmitting Legislation and Supporting 
Documents To Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United 
States Free Trade Agreement
June 23, 2005

To the Congress of the United States:
    I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents to 
implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free 
Trade Agreement (the ``Agreement''). The Agreement represents an 
historic development in our relations with Central America and the 
Dominican Republic and reflects the commitment of the United States to 
supporting democracy, regional integration, and economic growth and 
opportunity in a region that has transitioned to peaceful, democratic 
societies.
    In negotiating this Agreement, my Administration was guided by the 
objectives

set out in the Trade Act of 2002. Central America and the Dominican 
Republic constitute our second largest export market in Latin America 
and our tenth largest export market in the world. The Agreement will 
create significant new opportunities for American workers, farmers, 
ranchers, and businesses by opening new markets and eliminating 
barriers. United States agricultural exports will obtain better access 
to the millions of consumers in Central America and the Dominican 
Republic.
    Under the Agreement, tariffs on approximately 80 percent of U.S. 
exports will be eliminated immediately. The Agreement will help to level 
the playing field because about 80 percent of Central America's imports 
already enjoy duty-free access to our market. By providing for the 
effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws, combined with 
strong remedies for noncompliance, the Agreement will contribute to 
improved worker rights and high levels of environmental protection in 
Central America and the Dominican Republic.
    By supporting this Agreement, the United States can stand with those 
in the region who stand for democracy and freedom, who are fighting 
corruption and crime, and who support the rule of law. A stable, 
democratic, and growing Central America and Dominican Republic 
strengthens the United States economically and provides greater security 
for our citizens.
    The Agreement is in our national interest, and I urge the Congress 
to approve it expeditiously.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 June 23, 2005.
