Statement on the Third Anniversary of the Death of Former Prime Minister 
Rafiq Hariri of Lebanon
February 14, 2008

    Today marks the third anniversary of the assassination of former 
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. The terrorist attack that killed 
Prime Minister Hariri, Minister Basil Fuleihan, and many other innocent 
victims was the spark that launched a transformation in Lebanon, as the 
Lebanese people demanded an end to the Syrian occupation and the 
restoration of their sovereignty.
    Since the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri, many other 
Lebanese patriots have been murdered by those who seek to use violence 
and intimidation to derail progress toward a free, independent, and 
prosperous Lebanon. It is vital that the perpetrators of these attacks 
be brought to justice, and I, therefore, call upon the international 
community to redouble its support for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. 
The United States support for the Government and people of Lebanon 
remains firm and unwavering.
    Syria, Iran, and their allies must end their efforts to undermine 
Lebanon's legitimate Government and to interfere in its political 
process. The Lebanese deserve a President elected in accordance with 
their Constitution, without preconditions and in an environment free 
from fear and intimidation.
    The foundation of freedom in Lebanon, which Mr. Hariri helped lay, 
remains strong. We will continue to support the people of Lebanon as 
they work to rid the country of terrorism and violence and exercise 
their democratic freedoms in peace.
