Statement on Signing the National Invasive Species Act of 1996
October 26, 1996

    I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 4283, the ``National Invasive 
Species Act of 1996.''
    This legislation will help to control the unintentional introduction 
and spread of invasive species, such as zebra mussel, throughout the 
waters of our Nation. The damage such species cause to our environment 
and the economy, including our fisheries, is significant and continues 
to increase.
    H.R. 4283 will establish a national voluntary ballast water 
management program to reduce the threat of additional pest species 
entering our waters. The bill also includes provisions to support 
important research and demonstrations of new technologies for combating 
aquatic nuisance species.
    This bill is an important tool to safeguard our economic and 
environmental resources, and I am pleased to sign it.

Note: H.R. 4283, approved October 26, was assigned Public Law No. 104-
332.
