Statement on the Election of Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard To 
Chair the Congressional Hispanic Caucus
November 17, 1998

    I am pleased that today the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) 
elected Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard as their new chair for the 
106th Congress. Representative Roybal-Allard has already established a 
record of distinction, serving her constituents in the 33d District of 
California and as a national leader in the areas of education, financial 
services, homeownership, and women's and children's rights.
    I commend outgoing CHC Chair Xavier Becerra for his outstanding 
leadership of the caucus, and I am confident that Representative Roybal-
Allard will be an excellent advocate for the caucus and the entire 
Latino community. I look forward to working with Chairwoman Roybal-
Allard and the entire Congressional Hispanic Caucus during the 106th 
Congress.
