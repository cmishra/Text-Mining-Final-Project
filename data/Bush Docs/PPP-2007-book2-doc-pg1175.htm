Statement on the Death of Jennifer Blackburn Dunn<Dunn, Jennifer 
Blackburn<ls-thn-eq>
September 6, 2007

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are deeply saddened by the death 
of Jennifer Dunn. She was a good friend and compassionate leader. During 
her congressional career, Jennifer effectively promoted policies that 
enabled more people throughout our country to realize the American 
Dream. She was committed to reforming welfare, reducing taxes, and 
strengthening our health care system. She was a tireless advocate for 
free trade and worked to eliminate the death tax, believing that 
leadership on these issues would foster growth and prosperity for small 
businesses and communities. As a member of the House Republican 
leadership, Jennifer used her position to help strengthen women's rights 
and protect children.
    After leaving Congress, Jennifer continued to be a strong advocate 
of commonsense conservative values.
    Jennifer was most proud of her family. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with Keith,<Thomson, Keith<ls-thn-eq> Bryant,<Dunn, Bryant<ls-thn-eq> 
Reagan,<Dunn, Reagan<ls-thn-eq> and Angus.<Thomson, Angus<ls-thn-eq>
