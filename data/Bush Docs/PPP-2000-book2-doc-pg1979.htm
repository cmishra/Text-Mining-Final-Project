Statement on Deferring Deportation of Liberian Refugees
September 28, 2000

    Today I directed the Attorney General and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to defer for one year from September 29 the 
deportation of certain Liberians who are present in the United States on 
that date. This action is aimed at promoting stability in Liberia and 
West Africa. In particular, I am concerned that a decision by our 
Government to deport Liberians who have enjoyed the protection of our 
country for many years could cause the involuntary repatriation of many 
thousands of Liberian refugees from other nations in West Africa. This 
would severely burden Liberia and cause instability in Liberia and in 
the region. I understand that Congress is actively considering a 
legislative fix for this problem, and I would welcome any solution that 
would provide relief for Liberians with longstanding ties to the United 
States.
