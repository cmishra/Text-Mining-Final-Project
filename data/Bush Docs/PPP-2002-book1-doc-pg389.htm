Barriers to Community and Other Service Activities
March 12, 2002

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Inventory of Federal Service Opportunities and Regulatory 
Barriers to Community and Other Service Activities

    I established by Executive Order 13254 of January 29, 2002, the USA 
Freedom Corps in order to encourage service and volunteerism in America. 
Building on our Nation's rich tradition of volunteer service, my 
Administration's policy is to foster a culture of service, citizenship, 
and responsibility by promoting, expanding, and enhancing service 
opportunities for all Americans. Consistent with that policy, I hereby 
direct you to take the following steps:

  <bullet>   Within 30 days, identify and report to the Assistant to the 
            President and Director of the USA Freedom Corps Office on 
            the service opportunities both for your employees and for 
            the public at large that are sponsored or administered by 
            your department or agency. Such report shall also describe 
            the extent to which this information is available to the 
            public on your department or agency's website.
  <bullet>   Within 30 days, identify and report to the Assistant to the 
            President and Director of the USA Freedom Corps Office on 
            Federal regulatory and programmatic barriers in your 
            department or agency to community and other service by 
            Americans. Such report shall also include recommendations as 
            to how to modify or repeal such barriers in order to enhance 
            service opportunities.

    This directive shall be construed consistent with Executive Order 
13254.

                                                          George W. Bush
