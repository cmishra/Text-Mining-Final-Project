Statement on Receiving the Interim Report of the Secretary of State's 
Special Advisory Committee on Religious Freedom Abroad
January 23, 1998

    I welcome the report of the Committee, which my administration 
established in November 1996 to advise us on means to combat religious 
persecution and intolerance abroad.
    I am pleased that the Committee has recognized the considerable 
efforts we have already made to raise the profile of these issues and 
invigorate our advocacy, and we will carefully study the Committee's 
recommendations on how we can do more.
    This distinguished group of Americans is playing a critical role in 
our effort to promote religious freedom abroad, and we look forward to a 
continued and close collaboration as the Committee prepares its final 
report in the months to come.
