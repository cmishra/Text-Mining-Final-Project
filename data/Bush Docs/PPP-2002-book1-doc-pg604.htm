Statement on House of Representatives Action on Pension Reform 
Legislation
April 11, 2002

    Employees need more information about their pension plans and more 
control over them. I commend Chairman Thomas,<Thomas, William 
M.> Chairman Boehner,<Boehner, John A.> and 
Congressman Portman,<Portman, Rob> and the bipartisan majority 
in the House for passing pension reform legislation that accomplishes 
these objectives. The reforms will give employees better access to 
investment advice, additional notice of blackouts, and increased ability 
to diversify. Importantly, the reforms adhere to the principle that what 
is right for executives is also right for workers. I look forward to 
Senate action on this critical issue.
