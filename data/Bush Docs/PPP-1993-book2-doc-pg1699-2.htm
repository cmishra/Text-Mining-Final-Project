October 6, 1993

    The President announced today that he has nominated Gerald Stern, an 
experienced corporate attorney and former Justice Department civil 
rights attorney, to be the Special Counsel for Financial Institutions 
Fraud at the Department of Justice.
    ``To preserve our people's trust in their financial institutions, it 
is imperative that we aggressively enforce the laws governing them,'' 
said the President. ``Gerald Stern has the business experience and 
prosecutorial skill to make sure that we do just that.''

Press Secretary.
