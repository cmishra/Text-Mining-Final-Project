Statement on the Clear Skies Initiative
July 1, 2002

    Today Environmental Protection Administrator Whitman<Whitman, 
Christine Todd<ls-thn-eq> released important new information about the 
unprecedented health and environmental benefits of the Clear Skies 
Initiative that I proposed in February. For the last several months, EPA 
has been working to generate new information about how Clear Skies will 
dramatically improve air quality in every region of the country. Clear 
Skies will bring Americans much cleaner air and healthier forests, 
lakes, and estuaries. Many cities and towns will meet air quality 
standards for the first time in years. We will virtually eliminate the 
problem of acid rain, which affects so many lakes and forests in the 
Northeast. We also will dramatically reduce urban smog and nitrogen and 
mercury deposition. Clear Skies will reduce air pollution from 
powerplants by 70 percent--the most significant step America has ever 
taken to address this problem--while using a market-based system to keep 
electricity prices affordable for hardworking Americans. Administrator 
Whitman<Whitman, Christine Todd<ls-thn-eq> and I look forward to working 
with Congress to strengthen the Clean Air Act through the passage of 
Clear Skies so we can improve air quality for all Americans.
