Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report on Normal Trade 
Relations Status for Belarus
June 3, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(d)(1) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Act''), with respect to the 
continuation of a waiver of the application of subsections (a) and (b) 
of section 402 of the Act. This document constitutes my recommendation 
to continue in effect this waiver for a further 12-month period, and 
includes my determination that continuation of the waiver currently in 
effect for the Republic of Belarus will substantially promote the 
objectives of section 402 of the Act. I will submit separate reports 
with respect to Vietnam and the People's Republic of China.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
The related memorandum is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume. The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 
1998, Public Law 105-206, section 5003, changed the term ``most-favored-
nation'' status to ``normal trade relations'' status.
