    Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming--Mrs. Shriver<Shriver, 
Eunice Kennedy<ls-thn-eq> and Special Olympics athletes, friends and 
family. Mr. President--the President of Iceland<Grimsson, 
Olafur<ls-thn-eq> has joined us--proud you're here, President Grimsson.

Lady Torrijos, is with us as well. We've got Members of the Congress and 
Members of the Senate. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are glad you 
all are here. Welcome to this special occasion.
    We're here to celebrate the Special Olympics and to honor a woman 
who made them possible, Eunice Kennedy Shriver.<Shriver, Eunice 
Kennedy<ls-thn-eq> And we're here to celebrate her birthday. [Laughter]
    In a moment, we'll hear from this woman<Shriver, Eunice 
Kennedy<ls-thn-eq> who has made it her life's work to create 
opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. She founded the 
Special Olympics in 1968 to get people with intellectual disabilities 
the chance to develop physical fitness, to create friendships, and 
experience the joy of sports competition and achievement. Today, the 
Special Olympics includes more than 2.25 million athletes in 150 
countries. The games have become a source of unity and excitement for 
its participants. They've helped raise awareness of the challenges 
facing those with intellectual disabilities.
    America upholds the values of every person and the possibilities of 
every life. And the Special Olympics are an example of America at its 
best. We share with the entire world the spirit of joy and kindness that 
the Special Olympics brings.
    If you ever had any doubt about how much good one person can do, 
look no further than this kind and gracious lady.<Shriver, Eunice 
Kennedy<ls-thn-eq> On this special occasion, I ask you to join me in a 
toast to the Special Olympics and to Eunice Kennedy Shriver and to her 
contributions to our Nation, past, present, and future. God bless.

Note: The President spoke at 7:40 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder 
and honorary chairman, Special Olympics; President Olafur Grimsson of 
Iceland; and Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos, wife of President Martin 
Torrijos Espino of Panama.
