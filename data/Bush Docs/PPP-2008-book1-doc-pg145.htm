Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Report Relating to the 
Interdiction of Aircraft Engaged in Illicit Drug Trafficking
January 31, 2008

Dear Madam Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with the authorities relating to official immunity in the 
interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking (Public Law 
107-108, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2291-4), and in order to keep the 
Congress fully informed, I am providing a report prepared by my 
Administration. This report includes matters relating to the 
interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. This 
letter was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on February 4.
