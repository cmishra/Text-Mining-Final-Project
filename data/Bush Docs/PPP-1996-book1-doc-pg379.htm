Statement on the Report of the White House Conference on Aging
March 6, 1996

    I was gratified today to receive the final report of the White House 
Conference on Aging, a comprehensive look at aging policy in America 
developed over 2 years with the input of more than 125,000 men and 
women. My deep thanks and appreciation go out to all of those Americans 
who contributed to this incredible grassroots effort.
    These recommendations, which demonstrate strong support for many of 
the priorities I have been fighting for, including the preservation and 
protection of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, will be given 
every serious consideration by my administration.
