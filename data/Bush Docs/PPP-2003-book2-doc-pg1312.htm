Statement on Japan's Announcement of Reconstruction Aid to Iraq
October 15, 2003

    I welcome Japan's announcement that it will provide $1.5 billion 
toward immediate reconstruction needs in Iraq. I applaud this bold step, 
which will help mobilize international support for efforts to build a 
stable, peaceful, and democratic Iraq. Japan recognizes that this effort 
is critical to security and peace not only in Iraq and the Middle East 
but also for Japan and throughout the world. Japan's own history shows 
the power of international cooperation to help a great people build 
democracy and prosperity and become a beacon of freedom that inspires 
all nations.
    I also commend Japan's announcement that it is working on a larger 
aid package in preparation for the October 23-24 Madrid Donor's 
Conference. We look forward to working with Japan and other countries to 
make the Madrid Conference a success for the people of Iraq.
