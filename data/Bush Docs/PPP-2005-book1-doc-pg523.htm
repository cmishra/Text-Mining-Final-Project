Remarks to Reporters at Fort Hood, Texas
March 27, 2005

    I want to wish all the fellow citizens and their families a happy 
Easter. We prayed for peace. We prayed for our soldiers and their 
families. It's an honor to be here at Fort Hood to celebrate Easter with 
those who wear the Nation's uniform.
    We wish you all a happy Easter too. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 11:53 a.m. at the 4th Infantry Division 
Memorial Chapel. A tape was not available for verification of the 
content of these remarks.
