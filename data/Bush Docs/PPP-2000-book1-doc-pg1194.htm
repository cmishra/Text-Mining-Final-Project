Statement on House of Representatives Action on Tobacco Litigation 
Legislation
June 20, 2000

    I am very pleased that the House of Representatives reversed its 
position in favor of tobacco companies and today passed an amendment to 
advance public health by siding with American veterans and taxpayers.
    The House decision today to reconsider its support of tobacco 
companies clears the path for the Veterans Administration to help 
support tobacco litigation, which could mean billions of dollars to 
improve veterans medical care. I applaud the perseverance of a 
bipartisan group, led by Representative Henry Waxman,<Waxman, Henry 
A.<ls-thn-eq> Representative Lane Evans,<Evans, Lane<ls-thn-eq> 
Representative Jim Hansen,<Hansen, James V.<ls-thn-eq> Representative 
Martin Meehan,<Meehan, Martin T.<ls-thn-eq> Representative Debbie 
Stabenow,<Stabenow, Debbie<ls-thn-eq> Representative David Obey,<Obey, 
David R.<ls-thn-eq> and Representative Lloyd Doggett,<Doggett, 
Lloyd<ls-thn-eq> whose efforts in past days have resulted in this 
significant victory.
    In the coming days and weeks, there will be other attempts by 
Congress to block the Federal Government's tobacco litigation with 
riders supported by tobacco companies. This bipartisan victory should be 
a model for Congress. The legal responsibility of the tobacco companies 
should be decided in the courts by the judicial process. I call upon 
Congress to reject the interests of big tobacco and permit justice to 
run its course.
