Remarks Following a Cabinet Meeting
March 19, 2002

    Thank you all for coming. We've had a very good Cabinet meeting. I 
want to thank my members of the Cabinet for discussing

a variety of topics. I heard from the Secretary of State<Powell, Colin 
L.> about the Vice President's<Cheney, Dick> visit 
and the Zinni<Zinni, Anthony> mission. So we're making 
progress. We heard, of course, from the Secretary of Defense<Rumsfeld, 
Donald H.> about our progress in the war on terror, and I 
appreciate his leadership and the bravery of the military.
    We talked about a lot of other issues. One thing I want to urge the 
Senate to do is to pass 245(i). This bill passed the House, and it now 
needs to pass the Senate. It is a bill which enhances our border 
security and, at the same time, says that if someone's living here 
legally, they won't have to leave the country in order to stay with 
their family. In other words, they won't have to leave the country, 
apply, and then come back to be with their family. We believe in family 
values. We believe good policy keeps families together. The House agreed 
with us, and the Senate ought to act. The Senate ought to get this done 
and particularly soon.
    I'm going to Mexico. I want to show our friends the Mexicans that we 
are compassionate about people who live here on a legal basis, that we 
don't disrupt the families for people who are here legally. So I think 
it's going to require some leadership in the Senate, and I look forward 
to seeing the Senate get this done soon.
    And I thank you all for coming today.

Note: The President spoke at 3:08 p.m. in the Cabinet Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle 
East Gen. Anthony Zinni, USMC (Ret.); and section 245(i) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act, which expired April 30, 2001. A tape 
was not available for verification of the content of these remarks.
