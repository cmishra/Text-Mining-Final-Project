Remarks on the Resignation of Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Adviser 
Karl Rove<Rove, Karl<ls-thn-eq>
August 13, 2007

    Karl Rove is moving on down the road. I've been talking to Karl for 
a while about his desire to spend more time with Darby<Rove, 
Darby<ls-thn-eq> and Andrew.<Rove, Andrew<ls-thn-eq> This is a family 
that has made enormous sacrifices, not only for our beloved State of 
Texas but for a country we both love.
    Now, we've been friends for a long time, and we're still going to be 
friends. I would call Karl Rove a dear friend. We've known each other as 
youngsters interested in serving our State. We worked together so we 
could be in a position to serve this country. And so I thank my friend. 
I'll be on the road behind you here in a little bit. I thank Darby<Rove, 
Darby<ls-thn-eq> and I thank Karl for making a tremendous sacrifice, and 
I wish you all the very best.

Note: The President spoke at 11:31 a.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Darby, wife, and Andrew, son, of 
Deputy Chief of Staff Rove. The transcript released by the Office of the 
Press Secretary also included the remarks of Deputy Chief of Staff Rove.
