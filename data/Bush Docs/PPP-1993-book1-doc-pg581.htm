Exchange With Reporters on Bosnia
May 6, 1993

    Q. Mr. President, the Serbs are now saying that they're going to cut 
off all but humanitarian supplies to the Bosnians. Do you have any 
reaction to that?
    The President. Well, that would be a good start. We'll see. We're 
working today on a lot of options. I want to see what happens over the 
next few days.
    Q. Have you gotten back to the Europeans, sir?
    The President. Oh, of course.
    Q. Today I mean, with either Mitterrand or Major?
    The President. I talked with President Mitterrand today.
    Q. Mr. President, is military action inevitable at this point? Do 
you have to do something like that?
    The President. I don't want to say anything else. You know what 
we're doing, and the Christopher mission is proceeding. And I don't have 
anything to add to what I said earlier except any welcome signs would be 
welcome. Let's see if anybody changes their conduct.
    Q. It doesn't sound like you're getting a lot of welcoming from the 
Europeans on the Christopher mission.
    The President. Oh, I have talked to Mitterrand today. We'll see what 
happens.

Note: The exchange began at 4 p.m. in the Oval
