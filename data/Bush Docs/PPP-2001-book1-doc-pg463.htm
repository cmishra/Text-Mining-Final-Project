Statement on House of Representatives Action on Legislation Regarding 
Unborn Victims of Violence
April 26, 2001

    America's children represent our greatest hope for the future. I 
commend the House for its bipartisan passing of the ``Unborn Victims of 
Violence Act,'' which will make it a separate felony to harm an unborn 
child in the course of committing any one of 68 Federal offenses. This 
legislation affirms our commitment to a culture of life, which welcomes 
and protects children.
