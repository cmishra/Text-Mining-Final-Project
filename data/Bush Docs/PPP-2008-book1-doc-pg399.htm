Message on the Observance of Nowruz
March 19, 2008

    I send greetings to those celebrating Nowruz.
    For the millions of people who trace their heritage to Iran, Iraq, 
Afghanistan, Turkey, Pakistan, India, and Central Asia, Nowruz is a time 
to celebrate the New Year with the arrival of spring. This cherished and 
ancient festival brings together family and friends to reflect on what 
has come before and celebrate a season of new beginnings.
    Our country is proud to be a land where individuals from many 
different cultures can pass their traditions on to future generations. 
The diversity of America brings joy to our citizens and strengthens our 
Nation during Nowruz and throughout the year.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes to all those 
celebrating Nowruz, both here in the United States and abroad. May the 
year ahead be filled with peace and many blessings.

                                                          George W. Bush
