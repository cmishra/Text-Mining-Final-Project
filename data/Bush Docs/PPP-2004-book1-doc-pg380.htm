Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives on Funding for the 
Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States 
Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction
March 12, 2004

Dear Mr. Speaker:
    I am notifying the Congress of my intent to use funds provided in 
Public Law 107-38, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for 
Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, FY 
2001, for the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United 
States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction (the ``Commission'').
    At this time, $4 million will be transferred from the Emergency 
Response Fund for the Commission. As provided in Public Law 107-38, 
these funds will be made available to the Commission immediately.
    The details of this action are set forth in the enclosed letter from 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
