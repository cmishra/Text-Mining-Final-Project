Statement on Congressional Action on Africa and Caribbean Basin Trade 
Legislation
April 14, 2000

    The bipartisan agreement reached by the House and Senate on the 
Africa and Caribbean Basin trade legislation is a major step toward 
enactment of these historic initiatives. This bill is a win-win

economic reform, reduce poverty, and broaden participation in the 
benefits of the global economy. I congratulate congressional leaders 
from both parties who worked hard to reach this agreement. I urge

final approval can occur during the first week after its Easter recess.
