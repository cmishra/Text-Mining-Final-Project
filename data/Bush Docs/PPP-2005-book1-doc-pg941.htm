Remarks at a Reception for Black Music Month
June 6, 2005

    Thank you all. Welcome to the White House. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are honored to have some of the country's finest 
entertainers with us tonight. We're here to celebrate Black Music Month, 
and we thank you all for coming.
    For decades, Presidents have taken pride in welcoming black 
musicians to play in this house, and the performers seem to enjoy this 
place when they come. [Laughter] One of the greatest black musicians to 
visit the White House was Dizzy Gillespie. He liked it so much here he 
became a write-in candidate for President in 1964. [Laughter] His 
platform included jazz in schools and Miles Davis as the head of the 
CIA. [Laughter] I'm not making that up. [Laughter]
    Teresa,<Hairston, Teresa<ls-thn-eq> thank you very much for emceeing 
this event. I really thank our entertainers. You were great. Thank you 
for filling this house--[applause]. I want to thank the members of my 
Cabinet who have joined us. I appreciate Senator George Allen<Allen, 
George<ls-thn-eq> from Virginia and Congressman Bobby Scott<Scott, 
Robert Cortez<ls-thn-eq> from Virginia for joining us as well. A lot of 
distinguished Americans here, and we're really glad you're here. 
Welcome.
    Each June, we honor the great contributions that black musicians 
have made to America and to the world. The music of African American 
artists has enhanced our lives and created some of the Nation's most 
treasured art forms, and that's why we celebrate this month. From gospel 
music to blues to jazz to rock and roll, the songs of America's black 
musicians have defined their times and have enriched our culture.
    It's hard to imagine America without the genius of Louis Armstrong 
and Dizzy Gillespie, the voices of Lena Horne<Horne, Lena<ls-thn-eq> and 
Diana Ross<Ross, Diana<ls-thn-eq> and Ella Fitzgerald and so many 
others. We just can't envision our country without those voices. Their 
achievements remind us that our diversity makes our country strong.
    The artists we celebrate this month use music to lift the human 
spirit. Black music in America began with the work songs and spirituals 
of people held in slavery. Their songs bore witness to cruelty and 
earthly injustice, and yet in them, we hear the voice of faith lifted up 
to God. That music could have come only from the unique experience of 
African Americans, yet it speaks a language that all Americans 
understand.
    The Psalms tell us to ``make a joyful noise unto the Lord.'' You 
lived up to the Psalms. [Laughter] Smokie,<Robinson, Ben 
``Smokie''<ls-thn-eq> Mary<Campbell, Erica<ls-thn-eq> Mary,<Campbell, 
Tina<ls-thn-eq> and Donnie<McClurkin, Donnie<ls-thn-eq> understand that 
part of the Gospel. [Laughter] These gospel artists have found a modern 
audience for a timeless music, and they have never forgot their purpose. 
Pastor Donnie likes to say, ``If you ever want to get anybody in touch 
with God, sing to them.'' He has a whole congregation on Long Island 
saying amen when he sings, kind of like he had in the White House. 
[Laughter]
    At its best, music speaks to every heart, and some moving 
performances by black

musicians have happened right here at the White House. You just 
witnessed one. In 1882, a black choir called the Fisk Jubilee Singers 
moved President Arthur to tears with their performance of ``Safe in the 
Arms of Jesus.'' Sissieretta Jones, the daughter of a slave, sang opera 
here in the White House for President Benjamin Harrison. In 1939, Marian 
Anderson performed ``Ave Maria'' for Franklin Roosevelt right here in 
this room. President Roosevelt said that ``music can make us all more 
vividly aware of the common humanity which is ours.'' Let history 
record, you had me jumping in my seat. [Laughter]
    Throughout our history, African American artists have created music 
with the power to change hearts and reshape our national conscience. The 
songs of black musicians heralded social change. Music like jazz and 
blues communicated across racial barriers. That music began in America's 
country churches and urban clubs of Chicago, New Orleans, and Harlem. 
Today, it is cherished here at home and around the world.
    And our black musicians continue to inspire us and bring us 
together. Across the country, American cities and towns will celebrate 
Black Music Month with their own festivals. We're just a small part of a 
larger celebration. From the Chicago Blues Festival to the B.B. King 
Homecoming Festival in Mississippi to the JVC Jazz Festival in New York 
City, people of all races and ages and creeds will come together on warm 
June nights to celebrate these musicians and their music.
    Today, African American artists have continued to set standards of 
originality and creativity. The incredible talents of black musicians 
keep lifting their art and lifting the souls of America. We heard that 
talent today. We're grateful to all the black musicians who have brought 
such beauty and pride to our country, and we're grateful to you all.
    May God bless you all.

Note: The President spoke at 5:37 p.m. in the East Room at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Teresa Hairston, founder and 
publisher, Gospel Today; and entertainers Smokie Norful, Mary Mary, and 
Rev. Donnie McClurkin. The Black Music Month proclamation of June 1 is 
listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
