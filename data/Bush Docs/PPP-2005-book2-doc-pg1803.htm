Statement on the Resignation of Andrew S. Natsios<Natsios, Andrew 
S.<ls-thn-eq> as Administrator of the United States Agency for 
International Development
December 2, 2005

    Andrew Natsios has served as a key member of my administration for 
more than 4 years. He has exemplified the compassion and generosity of 
the American people and our deep commitment to helping and improving the 
lives of those who are suffering. Under his leadership, USAID has 
implemented important reforms and helped us combat AIDS and malaria, 
rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq, provide humanitarian aid in Sudan, and 
assist victims of the tsunami and the recent devastating earthquake in 
South Asia. I thank him for his dedicated service to our country, and I 
wish him and his family well.
