Appointment for the National Cancer Advisory Board
September 8, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to appoint Barbara K. 
Rimer, Dr. P.H., of Duke University, as Chair and member of the National 
Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB).
    ``The NCAB plays a critical role by providing advice on the Federal 
cancer research effort,'' the President said. ``Dr. Rimer has 
demonstrated her ability to meld insight from the biological and 
behavioral sciences into new approaches to cancer control, and I look 
forward to her leadership of the NCAB.''

Note: A biography of the appointee was made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
