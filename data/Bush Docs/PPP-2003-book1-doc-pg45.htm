Message to the Senate Transmitting an Agreement Amending the Canada-
United States Treaty on Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna Vessels and Port 
Privileges
January 9, 2003

To the Senate of the United States:
    With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to 
ratification, I transmit herewith the Agreement Amending the Treaty 
Between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of Canada on Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna Vessels and Port 
Privileges done at Washington May 26, 1981 (the ``Treaty''), effected by 
an exchange of diplomatic notes at Washington on July 17, 2002, and 
August 13, 2002 (the ``Agreement''). I am also enclosing, for the 
information of the Senate, the report of the Secretary of State on the 
Agreement and a related agreement, effected by an exchange of notes at 
Washington on August 21, 2002, and September 10, 2002, amending the 
Annexes to the Treaty; this related agreement was concluded pursuant to 
Article VII of the Treaty.
    The Treaty currently permits unlimited fishing for albacore tuna by 
vessels of each Party in waters under the jurisdiction of the other 
Party. The Agreement amends the Treaty to allow for a limitation on such 
fishing necessitated by changing circumstances.
    The U.S. fishing and processing industries strongly support the 
amendment to the Treaty. The amendment not only allows the Parties to 
redress the imbalance of benefits received by U.S. fishers that has 
developed in the operation of the Treaty, but also preserves U.S. 
interests under the Treaty, including the interest of U.S. fishers to 
fish in Canadian waters at times when the albacore stock moves 
northward, the interest of U.S. processors to continue to receive 
Canadian catches for processing, and the U.S. interest in being able to 
conserve and manage the stock.
    The recommended legislation necessary to implement the Agreement 
will be submitted separately to the Congress.
    I recommend that the Senate give favorable consideration to this 
Agreement and give its advice and consent to ratification at an early 
date.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 January 9, 2003.
