Remarks at a Martin Luther King, Jr., Holiday Volunteer Event
January 15, 2007

    This has been my honor to be here. One of the things that Mrs. King 
wanted was for MLK Day to be a day of service. It is not a day off, but 
it's a day on. And so I'm here at Cardozo High School to thank the 
hundreds of people who have showed up to serve the country by 
volunteering.
    And right here in the library, we're with a group of folks who are 
sending postcards to folks who have been affected by Katrina, cards of 
hope, an opportunity for a citizen here to say to somebody in the New 
Orleans area, ``We care about you, people are thinking about you,'' and 
all in the hopes of lifting somebody's spirit.
    And so I not only want to thank the folks involved in this project 
and thank the Attorney General<Gonzales, Alberto R.<ls-thn-eq> for 
volunteering, but I encourage people all around the country to seize any 
opportunity they can to helpsomebody in need. And by helping somebody in 
need, you're honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King. And by helping 
somebody in need, you're really helping yourself because you're lifting 
your soul.
    And so I want to thank the principal<Ballard, Reginald<ls-thn-eq> of 
this fine high school; I want to thank the organizers of the event; and 
I want to thank the volunteers, young and old, for setting aside time to 
make somebody else's life better.
    Thank you all for coming.

Note: The President spoke at 10:52 a.m. at Cardozo High School. In his 
remarks, he referred to Reginald Ballard, principal, Cardozo High 
School. The Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday proclamation of 
January 11 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
