Nomination for United States Executive Director of the International 
Monetary Fund
September 23, 1993

    The President announced today that he intends to nominate Columbia 
University professor Karen Lissakers to be the U.S. Executive Director 
of the International Monetary Fund. The Executive Director represents 
the United States on the 24-member board of executive directors, which 
sets policy for the IMF.
    ``As the largest shareholder in the IMF, the United States has a 
special responsibility for its operations,'' said the President. ``Karen 
Lissakers has proven that she is up to the task of representing our 
interests. I am confident that she will shine in this position.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
