Statement on Establishing the Klamath River Basin Federal Working Group
March 1, 2002

    A prolonged drought and complex Federal and State legal issues have 
made for difficult times in the Klamath River Basin. Today I am 
establishing the Klamath River Basin Federal Working Group to address 
concerns raised by farmers, ranchers, fishermen, tribes, and others 
affected by these difficult conditions. I have directed Secretary 
Norton,<Norton, Gale A.> Secretary Veneman,<Veneman, 
Ann> Secretary Evans,<Evans, Donald L.> and CEQ 
Chairman Connaughton<Connaughton, James> to advise me of the 
immediate and long-term actions necessary to enhance water quality and 
quantity and to address the other complex economic and natural resource 
issues in the Klamath River Basin. I have directed the Working Group to 
begin their efforts immediately. I want to thank Senator Gordon 
Smith<Smith, Gordon> and Congressman Greg Walden<Walden, 
Greg> for their commitment to working together to find a 
lasting solution that meets the needs of the Klamath River Basin.
