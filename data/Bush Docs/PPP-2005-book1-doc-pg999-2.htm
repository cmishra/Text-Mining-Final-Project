Remarks at the Congressional Picnic
June 15, 2005

    Thank you all for coming tonight. I think we're going to have a 
pretty special picnic here on the South Lawn. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and Lynne<Cheney, Lynne<ls-thn-eq> and Dick<Cheney, 
Dick<ls-thn-eq> and I are really pleased you're here. It's a chance to 
say thanks to the Members of Congress and their families.
    I appreciate the Marine Band. I hope you've enjoyed them as much as 
I've enjoyed listening to them upstairs.
    So, enjoy the food. In about 45 minutes or so, we're going to have a 
celebration of American musicals, at the tent down there below. We hope 
you join us. WETA is going to film it, so make sure you look pretty. 
[Laughter]
    But thanks for coming. May God bless you all and your families. Glad 
you're here.

Note: The President spoke at 6:56 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House.
