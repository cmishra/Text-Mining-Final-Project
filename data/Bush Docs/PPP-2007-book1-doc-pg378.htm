Message on the Observance of Passover, 5767
April 2, 2007

    This day shall be for you a memorial day, and you shall keep it as a 
feast to the Lord; throughout your generations, as a statute forever, 
you shall keep it as a feast.

                                                            Exodus 12:14

    I send greetings to those celebrating Passover, beginning at sundown 
on April 2.
    During Passover, Jews around the world gather with family and 
friends to remember God's deliverance of the Children of Israel from 
bondage more than 3,000 years ago. To celebrate their Exodus from Egypt, 
the Jewish people commemorate the Passover each year by reading the 
Haggadah, singing traditional songs, and sharing the Seder meal. Through 
these traditions, the Jewish people express their gratitude for God's 
redemption and the blessings of freedom, and they ensure that their 
heritage is passed on to future generations. Passover is a time of hope 
and faith and a time to reflect on God's boundless love and endless 
mercy.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes for a 
blessed Passover.

                                                          George W. Bush
