Statement on Disaster Assistance for Floods in California
January 10, 1995

    Tonight I have declared that a major disaster exists in California 
caused by the damaging floods in northern and southern California. I 
have directed Federal Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee 
Witt to oversee the Federal response in the recovery.
    FEMA officials are already working closely with State and local 
officials to ensure a quick response to this flood. Director Witt is in 
California making sure disaster funds begin to flow quickly to help the 
people affected by the flood

damage. These funds will help to begin the process of recovery.
    Californians have a resilient spirit and great sense of community. 
You have shown over the past year during the earthquake, the fires, and 
now the current floods that you are a people that come together in times 
of crisis. The American people support you as you would them in a 
similar time of need. Our hearts are with the thousands of victims 
affected by the floods and the family members of those who have died.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
disaster assistance for California.
