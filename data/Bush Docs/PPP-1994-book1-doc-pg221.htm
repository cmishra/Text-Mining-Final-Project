Appointment for Director of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting
February 9, 1994

    The President today announced the appointment of Richard M. Lobo to 
be Director of the U.S. Information Agency's Office of Cuba 
Broadcasting, which manages Radio and TV Marti. The two services provide 
a mix of Spanish-language news, feature, cultural, and entertainment 
programming to the people of Cuba.
    ``Richard Lobo's 35 years of experience in journalism, broadcast 
management, and community affairs make him very well suited for this 
job,'' said the President. ``Our administration honors the memory of 
Jose Marti, whose birthday we marked last week, and will continue our 
efforts in support of freedom and democracy for the Cuban people. Radio 
and TV Marti are an integral part of those efforts.''

Note: A biography of the appointee was made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
