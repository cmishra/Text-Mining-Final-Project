a successful new round of global trade talks. A successful round will 
include bringing down barriers in agriculture, manufacturing, and

the environment. And as I said in Seattle, a successful WTO must be more 
open and accessible to all citizens around the world.
    I am determined to move forward on the path of free trade and 
economic growth while ensuring a human face is put on the global 
economy.
