Statement on Proposed Juvenile Crime Legislation
August 5, 1999

    Months after the tragedy at Columbine and the day before they are 
set to recess, Congress will finally begin the conference on juvenile 
crime legislation. Let's show our children that, when it comes to their 
safety, Washington will not take a break. I urge the conferees to stay 
in Washington and finish work on the bill during the August recess. This 
is a vital opportunity to take commonsense steps to keep guns out of the 
wrong hands, prevent youth violence, and steer young people away from 
crime. They should send me a balanced and bipartisan juvenile crime 
bill, with the Senate-passed gun provisions, so we can give our Nation's 
parents more peace of mind as our children return to school.
