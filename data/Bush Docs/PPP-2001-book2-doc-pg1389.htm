Statement on Signing the Energy and Water Development Appropriations 
Act, 2002
November 12, 2001

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2311, the ``Energy and Water 
Development Appropriations Act, 2002.''
    I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has gone into producing this 
Act. The bill abides by the agreed upon aggregate funding level for 
Fiscal Year 2002 of $686 billion. It provides funding for several 
important programs with significant national benefits including:

  <bullet>   key research projects designed to develop new energy 
            technologies and improve the efficiency of existing energy 
            technologies, such as for solar and renewable energy 
            production, as called for in the National Energy Policy 
            report;
  <bullet>   nonproliferation programs that seek to prevent nuclear 
            materials and other weapons of mass destruction from falling 
            into the hands of terrorists and rogue states;
  <bullet>   stockpile stewardship, which is critical to maintaining the 
            safety, reliability, and performance of our nuclear weapons 
            stockpile; and
  <bullet>   water resources development and management projects, and 
            programs for commercial navigation, flood damage reduction, 
            and environmental restoration and enhancement.

    Section 303 of the bill purports to require congressional approval 
before executive branch execution of aspects of the bill. I will 
interpret such provisions to require notification only, since any other 
interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS v. 
Chadha. Provisions of H.R. 2311 that purport to remove my authority to 
oversee the activities of the Army Corps of Engineers will be construed 
consistent with my constitutional authority to supervise the unitary 
executive branch.
    My Administration appreciates that the Congress has worked 
expeditiously during this difficult and trying time in our Nation's 
history to consider the FY 2002 appropriations bills. Now, through a 
renewed sense of bipartisanship, the Congress and the Administration 
must work together to ensure the timely enactment of the remaining 
bills.

                                                          George W. Bush
