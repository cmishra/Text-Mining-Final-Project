Statement on the Death of George Christian
December 2, 2002

    George Christian<Christian, George<ls-thn-eq> was an honorable, 
decent, and kind man who represented the best of public service, and he 
was devoted to his family. He was a statesman of the highest integrity. 
He also was a great Texan, whose wise counsel was sought by generations 
of leaders. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in offering our most 
heartfelt condolences to the Christian family. We are grateful for the 
life he lived and the many positive contributions he made to his country 
and to his State.
