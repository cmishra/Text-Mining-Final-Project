Statement on the Death of Carlos Marin<Marin, Carlos<ls-thn-eq>
September 18, 2008

    I am deeply saddened by the tragic death of Carlos Marin, a 
dedicated public servant who died while fulfilling his responsibilities 
as United States Commissioner of the International Boundary and Water 
Commission, United States and Mexico. Carlos Marin was an accomplished 
engineer and capable leader who achieved the American Dream while 
serving at the Commission for over two decades. He quickly rose through 
the ranks as he worked hard to effectively apply the boundary and water 
treaties between our country and Mexico. I appreciate his efforts to 
protect our Nation's interests, raise agency morale, and establish solid 
and transparent relationships with his Mexican counterparts. I am 
honored that he served in my administration.
    My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Rosa Alva<Marin, 
Rosa<ls-thn-eq> and the entire Marin family.
    Mexican Commissioner Arturo Herrera,<Herrera, Arturo<ls-thn-eq> Jake 
Brisbin, Jr.,<Brisbin, Jake, Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and Matthew Peter 
Juneau<Juneau, Matthew P.<ls-thn-eq> were also killed in this tragic 
plane crash. Their families are also in our thoughts and prayers during 
this difficult time.
