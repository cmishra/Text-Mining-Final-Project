Statement on the 1998 Uniform Crime Report
October 17, 1999

    The 1998 uniform crime report released by the FBI today shows that 
serious crime has continued to fall in every region of our Nation for 
the seventh straight year. The murder rate is at its lowest since 1967. 
The overall violent crime rate is down, and gun crimes, rapes, 
robberies, assaults, and juvenile crime have all dropped to their lowest 
levels in over a decade. This is good news for America's families, and 
it shows we can indeed turn the tide on crime.
    My administration's strategy of 100,000 more police, fewer guns in 
the hands of criminals, thanks to the Brady law, and more tools for 
communities to combat crime is working to make our streets safer and our 
communities stronger. But tragedies from Littleton to Los Angeles show 
that we must do more to protect our communities from gun violence. Even 
as crime falls, we must not let down our guard. That is why we must 
redouble our efforts to build on what works by fully funding our COPS 
program to put more police on the street and by passing commonsense gun 
legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Together we can make 
America the safest big nation in the world.

Note: This statement was embargoed for release until 6 p.m., October 17.
