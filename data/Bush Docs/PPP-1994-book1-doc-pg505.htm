Exchange With Reporters in Deerfield Beach, Florida
March 21, 1994

North Korea

    Q. Anything new on North Korea, Mr. President?
    The President. Let me just say, about North Korea, the IAEA has made 
their judgment; now there will be consultations at the U.N.
    I think you know--I think President Kim has confirmed that I sent 
him a letter at the end of last week. And we have agreed that it is in 
our national interest and the interest of the security of the people of 
South Korea and the security of our armed forces there to proceed with 
the Patriot deployment, so we will do that.
    As to the next issues, I think we have to just wait and see what 
will happen. I can't say more today. We're going to have to work on this 
on a day-to-day basis. I will say again, I want to emphasize this 
decision on the Patriots is purely defensive in nature. But it is 
appropriate--General Luck has said he thinks it's necessary as the 
continuing modernization of our forces proceeds. What happens now is 
still in the court of the North Koreans, and we must hope that they will 
do the right thing.
    Thank you.

Note: The exchange began at 12:47 p.m. at Century Village East. In his 
remarks, the President referred to President Kim Yong-sam of South Korea 
and Gen. Gary E. Luck, USA, commander, U.S. forces, Korea. A tape was 
not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
