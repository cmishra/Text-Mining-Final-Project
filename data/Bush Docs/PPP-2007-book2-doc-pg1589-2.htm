Message Sending Holiday Greetings to Members of the Armed Forces
December 21, 2007

To the Men and Women of the United States Armed Forces
    On behalf of a grateful Nation, Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
send our best wishes for the holidays.
    In this season of giving, we remember our duty to others, and we see 
that sense of duty fulfilled in the men and women who wear our Nation's 
uniform. Our country owes you a debt of gratitude for your courage and 
resolve to serve the cause of peace. Americans are proud of your 
dedicated service, and I am proud to be the Commander in Chief of the 
greatest force for freedom in the history of the world.
    Our Nation is thankful for the many sacrifices you and your families 
make every day. During the holidays and throughout the coming year, we 
ask the Almighty to bestow His protection and care on you and your loved 
ones. We pray for your safety and for liberty, justice, and peace on 
Earth.

May God bless you, and may God continue to bless America.

                                                          George W. Bush
