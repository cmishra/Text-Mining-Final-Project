Statement on Congressional Action on Proposed Education Flexibility 
Partnership Legislation
April 21, 1999

    I am pleased that a little more than a year after I proposed 
national ed-flex legislation to the Nation's Governors, an overwhelming 
majority in Congress has passed a solid ed-flex bill. I look forward to 
signing it without delay. This bill will offer States more flexibility

early grades. The bipartisan work on this legislation shows we can and 
must work together to improve our Nation's schools.

Nation's education agenda: finishing the job of hiring 100,000 well-
prepared teachers to reduce class size, passing my initiative to help 
build and modernize 6,000 public schools, and reauthorizing the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act with my plan to hold States and 
school districts accountable for results.
