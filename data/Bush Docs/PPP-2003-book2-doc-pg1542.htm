Statement on Senate Action To Block Votes on Judicial Nominations
November 14, 2003

    Today's partisan action to block up-or-down votes on Justice 
Priscilla Owen,<Owen, Priscilla Richman<ls-thn-eq> Judge Carolyn 
Kuhl,<Kuhl, Carolyn<ls-thn-eq> and Justice Janice Rogers Brown<Brown, 
Janice Rogers<ls-thn-eq> is inconsistent with the Senate's 
constitutional responsibility and is just plain wrong. Once again, a 
partisan minority of Senators has thwarted the will of the majority and 
stood in the way of voting on superb judicial nominees.

    These obstructionist tactics are shameful, unfair, and have become 
all too common. At a time when the American people have important issues 
backlogged in the courts, partisan Senators are playing politics with 
the judicial process at the expense of timely justice for the American 
people.
    I commend Senate Republicans, especially Leader Frist,<Frist, 
Bill<ls-thn-eq> Chairman Hatch,<Hatch, Orrin G.<ls-thn-eq> and Senator 
Santorum,<Santorum, Rick<ls-thn-eq> for their leadership and commitment 
to the Constitution and basic fairness. During their 40-hour debate, 
these Senators have focused on the damaging vacancies that exist on the 
Federal courts of appeals, the highly qualified individuals I have 
nominated to serve, and the Senate's obligation to vote on every 
judicial nominee.
    No matter who is President or which party controls the Senate, the 
American people deserve a well-functioning, independent judiciary and a 
commitment by all Senators to live up to their constitutional 
obligation.
