Statement on Signing the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act
August 13, 1997

    Today, I signed into law H.R. 1585, the ``Stamp Out Breast Cancer 
Act.'' This legislation requires the U.S. Postal Service to establish a 
special rate of postage for first-class mail that patrons may use 
voluntarily to contribute to funding for breast cancer research. Special 
postal stamps will be made available for this purpose.

    Research and the prompt application of research results are the 
strongest weapons we have against breast cancer. Today, breast cancer 
remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women. It affects one 
in eight women in their lifetimes and has touched the families of nearly 
every American, including my own. But we are making great strides in the 
study of this disease. Our goal must be to find a cure and a way to 
prevent breast cancer in the near future.
    The bill I am signing into law today builds on this Administration's 
long history of support for breast cancer research and prevention. 
Between 1993 and 1997, funding for breast cancer research at NIH 
increased 75 percent. We will work to ensure that the new funds from 
this legislation are not used as a replacement for our current 
commitment. It creates another way for Americans to further support the 
important research that will make a difference in the lives of millions 
of families.

Note: H.R. 1585, approved August 13, was assigned Public Law No. 105-41.
