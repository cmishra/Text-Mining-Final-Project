     I want to thank the leaders of two of America's strongest allies, 
the President of South Korea and the Prime Minister of Japan, for 
joining in this trilateral discussion. It is an important dialog between 
three democracies, all of which are committed to peace and security. I 
look forward to discussing a wide range of issues with these two 
leaders. There is no doubt, when we work together, we can bring peace 
and stability and prosperity for our peoples.
     And so I want to thank you all very much for joining. I appreciate 
your time, and I'm looking forward to our dialog. Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 1:02 p.m. at the Sheraton Hanoi.
