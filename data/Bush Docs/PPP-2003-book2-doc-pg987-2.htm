Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Waiver on the Extension 
of Normal Trade Relations Status for Turkmenistan
August 8, 2003

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    I hereby transmit the document referred to in subsection 402(c)(2) 
of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to a waiver of the 
application of subsections 402(a) and (b) of that Act to Turkmenistan.
    I report in that document my determination that such a waiver will 
substantially promote the objectives of section 402. I have instructed 
the Secretary of State to provide a copy of that determination to the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate. I 
have also provided a separate report, prepared by my Administration, 
indicating that I have received the assurances with respect to the 
emigration practices of Turkmenistan required by section 402(c) (2)(B) 
of the Act.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The Executive order and Presidential determination of August 8 
with respect to Turkmenistan are listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
