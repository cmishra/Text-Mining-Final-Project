Statement on Senate Action on the Line Item Veto
March 28, 1996

    I want to commend the Senate for passing legislation to give the 
President line item veto authority. While not a perfect bill, the 
conference report as passed by the Senate will give Presidents the 
ability to cut wasteful Government spending and special interest tax 
provisions.
    I have advocated the line item veto for a very long time. I had the 
line item veto when I was Governor of Arkansas; I advocated the line 
item veto when I ran for President; and I have pursued it since becoming 
President.
    The President, no matter what party, needs the line item veto to 
ensure that our public resources are put to the best possible uses 
during these times of tight budgets. While I note that this authority 
does not become effective until the next Congress, I urge the House to 
follow the Senate's lead and pass the conference report now.
