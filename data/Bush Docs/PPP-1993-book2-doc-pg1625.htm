Statement on the Death of General James H. Doolittle
September 28, 1993

    Lt. General James H. Doolittle's life spanned a period of American 
history that combined vast technological advancements with unparalleled 
change in our Nation's world role. At every step along the way, General 
Doolittle was among this Nation's trusted leaders.
    General Doolittle was a pioneer in aviation. An accomplished and 
acclaimed airman in the years between the World Wars, he helped push the 
envelope of aviation and ensured that the United States was at the 
forefront of this emerging technology. When America entered the Second 
World War, General Doolittle's daring and courage emboldened an anxious 
and uncertain Nation. He gave the world its first example of the steel 
that would allow the United States to lead the Allies to victory. In 
peacetime, he again served the Nation as a leader in industry and 
aerospace.
    General Doolittle's love for his Nation will long survive him. His 
willingness to serve his country despite personal danger will long stand 
as an example of the grit and determination that has driven our Nation 
since its founding. Hillary joins me in mourning the loss of a patriot, 
a pioneer, and a hero.

Note: The related proclamation of September 30 is listed in Appendix D 
at the end of this volume.
