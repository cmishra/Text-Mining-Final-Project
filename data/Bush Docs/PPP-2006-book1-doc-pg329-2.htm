Letter to Congressional Leaders on Extending Generalized System of 
Preferences Benefits to Liberia
February 22, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    I am writing to inform you of my intent to add Liberia to the list 
of beneficiary developing countries and to the list of least-developed 
beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP). I have carefully considered the criteria identified 
in sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. In light 
of these criteria, I have determined that it is appropriate to end the 
suspension of Liberia as a GSP beneficiary developing country and to 
extend least-developed ben-
eficiary developing country benefits to Liberia.
    This notice is submitted in accordance with section 502(f) of the 
Trade Act of 1974.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the 
Senate. The related proclamation of February 22 is listed in Appendix D 
at the end of this volume.
