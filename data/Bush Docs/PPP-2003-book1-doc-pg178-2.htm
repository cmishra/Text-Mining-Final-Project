Statement on the National Strategy To Secure Cyberspace and the National 
Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key 
Assets
February 14, 2003

    The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace and the National Strategy 
for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets 
will help us protect America from those who would do us harm, whether 
through physical destruction or by attacking our infrastructures through 
cyberspace.
    These strategies recognize that the majority of our critical assets 
and infrastructures, such as those in the banking, telecommunications, 
energy, and transportation sectors, are privately owned and operated. 
The strategies outline Federal efforts and State and local roles in 
securing the Nation's critical infrastructures and identify 
opportunities for partnership with the private sector. The Department of 
Homeland Security will take the lead in accomplishing many of the 
objectives of these strategies. Other departments and agencies also have 
important roles to play. I encourage everyone, government at all levels, 
industry, and

private citizens to continue to work together to make our Nation secure.
