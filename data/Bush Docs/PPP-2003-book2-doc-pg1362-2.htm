Adunyadet<ls-thn-eq> and Queen Sirikit<Queen Sirikit<ls-thn-eq> of 
Thailand in Bangkok
October 19, 2003

    Thank you, Your Majesty, for your warm and gracious welcome. Thanks 
also to Her Majesty the Queen for hosting this event. I thank as well 
the Grand Chamberlain who earlier today led us on a tour of the 
magnificent Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Laura and I have been seeing 
the famous hospitality of the Thai people, and we are most grateful.
    The United States of America deeply values our alliance with the 
Kingdom of Thailand. Your Majesty, the world has changed greatly since 
your reign began 57 years ago. Yet thanks to your enlightened leadership 
and steady hand, the friendship between our two nations has remained 
constant.
    Over the decades, we worked together to build the foundations of 
liberty in this region, rule of law, respect for human rights, free 
enterprise, and peace. Today, we continue to strive toward the same 
goals in the face of different challenges. Nations are working together 
in Afghanistan and Iraq. Royal Thai troops have served well in both 
places, helping Afghans and Iraqis make the transition from tyranny to 
self-government.
    The emergence of these free nations is a setback for terrorism and 
radicalism. By sharing the duties of our coalition, Thailand is 
contributing to peace and stability in those two countries and 
increasing the security of all free nations.
    Thailand has played a vital role in East Timor, helping create a new 
nation to bring dignity to nearly a million people and to stabilize an 
entire region. You are fully joined in the fight against the drug trade 
and against HIV/AIDS and other diseases.
    Thailand is a principled, generous nation, rising to meet the 
challenges of our time. Thailand's positive influence in the world

is inspired by the fine example of service that Your Majesty and Her 
Majesty the Queen set for your people. It's also vivid in the great, 
humane traditions of this land. America is honored to have your 
friendship.
    So I offer a toast to Your Majesties, to the royal family, and to 
your great nation.

Note: The President spoke at 7:40 p.m. in the Chakri Throne Room at the 
Grand Palace. A tape was not available for verification of the content
