Remarks Prior to a Discussion on Education in Monrovia
February 21, 2008

    President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf<Johnson Sirleaf, Ellen<ls-thn-eq> of 
Liberia. Mr. President, Mrs. Bush, fellow Liberians: We have been 
pleased that with the support of the United States Government to our 
education rebuilding process, we can now say that we're beginning to see 
the signs of progress.
    Mr. President, today you will be listening to some of the 
beneficiaries who will be sharing their experience with you. They've 
been supported through the United States Agency for International 
Development, the President's Africa Education Initiative. Liberia 
currently receives assistance for adult learners, primary school 
students, school infrastructure, teacher training, the accelerated 
learning program, and improvement of higher education.
    Thank you for being here with us. And thank you for all that you do, 
for helping us to rebuild our educational system.
    President Bush. Thank you, Madam President.<Johnson Sirleaf, 
Ellen<ls-thn-eq> [Applause] Does that mean you want me to speak? 
[Laughter]
    President Johnson Sirleaf.<Johnson Sirleaf, Ellen<ls-thn-eq> You 
speak a little bit, and I'll introduce the----
    President Bush. Okay, good, yes. The President<Johnson Sirleaf, 
Ellen<ls-thn-eq> said, we have met four times since she's been 
President. I said out there at the parade grounds that every time, I'm a 
better person for it, since she's a--[applause]. This is the last event 
on the last stop of what has been a comprehensive trip around the 
continent of Africa. And it's a fitting--fitting that we talk about 
education as the last subject to discuss.
    First of all, I just want you to know that, Madam President,<Johnson 
Sirleaf, Ellen<ls-thn-eq> we admire you, and we appreciate your 
leadership. I particularly appreciate your commitment to liberty and 
freedom. Now, the problem is, of course, it's one thing to be for 
freedom, but it's really important to have a healthy, educated group of 
folks to be able to realize the blessings of freedom.
    And so our desire in the United States is to answer the universal 
call to love a neighbor and to help those--I believe to whom much is 
given, much is required. A lot has been given the United States of 
America, and I firmly believe it's in our national interest to help 
others not only realize the blessings of liberty but to fight disease 
when we find it and to deal with illiteracy where we encounter it.
    And so our initiative on malaria or the AIDS initiative is all aimed 
at saving lives, which in essence helps save societies. And same thing 
with our education initiative. And so we really appreciate you all 
coming to share your message with us. I hope you're not nervous. 
[Laughter] I bet you're

not, because all you got to do is tell us what's on your mind. Just 
share your stories, and I think people will find that they're most 
interested.
    But what you must know here in Liberia is that the United States of 
America is with you, and we'll stay with you because we want you to 
succeed. It's in the interest of the United States of America that 
Liberia do well. And so, Madam President,<Johnson Sirleaf, 
Ellen<ls-thn-eq> we are--[applause]--we're proud to stand with you. 
We're not going to tell you what to do because you're plenty competent. 
I believe African leaders can run African countries. But I do believe 
the United States of America can help. And that's exactly what we're 
going to discuss today, Madam President.
    So thank you very much for that introduction. And Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> is thrilled to be here as well. She is the librarian in 
the family. [Laughter]
    President Johnson Sirleaf.<Johnson Sirleaf, Ellen<ls-thn-eq> That's 
right.

[At this point, the discussion continued, and no transcript was 
provided.]

Note: The President spoke at 3:04 p.m. at the University of Liberia.
