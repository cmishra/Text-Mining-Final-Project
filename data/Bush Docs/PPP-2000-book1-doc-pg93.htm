Statement on James<Barksdale, James<ls-thn-eq> and Sally 
Barksdale's<Barksdale, Sally<ls-thn-eq> Pledge to the University of 
Mississippi
January 20, 2000

    Hillary and I applaud James and Sally Barksdale for their dedication 
and leadership on behalf of the cause of literacy. Their generous pledge 
of $100 million to the University of Mississippi will provide 
schoolchildren in that State--especially those in the most needy 
schools--with access to new reading programs, train teachers in reading 
education, and promote efforts to target and help students struggling to 
learn to read. Their generosity is an example of the extraordinary role 
philanthropy plays in providing a better future for our children, 
families, and country.
