Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto of Japan in Manila, Philippines
November 24, 1996

Discussions With President Jiang Zemin of China

    Q. Could you give us your assessment of your meeting with the 
Chinese leader?
    The President. Well, I'm sure you've gotten a report. I think it 
went very well. It was a good meeting, and I think that the next steps 
were appropriate.
    Q. You're looking forward, then, to going to Beijing?
    The President. Very much.

Discussions With Prime Minister Hashimoto

    Q. Mr. Prime Minister, the last time you met with Mr. Clinton, you 
gave him a saxophone. What are you going to do this time to make him 
happy? [Laughter]
    The President. And I played it, too.
    Prime Minister Hashimoto. What should I do about that? I think 
you're giving me more difficult questions than you're giving to the 
President. Well, it's a diplomatic secret. [Laughter]

Note: The exchange began at 1:58 p.m. at the Central Bank. A tape was 
not available for verification of the content of this exchange.
