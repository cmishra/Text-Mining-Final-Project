Statement on Congressional Action on Reporting and Disclosure 
Requirements for Political Action Committees
June 29, 2000

    The Vice President and I applaud the House and Senate for the broad, 
bipartisan approval of legislation to establish reporting and disclosure 
requirements for section 527 organizations, the so-called stealth PAC's. 
I commend the sponsors from both sides of the aisle and from both 
Chambers of Congress--including, Senators McCain,<McCain, 
John> Lieberman,<Lieberman, Joseph I.> and 
Feingold<Feingold, Russell D.> and Representatives 
Doggett,<Doggett, Lloyd> Moore,<Moore, Dennis> 
Castle,<Castle, Michael N.> and Houghton--for<Houghton, 
Amo> their leadership in addressing backdoor spending by these 
outside organizations.
    Passage of this bill proves that public interest can triumph over 
special interests, and I look forward to signing it as a first step 
toward meaningful campaign finance reform. There is still time this year 
to enact more comprehensive reform, and I renew my call to Congress for 
immediate action on the Shays-Meehan bill in the House and the McCain-
Feingold bill in the Senate to restore the public's faith in the 
integrity of our election system.
