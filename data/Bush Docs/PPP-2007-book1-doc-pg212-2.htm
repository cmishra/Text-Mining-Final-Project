March 2, 2007

March 1 Tornadoes in Alabama and Georgia

    Yesterday afternoon I spoke to Governor Riley<Riley, Bob<ls-thn-eq> 
of Alabama. This morning I spoke to Governor Perdue<Perdue, 
Sonny<ls-thn-eq> of Georgia, expressing my personal condolences as well 
as the condolences of the Nation for those who lost their lives in the 
recent tragedies in those two States.
    Tomorrow I'm going down to Georgia and Alabama. I go down with a 
heavy heart. I go down knowing full well that I'll be seeing people 
whose lives were turned upside down by the tornadoes. I'll do my very 
best to comfort them. I ask

our Nation, for those who are prayerful, to give a prayer for the 
victims of the storms, and ask for the blessings that can come upon 
people and the comfort necessary to deal with the recent tragedy. Thank 
you all very much.

House.
