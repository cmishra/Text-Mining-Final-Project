Message on the Observance of Juneteenth
June 15, 2005

    I send greetings to all Americans celebrating Juneteenth.
    Major General Gordon Granger led Union soldiers into Galveston, 
Texas, on June 19, 1865, bringing the news that the Civil War had ended 
and that the Emancipation Proclamation, signed over 2 years earlier, had 
declared all slaves to be free persons. This historic day is celebrated 
to remember the end of slavery. Emancipation demonstrated our country's 
belief in liberty and equality for every citizen, and was a profound 
recognition that each and every American has rights, dignity, and 
matchless value.
    One hundred forty years later, the Juneteenth observance continues 
to remind us of our country's founding principles of liberty and justice 
for all. As we mark the anniversary of the end of servitude, we also 
recognize the many contributions of African Americans to our culture. 
African Americans have helped shape our country's character, enhanced 
the diversity that makes America strong, and contributed to the 
vitality, success, and prosperity of our Nation. Juneteenth is a day 
that stands for the dignity and equality of all citizens, regardless of 
race, so that all may share the blessings of freedom that America 
provides.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes on this 
special occasion. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless 
America.

                                                          George W. Bush
