Statement on Signing the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Amendments Act 
of 1996
October 9, 1996

    Today I have signed into law H.R. 2594, the Railroad Unemployment 
Insurance Amendments Act of 1996, proving once again that when 
management and labor work together they make their businesses, their 
communities, and our working families stronger.
    This bill, which was supported by both labor and management, brings 
unemployment benefits for railroad workers in line with benefits for 
other workers. It also reduces the waiting periods for receiving 
unemployment and sickness benefits and increases the maximum daily rate 
for these same benefits.
    In short, this bill is good for the American economy and the 
American worker. I applaud rail labor and management and those at the 
Railroad Retirement Board, the Department of Labor, the Department of 
Transportation, the National Mediation Board, and all others who had a 
hand in helping to create the climate that has led to good relations and 
progress in the industry.

Note: H.R. 2594, approved October 9, was assigned Public Law No. 104-
251.
