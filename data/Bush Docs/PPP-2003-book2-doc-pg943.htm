Statement on the International Initiative To Help Developing Countries 
Stop Illegal Logging
July 28, 2003

    Today my administration has announced a new international initiative 
to help developing countries stop illegal logging. Illegal logging 
destroys biodiversity and hundreds of thousands of acres of forest 
habitat annually. It releases millions of tons of greenhouse gases into 
the atmosphere. Last year, I directed Secretary Powell<Powell, Colin 
L.<ls-thn-eq> to develop a plan to address this serious issue. I thank 
him for his efforts in establishing this initiative. Working with the 
private sector, nongovernmental organizations, and other nations, the 
United States will help identify and reduce threats to protected forest 
areas and other high-value conservation forests. These efforts will 
serve as a foundation for future actions to eliminate illegal logging, 
corruption in the forest sector, and the sale--including for export--of 
illegally harvested timber products. They will also help us protect 
forests and the livelihoods that depend upon them.
