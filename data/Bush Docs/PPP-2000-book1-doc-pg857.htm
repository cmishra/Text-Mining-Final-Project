Statement on Opposition to the Nomination of Enrique Moreno<Moreno, 
Enrique<ls-thn-eq>
May 6, 2000

    Senators Gramm<Gramm, Phil<ls-thn-eq> and Hutchison<Hutchison, Kay 
Bailey<ls-thn-eq> announced yesterday that they opposed the confirmation 
of Enrique Moreno, my nominee for a Texas vacancy on the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Their claim that he lacks the 
necessary experience to serve on the fifth circuit is unconscionable. 
The American Bar Association, which has rated judicial nominees for 
Republican and Democratic Presidents since the Eisenhower 
administration, unanimously gave Moreno their highest rating. The son of 
Mexican-American immigrants and a graduate of Harvard Law School, Moreno 
was rated one of the top three trial attorneys in El Paso by State 
judges.
    In rejecting Moreno's candidacy, the Texas<Gramm, Phil<ls-thn-eq> 
Senators<Hutchison, Kay Bailey<ls-thn-eq> have ignored the strong 
endorsement of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the 
Hispanic National Bar Association, and local law enforcement officials. 
This is not the first time that the Texas Senators have rejected an 
exceptional Hispanic candidate for this seat, which has been vacant for 
more than 3 years. Jorge Rangel<Rangel, Jorge<ls-thn-eq> was forced to 
withdraw after the Texas Senators refused to allow action on his 
nomination. By blocking qualified judicial

nominees, Gramm and Hutchison have exacerbated the vacancy crisis on the 
fifth circuit. Their unjustifiable opposition to Enrique Moreno--an 
exceptionally well-qualified Hispanic judicial nominee--must not be 
allowed to stand.
