Message to the Congress Transmitting Legislation To Limit the 
Availability of Certain Handgun Ammunition
June 30, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    Today I am transmitting for your immediate consideration and passage 
the ``Saving Law Enforcement Officers' Lives Act of 1995.'' This Act 
would limit the manufacture, importation, and distribution of handgun 
ammunition that serves little sporting purpose, but which kills law 
enforcement officers. The details of this proposal are described in the 
enclosed section-by-section analysis.
    Existing law already provides for limits on ammunition based on the 
specific materials from which it is made. It does not, however, address 
the problem of excessively powerful ammunition based on its performance.

    Criminals should not have access to handgun ammunition that will 
pierce the bullet-proof vests worn by law enforcement officers. That is 
the standard by which so-called ``cop-killer'' bullets are judged. My 
proposal would limit the availability of this ammunition.
    The process of designating such ammunition should be a careful one 
and should be undertaken in close consultation with all those who are 
affected, including representatives of law enforcement, sporting groups, 
the industries that manufacture bullet-proof vests and ammunition, and 
the academic research community. For that reason, the legislation 
requires the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the appropriate 
groups before regulations are promulgated. The legislation also provides 
for congressional review of the proposed regulations before they take 
effect.
    This legislation will save the lives of law enforcement officers 
without affecting the needs of legitimate sporting enthusiasts. I urge 
its prompt and favorable consideration by the Congress.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

June 30, 1995.
