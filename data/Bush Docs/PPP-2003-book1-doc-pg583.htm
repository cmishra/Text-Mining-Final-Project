    The loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia has underscored the historic

who have persevered despite tragedy and adversity. During this 
challenging time, our partnership has deepened and the International 
Space Station (ISS) program remains strong. The extraordinary efforts of 
our countries continue. The United States is committed to safely 
returning the Space Shuttle to flight, and the Russian Federation is 
committed to meeting the ISS crew transport and logistics resupply 
requirements necessary to

maintain our joint American astronaut and Russian cosmonaut teams on 
board the ISS until the Space Shuttle returns to flight.
    We confirm our mutual aspiration to ensure the continued assembly 
and viability of the International Space Station as a world-class 
research facility, relying on our unprecedented experience of bilateral 
and multilateral interaction in space. We reaffirm our commitment to the 
mission of human space flight and are prepared to take energetic steps 
to enhance our cooperation in the application of space technology and 
techniques.
