Statement on Congressional Completion of Appropriations Legislation
September 30, 1994

    I want to thank the House and Senate leadership, Senator Byrd and 
Congressman Obey, the chairmen of the Appropriations Committees, and 
their colleagues for their leadership and assistance. And I would be 
remiss if I didn't say how sorry I am that Congressman Natcher could not 
be with us to enjoy this achievement.
    We are making a start at putting our country's fiscal house in 
order. After years of partisan bickering, after years of rising 
deficits, it was time for Washington to get Federal spending under 
control. Our economic plan adopted by Congress last year gave us this 
start.
    Our 5 year deficit reduction plan put into place rigid controls on 
Government spending. It has produced 2 years of declining deficit for 
the first time in 20 years. We are reducing Federal employment by 
272,000 positions, placing us on a path to the smallest Federal 
Government since John Kennedy was President. We

are making a start on running Washington the way Americans run their 
households at home, within budget limits, paying the bills on time.
    For the first time since 1948, the Congress has adopted all 13 
Appropriations for signing by the President before the end of the fiscal 
year, all 13 bills, on time, within the rigid spending restraints 
required by our economic plan.
    The economic recovery gathering strength across our country is being 
built on this kind of progress. We have embarked on a journey to rebuild 
and renew the American economy. We haven't finished the job, but we are 
going to keep moving forward, keep cutting spending, and we're not going 
back.
