Message to the Congress Transmitting Proposed Legislation To Settle the 
Major League Baseball Labor Dispute
February 9, 1995

To the Congress of the United States:
    I am pleased to transmit for your immediate consideration and 
enactment the ``Major League Baseball Restoration Act.'' This 
legislation would provide for a fair and prompt settlement of the 
ongoing labor-management dispute affecting Major League Baseball.
    Major League Baseball has historically occupied a unique place in 
American life. The parties to the current contentious dispute have been 
unable to resolve their differences, despite many months of negotiations 
and the assistance of one of this country's most skilled mediators. If 
the dispute is permitted to continue, there is likely to be substantial 
economic damage to the cities and communities in which major league 
franchises are located and to the communities that host spring training. 
The ongoing dispute also threatens further serious harm to an important 
national institution.
    The bill I am transmitting today is a simple one. It would authorize 
the President to appoint a 3-member National Baseball Dispute Resolution 
Panel. This Panel of impartial and skilled arbitrators would be 
empowered to gather information from all sides and impose a binding 
agreement on the parties. The Panel would be urged to act as quickly as 
possible. Its decision would not be subject to judicial review.
    In arriving at a fair settlement, the Panel would consider a number 
of factors affecting the parties, but it could also take into account 
the effect on the public and the best interests of the game.
    The Panel would be given sufficient tools to do its job, without the 
need for further appropriations. Primary support for its activities 
would come from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, but 
other agencies would also be authorized to provide needed support.
    The dispute now affecting Major League Baseball has been a 
protracted one, and I believe that the time has come to take action. I 
urge the Congress to take prompt and favorable action on this 
legislation.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

February 8, 1995.
