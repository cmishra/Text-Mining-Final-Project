Statement on House Action on Foreign Affairs Legislation
June 8, 1995

    This bill (H.R. 1561) would take us in an isolationist direction at 
a time when America is ready to lead in the world. I am gratified that 
argument was persuasive to enough Members of the House to sustain a 
possible veto.
    We are particularly concerned about the vote to lift unilaterally 
the arms embargo in Bosnia. As we have said, we believe this is 
counterproductive to our efforts to bring about a negotiated settlement.
