Statement on the Tentative Agreement Between the International 
Association of Machinists and McDonnell Douglas
September 6, 1996

    I am pleased that the International Association of Machinists and 
McDonnell Douglas have reached a tentative agreement and congratulate 
both parties for working around the clock to settle their differences at 
the bargaining table. McDonnell Douglas workers are among the best 
defense workers in the world and I am hopeful that the 6,700 workers 
that have been on strike will be back at their jobs soon. I also commend 
Representative Gephardt for initiating this round of talks and for 
keeping both sides at the table.
    When labor and management work together to resolve their 
differences, the company and the workers benefit. In this case, all 
Americans will benefit from having an experienced workforce back at 
their jobs, filling critical aerospace orders for our military.
