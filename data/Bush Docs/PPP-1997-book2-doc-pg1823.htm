Statement on Deferred Enforced Departure for Haitians
December 23, 1997

    Today I have directed the Attorney General and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to defer for one year the deportation of Haitians 
who were paroled into the United States or applied for asylum prior to 
December 31, 1995. This action implements the commitment I made to 
address the situation of Haitians when I signed immigration legislation 
last month offering relief to Central Americans and others. It will 
shield these Haitians from deportation while we work with Congress to 
provide them long-term legislative relief.
    Haitians deserve the same treatment we sought for Central Americans. 
Like Central Americans, Haitians for many years were forced to seek the 
protection of the United States because of oppression, human rights 
abuses, and civil strife at home. Many of them have established strong 
ties and made significant contributions to our communities. And while we 
have been encouraged by Haiti's progress following the restoration of 
democratic government in 1994, the situation there remains fragile. 
Staying the deportation of these Haitians and obtaining for them 
permanent legislative relief will help support a stable and democratic 
Haiti--which, in turn, is the best safeguard against a renewed flow of 
Haitian migrants to the United States.
