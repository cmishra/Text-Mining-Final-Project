Statement on the Death of Representative Frank Tejeda
January 31, 1997

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn today of the death of 
Congressman Frank Tejeda. Congressman Tejeda spent the last years of his 
life not only fighting for the citizens of San Antonio but also 
courageously battling cancer. Frank was a friend who dedicated himself 
to serving his country and community. He will long be remembered for his 
perseverance in the face of adversity. He endeared himself to all who 
knew him, always looking out for the best interests of his constituents, 
members of the military, and the Hispanic and veterans' communities in 
particular. We will miss him greatly. Our thoughts and prayers are with 
his children, Marissa, Sonya, and Frank, his mother, Lillie, his 
extended family members, and his many friends at this difficult time.
