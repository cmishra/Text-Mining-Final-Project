Remarks in a Discussion on the Partnership With BusinessLINC
August 10, 1999

    The President. Well, hello, everyone. I have a few remarks, but I 
want to be brief so we can get on to the business at hand. But first, 
I'd like to thank James Powell<Powell, James> for making us 
feel welcome in his place of business, and his family and his co-workers 
and the instruction that he gave me on making a mop. I'm always looking 
for new skills since I have to acquire some pretty soon. [Laughter] And 
the Vice President<Gore, Albert, Jr.> appreciates the fact 
that he<Powell, James> buys the cord from Tennessee.
    The Vice President.<Gore, Albert, Jr.> Humboldt, 
Tennessee.
    The President. And I want to thank the mayor<Williams, Anthony 
A.> and the two <Chavous, 
Kevin>councilpersons<Jarvis, Charlene Drew> and 
Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton<Norton, Eleanor Holmes> 
for making us feel welcome up here. We're always glad to be out in DC, 
but this is a special opportunity. And I know that the mayor and 
Councilwoman Charlene Drew Jarvis and Kevin Chavous--Councilman Chavous 
are excited about what's going on here.
    I want to thank Dana Mead;<Mead, Dana G.> the president 
and CEO of Tenneco; the gentleman to my right who is the chair of the 
Business Roundtable; and Peter Bijur,<Bijur, Peter I.> the 
president and CEO of Texaco, who is going to chair our BusinessLINC 
national coalition, for their willingness to undertake this project with 
gusto; and all the others around here who are proving that this kind of 
thing works and who will be introduced as we go through, including the 
members of the administration who are here: Secretary Summers;<Summers, 
Lawrence H.> Gene Sperling,<Sperling, Gene> my 
National Economic Counselor, who has done so much to develop the new 
markets initiative; Aida Alvarez<Alvarez, Aida> of the SBA; 
and Jack Lew,<Lew, Jacob J.> Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget.

    We all know why we're here. We have a record expansion in America, 
the longest peacetime expansion in history. It has finally, in the last 
3 years, given us substantial increases in wages for ordinary workers, 
after 20 years of stagnation, and the lowest minority unemployment rate 
ever recorded. Yet we know that there are still people in places that 
have not been touched by this recovery.
    And it's very interesting to me that what many of us in the business 
community, as well as in the public sector, believe is a moral 
obligation we have to try to give all our people a chance to participate 
in this great economy is also an economic opportunity and perhaps an 
economic imperative. Every day, I promise you, the people here who run 
these big companies have got people scouring the press every day trying 
to divine the intention of the markets: Have we reached the limits of 
this expansion? Can we continue to grow the economy without inflation? 
How can we do it?
    Well, obviously, if we expand economic opportunity and create 
businesses, employees, and consumers in areas where they didn't exist 
before, that is an inflation-free way to expand the economy. So we have 
reached a point in our country's economic development where I think we 
finally have a chance to do something for the places that have been left 
behind, from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to the Native American 
reservations to the inner-city neighborhoods, in ways that will benefit 
all Americans. That's the idea behind the new markets initiative and the 
tour I took of areas that have been left behind, a few weeks ago with a 
lot of CEO's and other people.
    And the idea is simple, that we want a partnership between business 
and Government to make investments more attractive in areas where they 
haven't been made in the past but only on the basis of profit, that this 
has to be a profitable decision. This is not a social program. This is 
free enterprise economics. We are trying to create the conditions in 
which the economic expansion, which has so benefited so many millions of 
Americans, can reach people who have been left behind for decades.
    Mr. Powell's<Powell, James> exhibit A. He introduced me to 
someone who moved from welfare to work in his company. He introduced me 
to a man who has eight children that he feels he can now support. He 
introduced me to a man who immigrated to this country 10 years ago from 
Central America, who's proud to be working here.
    And this is a very, very important moment for our country, because 
for at least 30 years, Americans have wanted to do this, not just 
politicians; people in business have wished there was some way to bring 
free enterprise to the people and the places that have been left behind. 
And we believe we have found some ways to do it.
    Now, I said, we have to do this in partnership. And just this last 
week, legislation based on our new markets initiative was introduced in 
both the House and Senate. It's pretty simple. It's basically designed 
to give American investors like those around this table, the same 
incentive to invest in developing markets in America that we give you to 
invest in developing markets in Central America or the Caribbean or Asia 
or Africa. I support those incentives for those countries, but they 
ought to exist in this country as well.
    It builds on the successful approach that the Vice President and I 
have developed over the last 6\1/2\ years, and that he<Powell, 
James> has so very ably headed, of our empowerment zones, our 
enterprise communities, a stronger Community Reinvestment Act, community 
financial institutions. This approach is working where we have applied 
it. What we want is a nationwide framework.
    What we're here today to talk about is what I think is perhaps the 
single most important thing the business community can do to make this 
work: BusinessLINC. Let me tell you how BusinessLINC got started.
    Nearly 2 years ago, Vice President Gore<Gore, Albert, Jr.> 
met Tom Lazo<Lazo, Tom> down there in Dallas, in south Dallas. 
He had a small company that built telecommunications equipment. It was 
doing well, but he told the Vice President that his company couldn't 
grow and thrive without technical assistance and better training, 
without tools and skills his larger competitors already had. He needed a 
corporate mentor. That's why we launched BusinessLINC last summer, under 
the leadership of the Vice President<Gore, Albert, Jr.> and 
with the support of Secretary Summers,<Summers, Lawrence H.> 
Administrator Alvarez,<Alvarez, Aida> and former Secretary 
Rubin.<Rubin, Robert E.>
    Tom Lazo's<Lazo, Tom> idea has a lot of power: large 
companies helping small companies get access to capital, learn the best 
technology and the best management techniques. As many of you can attest 
and will attest this morning, partnerships like this are good for 
investment, good

for consumers, good for the bottom line. You see that at businesses like 
Powell's. And Mr. Powell<Powell, James> and his big supporter 
will have a chance to talk here in just a moment.
    Today I am very pleased that the Business Roundtable, a coalition of 
Fortune 500 companies, is stepping up to lead BusinessLINC. This means 
that we'll be able to go national with this idea. This means we'll be 
able to do it in a big way. And this means people who know what they're 
doing will have a stake and a commitment to its success. I cannot thank 
Dana<Mead, Dana G.> enough. I cannot thank Peter<Bijur, Peter 
I.> enough. This is a very, very impressive commitment, and 
I'm very grateful to both of you.
    Especially, I want to thank Texaco's Peter Bijur,<Bijur, Peter 
I.> because since he's going to lead the effort, Dana<Mead, 
Dana G.> can look at him and ask for results. [Laughter] I've 
been on both ends of that; I'd rather be asking than answering. 
[Laughter] But this will help the corporate community to meet the 
challenge the Vice President<Gore, Albert, Jr.> issued a year 
ago to mentor more businesses, especially in the distressed communities.
    Now, I know the Vice President<Gore, Albert, Jr.> has more 
to say about BusinessLINC, so I'd like to ask him to say a few things, 
and then we'll just start calling on the people around the table. And I 
think the press and those who read about this or see about it on the 
media will quickly understand the great power of this idea.
    Mr. Vice President.

[At this point, Vice President Gore<Gore, Albert, Jr.> made 
brief remarks, and the roundtable discussion began.]

    The President. I just want to make one very brief point here, 
because the last two presentations illustrate something that we really 
believe and that basically is the whole reason for the existence of the 
Small Business Administration, which is that, even in the best of times 
there are almost artificial barriers to the success of free markets. We 
are not trying to supplant them; we're trying to take away the barriers 
to them. That's what you're doing, and in so doing you're creating more. 
And this is very impressive to me.

[The discussion continued.]

    The President. I think this has been wonderful. And let me say we 
are--I think we have a reasonably good chance to get a bipartisan big 
vote for the legislation that would provide some greater tax incentives 
and some eligibility for lower interest loans to go with the equity in 
some of these really distressed areas this year. But none of this is 
going to happen without the kind of partnerships that we've celebrated 
today. This is clearly something that is better done and can only be 
done, really, in the private sector with the Government sort of cheering 
on and then trying to provide the resources that SBA and others have.
    So, again I want to thank Dana<Mead, Dana G.> and 
Peter<Bijur, Peter I.> and all the rest of you, and those of 
you who are living and doing this every day, and I just can't thank you 
enough. I also would like to say that it means a lot to me personally, 
having been a resident of Washington, DC, the last 6\1/2\ years, that we 
could do this in Washington, highlight this project, and remind people 
that there is another Washington where not everybody does have a good 
job or a good opportunity, and that we believe our Nation's Capital is 
small enough that the economies of scale work in a way that with 
sustained vigorous leadership, we can actually bring economic 
opportunity to all the neighborhoods here.
    So, Mr. Mayor<Williams, Anthony A.> and 
Congresswoman,<Norton, Eleanor Holmes> and to all the rest of 
you, I want to thank you. And if you'd like to say anything in closing, 
we'd be glad to hear from you.

Note: The discussion began at 12:45 p.m. in the workroom at Powell's 
Manufacturing Industries, Inc. In his remarks, the President referred to 
James Powell, president, Powell's Manufacturing Industries, Inc.; Mayor 
Anthony A. Williams of Washington, DC; and Tom Lazo, president and chief 
executive officer, Custom Programming Services, Inc. The transcript 
released by the Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks 
of Vice President Al Gore.
