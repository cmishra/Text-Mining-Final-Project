Nomination for Ambassador to Norway
August 27, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate Thomas A. 
Loftus to be the U.S. Ambassador to Norway. Mr. Loftus is the director 
of WisKids Count and served in the Wisconsin State Legislature for 14 
years, including 8 years as its speaker.
    ``I am pleased today to announce my intention to nominate Tom Loftus 
as the Ambassador to Norway,'' said the President. ``Tom will bring to 
this position the same energy and commitment to public service that 
characterized his leadership in the Wisconsin Assembly. He will 
strengthen our already strong ties with the Government of Norway and 
will serve this Nation with pride.''

Press Secretary.
