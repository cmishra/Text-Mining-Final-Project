Videotaped Remarks to Tracey Brown<Brown, Tracey<ls-thn-eq> From Cape 
Town, South Africa
March 27, 1998

    Tracey, I wish you could have been with us when we heard President 
Rawlings<Rawlings, Jerry John<ls-thn-eq> in Ghana, President 
Museveni<Museveni, Yoweri Kaguta<ls-thn-eq> in Uganda, talking about 
your father and how much he did for Africa and how much he did to bring 
America and Africa in closer contact. And of course, on Saturday in 
Johannesburg, we dedicated the Ron Brown Commercial Center--your 
mom<Brown, Alma<ls-thn-eq> was there--to your dad's memory. His legacy 
will live on here because the center will promote economic progress and 
individual empowerment and democracy.
    Let me say that I've actually read your book from start to finish, 
and I loved it. And your daddy would be proud of it. And it's just sort 
of sassy and braggy enough to be right where he was. [Laughter] So I 
hope you sell a zillion copies. You certainly deserve it, and I'm very, 
very proud of you.

Note: These remarks were videotaped at approximately 5:05 p.m. in the 
library at the Cape Grace Hotel, to congratulate Ms. Brown on the 
publication of her biography of her father, ``The Life and

Times of Ron Brown.'' In his remarks, the President referred to Ms. 
Brown's mother, Alma Brown. The transcript released by the Office of the 
Press Secretary also included the opening remarks of the First Lady.
