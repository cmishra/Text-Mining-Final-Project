Statement on Foreign Operations Appropriations Legislation
November 5, 1999

    I am pleased that we have reached an agreement with congressional 
leaders on a budget that will permit America to advance its most 
critical priorities around the world. This agreement meets our 
commitments to the Middle East peace process, funds our efforts to 
safeguard nuclear weapons and expertise in the former Soviet Union, 
makes an initial investment in debt relief for impoverished countries, 
including in Africa and Latin America, and allows us to do our part in 
bringing stability and democracy to southeast Europe. I hope this marks 
the start of a bipartisan effort to ensure that America has not only the 
will but the resources to lead.
