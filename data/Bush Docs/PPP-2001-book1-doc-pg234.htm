Message to the Congress on Continuation of the National Emergency With 
Respect to Iran
March 13, 2001

To the Congress of the United States:
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to 
Iran is to continue in effect beyond March 15, 2001, to the Federal 
Register for publication. The most recent notice continuing this 
emergency was published in the Federal Register on March 14, 2000.
    The crisis constituted by the actions and policies of the Government 
of Iran, including its support for international terrorism, efforts to 
undermine Middle East peace, and acquisition of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means to deliver them, that led to the declaration 
of a national emergency on March 15, 1995, has not been resolved. These 
actions and policies are contrary to the interests of the United States 
in the region and threaten vital interests of the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I 
have determined that I must continue the declaration of national 
emergency with respect to Iran necessary to maintain comprehensive 
sanctions against Iran to respond to this threat.

                                                          George W. Bush

 The White House,

 March 13, 2001.

Note: The notice of March 13 is listed in Appendix D at the end of this 
volume.
