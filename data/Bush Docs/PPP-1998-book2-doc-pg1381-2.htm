Statement on Congressional Action on Job Training Reform Legislation
July 31, 1998

    I am pleased that both Houses of Congress have now passed a 
comprehensive bill to give Americans new opportunities and choices to 
train for the jobs of the future. This bill will modernize job training 
to fit the needs of today's economy, and I appreciate the bipartisan 
spirit that prevailed in getting that done. Modeled on my ``GI bill'' 
for America's workers, this new

training bill streamlines the vast array of existing job programs and 
empowers individuals to learn new skills with a simple grant. It makes 
sure that job training helps Americans meet the demand of a rapidly 
changing economy, and I look forward to signing it into law.
