Remarks at a Saint Patrick's Day Shamrock Presentation Ceremony With 
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern<Ahern, Bertie> of Ireland
March 13, 2003

    Thank you very much, Taoiseach, and welcome back to the White House. 
Laura<Bush, Laura> and I are honored you came and really glad 
you're here.
    On behalf of the American people, I thank you for the bowl of 
shamrocks and the good fortune they promise. This annual gift symbolizes 
the deep and enduring friendship between our two countries. The strong 
ties between Ireland and the United States reach back centuries.
    These strong ties have been affirmed at critical moments in our 
country's history. It is said that during the Revolutionary War, an 
Irish American woman, Lydia Darragh, provided valuable intelligence to 
George Washington's troops, helping prevent a planned British offensive. 
During the Civil War, the famed Irish Brigade fought valiantly on the 
Union side in terrible battles, some not far from where we stand.
    And throughout America's history, we have benefited from the 
industry and the talents and the ideals of millions of Ireland's sons 
and daughters. Today, our two countries share a deep commitment to 
building a world of peace and security and prosperity and freedom. We've 
stood together in Afghanistan, in Kosovo, in Bosnia, and beyond, to stop 
aggression and to alleviate suffering. Ireland is a valued member of the 
coalition against global terror. And we thank you, sir.
    The American people appreciate Ireland's work on U.N. Security 
Council to help secure passage of the Resolution 1441. That resolution 
demanded that Iraq disarm itself of all weapons of mass destruction. We 
appreciate Ireland's support for ensuring that the just demands of the 
world are enforced. The responsibilities of freedom are not always easy 
to bear, but Ireland and America are joined by a common commitment to 
freedom's defense against tyranny and terror.
    Our two countries also stand together in another cause, working to 
achieve lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Recent years have seen 
historic progress thanks to the tireless efforts of Prime Minister Ahern 
and Blair<Blair, Tony> and many other people who long for 
peace. Now all parties can and must build on this progress so that the 
people of Northern Ireland can replace old resentments with new 
cooperation and new hope. America has long supported this vital work, 
and today that support endures and continues. We will help where we can.
    Saint Patrick's Day reminds us of the close ties of family and 
friendship between our countries, but everyday--every day of the year, 
America is proud to call Ireland a friend.

    Taoiseach, may good fortune be yours, may your joys never end, may 
good luck be with you wherever you go, and your blessings outnumber the 
shamrocks that grow. Welcome.

Note: The President spoke at 9:38 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Bertie Ahern 
of Ireland, who presented the shamrocks; and Prime Minister Tony Blair 
of the United Kingdom.
