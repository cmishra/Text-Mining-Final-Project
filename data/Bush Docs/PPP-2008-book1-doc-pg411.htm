Remarks at the White House Easter Egg Roll
March 24, 2008

    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I welcome you to the White House 
for the Easter egg roll. How about the<Jonas, Joseph<ls-thn-eq> 
Jonas<Jonas, Kevin<ls-thn-eq> Brothers?<Jonas, Nicholas<ls-thn-eq> 
Thanks for coming. We are sure glad you're here. We welcome you to the 
Easter egg roll.
    Pretty soon, after a few remarks, I have the honor of blowing the 
whistle to start the Easter egg roll. But we've got a lot of other 
people who are going to make sure today is a special day. We want to 
thank all our volunteers who have made this event possible. We thank 
our--[applause]--yes, there you are. [Laughter] We thank our readers. 
For you Dallas Cowboy fans, it is a great honor to welcome Troy 
Aikman<Aikman, Troy<ls-thn-eq> here to be one of the readers.
    We want to remind you that we're dedicating today's Easter egg roll 
to our clean oceans. And there's a booth here where you can find out how 
you can contribute to make sure that we're environmentally sound 
stewards of our oceans. Ocean conservation is a important aspect of good 
public service, and it's certainly something that Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> has on her mind, as she comes up to address you. And so 
now it's my honor to welcome the First Lady of the United States, my 
dear wife, Laura Bush.

Note: The President spoke at 9:23 a.m. from the Blue Room balcony at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to entertainers the Jonas 
Brothers; and Troy Aikman, former quarterback, National Football 
League's Dallas Cowboys. The transcript released by the Office of the 
Press Secretary also included the remarks of the First Lady.
