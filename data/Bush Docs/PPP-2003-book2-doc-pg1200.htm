Message on the Observance of Rosh Hashanah, 5764
September 26, 2003

    I send greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah.
    For the Jewish community in the United States and around the world, 
this holiday marks the beginning of the New Year and the onset of the 
Days of Awe. Rosh Hashanah is a time to seek the mercy and forgiveness 
of the Almighty and your fellow man, to reflect on past actions, and to 
demonstrate renewed commitment to faith and family. May you find 
inspiration for the days ahead as you remember the devotion of Abraham 
and Isaac and their willingness to sacrifice everything to do right.
    During this holy time, I encourage you to pray for peace and mutual 
understanding throughout the world. May we build a future of promise and 
compassion for all, and may the coming year be filled with hope and 
happiness.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a blessed Rosh Hashanah.

                                                          George W. Bush
