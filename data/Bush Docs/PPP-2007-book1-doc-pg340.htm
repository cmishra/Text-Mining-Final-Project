Remarks on House of Representatives Passage of Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations
March 23, 2007

    Today I'm joined here at the White House by veterans, family members 
of people serving in combat, family members of those who have 
sacrificed. I am honored that they have joined me here today.
    Here in Washington, members of both parties recognize that our most 
solemn responsibility is to support our troops in the war on terror. Yet 
today a narrow majority in the House of Representatives abdicated its 
responsibility by passing a war spending bill that has no chance of 
becoming law and brings us no closer to getting our troops the resources 
they need to do their job.
    The purpose of the emergency war spending bill I requested was to 
provide our troops with vital funding. Instead, Democrats in the House, 
in an act of political theater, voted to substitute their judgment for 
that of our military commanders on the ground in Iraq. They set rigid 
restrictions that will require an army of lawyers to interpret. They set 
an arbitrary date for withdrawal without regard for conditions on the 
ground. And they tacked on billions for pet projects that have nothing 
to do with winning the war on terror. This bill has too much pork, too 
many conditions, and an artificial timetable for withdrawal.
    As I have made clear for weeks, I will veto it if it comes to my 
desk. And because the vote in the House was so close, it is

clear that my veto would be sustained. Today's action in the House does 
only one thing: It delays the delivery of vital resources for our 
troops. A narrow majority has decided to take this course, just as 
General Petraeus<Petraeus, David H.<ls-thn-eq> and his troops are 
carrying out a new strategy to help the Iraqis secure their capital 
city.
    Amid the real challenges in Iraq, we're beginning to see some signs 
of progress. Yet, to score political points, the Democratic majority in 
the House has shown it is willing to undermine the gains our troops are 
making on the ground.
    Democrats want to make clear that they oppose the war in Iraq. They 
have made their point. For some, that is not enough. These Democrats 
believe that the longer they can delay funding for our troops, the more 
likely they are to force me to accept restrictions on our commanders, an 
artificial timetable for withdrawal, and their pet spending projects. 
This is not going to happen. Our men and women in uniform need these 
emergency war funds. The Secretary of Defense<Gates, Robert 
M.<ls-thn-eq> has warned that if Congress does not approve the emergency 
funding for our troops by April the 15th, our men and women in uniform 
will face significant disruptions, and so would their families.
    The Democrats have sent their message; now it's time to send their 
money. This is an important moment--a decision for the new leaders in 
Congress. Our men and women in uniform should not have to worry that 
politicians in Washington will deny them the funds and the flexibility 
they need to win. Congress needs to send me a clean bill that I can sign 
without delay. I expect Congress to do its duty and to fund our troops, 
and so do the American people, and so do the good men and women standing 
with me here today.
    Thank you for your time.

Note: The President spoke at 2 p.m. in the Diplomatic Reception Room at 
the White House. In his remarks, he referred to Gen. David H. Petraeus, 
USA, commanding general, Multi-National Force--Iraq; and Secretary of 
Defense Robert M. Gates. He also referred to H.R. 1591.
