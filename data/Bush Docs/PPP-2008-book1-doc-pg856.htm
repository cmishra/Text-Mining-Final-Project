    I send greetings to those celebrating Juneteenth.

Granger in

Galveston, Texas, and his declaration that slavery had been abolished 
and the blessings of liberty were finally extended to African Americans.

    On this occasion, we recognize the many contributions that African 
Americans have made to our great Nation and honor the legacy of 
diversity that America has embraced. Today is an opportunity to recommit 
ourselves to confronting injustice wherever we find it and upholding the 
dignity of all people. By doing so, we protect the freedom and 
democratic ideals that will keep America strong for generations to come.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes on this 
memorable occasion.

                                                          George W. Bush
