Statement on the V-22 Aircraft Tragedy
April 9, 2000

    On Saturday, April 8, the United States lost brave members of the 
Marine Corps, who died in the line of duty in the service of their 
country. They sacrificed their lives in a training accident involving a 
V-22 aircraft in Arizona. This terrible loss of life is a reminder of 
how so many men and women in the Nation's military put their lives at 
risk each and every day, so that we might be a free people and the cause 
of peace can be advanced throughout the world.
    Hillary and I offer our prayers for those we have so suddenly lost 
and for their family and friends, whose burden of grief is so great. We 
pray that God may bless them all. Though their names and faces were not 
known to most of America before this tragic moment, I know that the 
American people will recognize in their names and faces in the days 
ahead the genuine quality of heroism.
