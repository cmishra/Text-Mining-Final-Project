Statement on House Action on Proposed Legislation To Provide Assistance 
to African Nations
July 16, 1999

    I welcome and applaud passage today by the House of Representatives 
of the African growth and opportunity act. This historic initiative will 
set the foundation for a stronger partnership between the United States 
and Africa. I urge the Senate to act quickly so that we can strengthen 
the ties between our Nation and a continent on the verge of a new era of 
democracy and prosperity.
    This legislation offers the opportunity for increased trade and 
investment between the United States and Africa to the mutual benefit of 
both. By working with African nations to build their economies, 
strengthen democratic government, and increase opportunities for all the 
people of Africa, we will help build strong, capable partners with whom 
we can work to counter the growing threats of terrorism, crime, 
environmental degradation, and disease.
