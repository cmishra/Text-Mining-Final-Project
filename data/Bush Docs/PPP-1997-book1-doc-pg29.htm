Message on the Observance of Ramadan
January 10, 1997

    Warm greetings to all those celebrating the sacred month of Ramadan.
    Each year during Ramadan, Muslims across America and around the 
world commemorate God's revelation of the Koran to Muhammad with a month 
of rigorous fasting and devout prayer. This period of discipline for 
body, mind, and spirit draws the Muslim community closer not only to 
God, but also to their fellow human beings.
    By experiencing hunger during Ramadan, the followers of Muhammad 
learn true compassion for the poor of the world who go hungry every day. 
By reflecting on God's teachings in the Koran, they learn humility and 
the beauty of forgiveness. And, by their example of devotion and self-
discipline during Ramadan, Muslims remind us all that our true strength 
is derived, not from food and drink, but from closeness to God.
    As the crescent moon marks the beginning of Ramadan again this year, 
Hillary and I extend our best wishes for a holy and memorable 
observance.

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This message was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on
