Statement on the United Nations/NATO Decision To Launch Airstrikes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina
May 25, 1995

    I welcome the decision of the U.N. and NATO to launch airstrikes 
today against a Bosnian-Serb ammunition site following the violence of 
the past several days in and around Sarajevo. This action was taken in 
response to Bosnian-Serb defiance of yesterday's UNPROFOR demand for the 
return of heavy weapons to designated weapons collection points in 
accord with existing agreements.
    This action should help NATO and the U.N. sustain their ability to 
ease suffering in the region. I hope that today's airstrikes will 
convince the Bosnian-Serb leadership to end their violations of the 
exclusion zone and comply with their other agreements with the U.N.
    I appreciate the courage and dedication of the U.N. forces on the 
ground in the former Yugoslavia and trust that this evidence of U.N. and 
NATO determination will serve to enhance the ability of these forces to 
remain and perform their missions.
