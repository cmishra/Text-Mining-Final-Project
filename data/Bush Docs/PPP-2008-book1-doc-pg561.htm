Statement on Farm Legislation
April 22, 2008

    I am disappointed that Congress has failed to put forward a good 
farm bill, leaving farmers and ranchers in a state of continued 
uncertainty as to how they will be affected by Federal policies.
    The farm bill proposal currently being discussed by conferees would 
fail several important tests that I have set forth. With record farm 
income, now is not the timefor Congress to ask other sectors of the 
economy to pay higher taxes in order to increase the size of Government. 
The proposal would increase spending by at least $16 billion, masked in 
part by budgetary gimmicks and funded in part by additional tax 
revenues. These tax revenue provisions are unacceptable, including tax 
compliance initiatives being considered by the House

and Senate conference committee. As important, the proposal also lacks 
the important reforms I've repeatedly called for.
    After last week's short-term extension of the farm bill, Congress 
now has only 4 days to provide certainty to America's farmers and 
ranchers. Despite the passage of more than a year since my 
administration unveiled a responsible and forward-looking farm bill 
proposal, there are no signs that the conference committee will reach 
agreement on an acceptable farm bill by Friday. I therefore call on 
Congress to provide our agricultural producers with the certainty to 
make sound business and planting decisions about this year's crop by 
extending current law for at least 1 year.
