Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting the Blueprint for the New 
Freedom Initiative
February 1, 2001

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Enclosed please find the blueprint for my ``New Freedom Initiative'' 
to increase investment in and access to assistive technologies and a 
quality education, and help integrate Americans with disabilities into 
the workforce and into community life. I look forward to working with 
the Congress to ensure that these proposals are enacted into law and to 
working together to ensure that every American with a disability has 
access to the American dream.
        Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: Letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, and Richard B. Cheney, President of the Senate. An 
original was not available for verification of the content of this
