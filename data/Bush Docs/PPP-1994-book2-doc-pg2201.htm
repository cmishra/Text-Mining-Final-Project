Statement on the Observance of Kwanzaa
December 23, 1994

    Warm greetings to everyone who is observing the festival of Kwanzaa.
    A vibrant and energizing celebration, Kwanzaa offers millions an 
opportunity to embrace the rich cultural traditions of the African 
heritage. The seven principles of Kwanzaa, unity, self-determination, 
collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, 
creativity, and faith, serve as vital tools in building hope and 
opportunity in our communities and throughout our country, and I am 
pleased that so many of my fellow Americans are celebrating this year. 
All of you can be proud of your efforts to infuse the holiday season 
with diversity and new purpose.
    Hillary joins me in wishing all of you a wonderful celebration and a 
Happy New Year.

Note: An identical message on the observance of Kwanzaa, December 26-
January 1, was also made available by the White House.
