Statement on the Attorney General's Decision Not To Call for an 
Independent Counsel
December 2, 1997

    The Attorney General made her decision based on a careful review of 
the law and the facts, and that's as it should be.

Note: On December 2, following preliminary investigations begun in 
September and October by a Justice Department task force, Attorney 
General Janet Reno announced her decision that allegations against the 
President and the Vice President concerning fundraising telephone calls 
made from the White House did not at that time warrant the appointment 
of an independent counsel.
