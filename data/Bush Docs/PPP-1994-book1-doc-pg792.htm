Statement on the Presidential Awards for Design Excellence
April 28, 1994

    Quality design is essential if we are to compete effectively in the 
world marketplace, create more jobs, make our cities more livable, 
protect our environment, and enrich our cultural life.
    The Nation is indebted to the designers and the Federal Government 
partners responsible for these exemplary projects. As we strive for 
first-rate quality for every tax dollar spent, theirs is an example of 
excellence we want others to emulate.

Note: This statement was included in a White House statement announcing 
the recipients of the Presidential Awards for Design Excellence.
