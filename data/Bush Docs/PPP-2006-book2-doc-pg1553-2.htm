Letter to Congressional Leaders Transmitting a Notice of Intention To 
Enter Into a Free Trade Agreement With Colombia
August 24, 2006

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Consistent with section 2105(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 2002, 
(Public Law 107-210) (the ``Trade Act''), I am pleased to notify the 
Congress of my intention to enter into a free trade agreement with the 
Republic of Colombia.
    The United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement will generate 
export opportunities for U.S. farmers, ranchers, and companies, help 
create jobs in the United States, and help American consumers save money 
while offering them more choices.
The Agreement will also benefit the people of Colombia by providing 
economic opportunity and by strengthening democracy.
    Consistent with the Trade Act, I am sending this notification at 
least 90 days in advance of signing the Agreement. My Administration 
looks forward to working with the Congress in developing appropriate 
legislation to approve and implement this Agreement.
         Sincerely,

                                                          George W. Bush
