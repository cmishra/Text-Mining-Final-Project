Statement on the Resignation of Governor James S. Gilmore III<Gilmore, 
James S., III> of Virginia as Republican National Committee 
Chairman
November 30, 2001

    Jim Gilmore is a close friend and valuable ally. He answered my call 
to lead the Republican Party through a challenging and dynamic election. 
He has done so with fervor and conviction. He has advanced our 
principles of limited but active government and promoted compassionate 
priorities that strengthen American families, keep Americans safe, and 
encourage individual responsibility.
    There are few who embody public service the way that Jim Gilmore 
does, serving as Governor of Virginia, chairman of a national commission 
on terrorism, and leader of the national Republican Party all in the 
same year.
    There is no greater priority on this Earth than one's family, and I 
respect and understand the decision Governor Gilmore has made. I wish 
him the best of luck in all his future endeavors and will continue to 
seek his wise counsel as a friend and confidante.
