Nomination for Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
February 12, 1993

    The President today announced his intention to nominate James Lee 
Witt, the head of Arkansas' State Office of Emergency Management and a 
former county judge, as Director of the Nation's Federal Emergency 
Management Agency.
    ``The devastation wrought by Hurricane Andrew last year was a sober 
reminder that we need to provide strong, organized, and effective help 
to American families whose lives are dramatically affected by 
disaster,'' President Clinton said. ``James Lee has done an outstanding 
job in Arkansas, and I am confident he will do the same for the country 
in his new role.''

Note: A biography of the nominee was made available by the Office of the 
Press Secretary.
