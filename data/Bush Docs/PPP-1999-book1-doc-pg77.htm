Letter to Congressional Leaders on Continuation of the National 
Emergency Regarding Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East 
Peace Process
January 20, 1999

Dear Mr. Speaker:  (Dear Mr. President:)
    Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President 
publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice 
stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the 
anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the 
enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to 
grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists that disrupt the 
Middle East peace process is to continue in effect beyond January 23, 
1999, to the Federal Register for publication. The most recent notice 
continuing this emergency was published in the Federal Register on 
January 22, 1998.
    The crisis with respect to the grave acts of violence committed by 
foreign terrorists that threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace 
process that led to the declaration on January 23, 1995, of a national 
emergency has not been resolved. Terrorist groups continue to engage in 
activities with the purpose or effect of threatening the Middle East 
peace process, and which are hostile to United States interests in the 
region.
    Such actions threaten vital interests of the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States. On August 20, 1998, I 
identified four additional persons, including Usama bin Ladin,<bin 
Ladin, Usama> that threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace 
process. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to 
maintain in force the broad authorities necessary to deny any financial 
support from the United States for foreign terrorists that threaten to 
disrupt the Middle East peace process.
        Sincerely,

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: Identical letters were sent to J. Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives, and Albert Gore, Jr., President of the Senate. 
The notice is listed in Appendix D at the end of this volume.
