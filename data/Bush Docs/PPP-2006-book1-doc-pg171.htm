Statement on the New Freedom Initiative
February 1, 2006

    Five years ago, I announced the New Freedom Initiative to build on 
the progress of the Americans with Disabilities Act and more fully 
integrate people with disabilities into all aspects of life. Since the 
announcement of this important initiative, we have expanded educational 
opportunities for children with disabilities and provided essential 
funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. We have 
launched disabilityinfo.gov to serve as an online resource for people 
with disabilities and their families, employers, service providers, and 
other community members. To provide expanded employment opportunities, 
we are assisting persons with disabilities by implementing the Ticket to 
Work program and strengthening training and employment services at One-
Stop Career Centers.
    As a result of these efforts, Americans with disabilities have 
greater access to the opportunities of America. My administration will 
continue to work to remove barriers that still confront Americans with 
disabilities and their families.
