Statement on Terrorist Attacks in Istanbul, Turkey
November 15, 2003

    I condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attacks 
today in Istanbul, where Turkey's diverse religious communities of 
Muslim, Jewish, and Christian believers have flourished together for 
centuries. The focus of these attacks on Turkey's Jewish community, in 
Istanbul's synagogues where men, women, and children gathered to worship 
God, remind us that our enemy in the war against terror is without 
conscience or faith. Turkey has suffered terrible losses from terrorism 
for decades, and the United States stands resolutely with Turkey in the 
global war on terrorism. On behalf of the American people, I express our 
condolences to the families of the victims, to Turkey's Jewish 
community, and to all the people of the Turkish Republic.
