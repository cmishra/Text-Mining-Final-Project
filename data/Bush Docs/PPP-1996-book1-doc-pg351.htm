Statement on Food and Drug Administration Approval of an
HIV/AIDS Drug
March 1, 1996

    Our national investment in AIDS research is paying off. Among 
scientists, as among many people living with HIV, despair is giving way 
to hope. We cannot stop now. We must recommit ourselves to finding a 
cure.

Note: The statement referred to the Food and Drug Administration's 
approval of the second protease inhibitor to treat HIV/AIDS.
