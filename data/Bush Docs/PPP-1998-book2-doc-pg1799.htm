Message to the Congress Transmitting the Lithuania-United States
Fishery Agreement
October 14, 1998

To the Congress of the United States:
    In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement 
between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of the Republic of Lithuania extending the Agreement of 
November 12, 1992, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United 
States, with annex, as extended (``the 1992 Agreement''). The present 
Agreement, which was effected by an exchange of notes in Washington on 
April 20, September 16 and September 17, 1998, extends the 1992 
Agreement to December 31, 2001.
    In light of the importance of our fisheries relationship with the 
Republic of Lithuania, I urge that the Congress give favorable 
consideration to this Agreement at an early date.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

October 14, 1998.
