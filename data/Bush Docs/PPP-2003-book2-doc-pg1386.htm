Statement on Senate Action To Block a Vote on Class Action Reform 
Legislation
October 23, 2003

    Yesterday, 39 Members of the U.S. Senate blocked an up-or-down vote 
on a bill that would reduce frivolous lawsuits and the burden they place 
on our economy. The ``Class Action Fairness Act'' would protect the 
legal rights of all citizens while ensuring that court awards and 
settlements go to those who are wrongfully injured rather than to a few 
wealthy trial lawyers. Class action reform will allow businesses and 
their employees to go back to the business of growing our economy and 
creating jobs. It was passed by the House and is favored by a large 
bipartisan majority in the Senate. Those who are serious about bringing 
an end to frivolous lawsuits in this Nation and protecting the rights of 
those who are wrongfully injured should strongly support this 
legislation. I am eager to sign it; our economy needs it; and I urge 
those Senators who stand in the way to let the will of the people be 
heard.
