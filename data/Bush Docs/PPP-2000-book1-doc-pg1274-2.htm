Statement on the Supreme Court Decision To Uphold
Miranda v. Arizona
June 26, 2000

    In 1966 the Supreme Court decided in Miranda v. Arizona that law 
enforcement officials must give certain warnings, including a suspect's 
right to remain silent and to have counsel, before criminal suspects are 
questioned in custody. I am very pleased that today the Supreme Court by 
a large majority, has affirmed that ruling and upheld the important 
constitutional rights protected by Miranda. As Chief Justice 
Rehnquist's<Rehnquist, William H.<ls-thn-eq> opinion notes, the warnings 
have become part of our national culture; they have worked for law 
enforcement by providing clear standards for our officers; and they have 
worked to protect the rights of our citizens. I am pleased that today's 
opinion so resoundingly reinforces the important place of the Miranda 
warnings in our Nation's criminal justice system.
