Statement on the Return of Mir Aimal Kansi to the United States
June 18, 1997

    I want to express my deep appreciation to the FBI, CIA, and the 
Departments of State, Justice, and Defense for their extraordinary work 
in bringing Mir Aimal Kansi to the United States. Kansi is believed to 
be responsible for the killing of two CIA employees and the wounding of 
three others in an attack on January 25, 1993. The men and women who 
participated in the effort to bring Kansi here showed great courage in 
carrying out this mission.
    The success in apprehending Kansi demonstrates that we are 
determined to do what

is necessary to track down terrorists and bring them to justice. The 
United States will not relent in the pursuit of those who use violence 
against Americans to advance their goals--no matter how long it takes, 
no matter where they hide.
    Today our thoughts are also with the families of the victims. 
Although nothing can restore their loss, we hope that the prospect of 
justice in this case will bring them a measure of comfort.
