Radio Remarks on the Observance of Memorial Day
May 31, 1999

    Since the Civil War, Memorial Day has been a time for Americans to 
take a moment from our busy lives to remember the brave men and women 
who gave their lives in service to our Nation.
    This has been a century of great progress for the United States, but 
we must never forget that it came with a heavy price. At home and 
abroad, our victories over adversity were made possible by those who 
were prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, and those who did make 
that sacrifice.
    Today most Americans will enjoy a well-deserved day off from the 
cares of work and school; we'll relax at home and cherish the company of 
loved ones. But as we contemplate the comforts and blessings of our 
lives and the well-being of our Nation, I ask you to pause just for a 
moment to remember those who gave their lives to protect the values that 
give meaning to our lives. I ask you also to think of our men and women 
in uniform who are risking their lives in the skies over Serbia, so that 
our children may inhabit a world where people are not murdered and 
driven from their homes because of their faith or their heritage.
    As our Armed Forces and our allies strive to build peace in the 
Balkans, and in other

places far from America's shores, let us all join in thanking them for 
all they do every day to defend our freedom.

Note: The President's remarks were recorded at 5:31 p.m. on May 30 at 
the White Oak Plantation in Yulee, FL, for later broadcast. The 
transcript was released by the Office of the Press Secretary on May 31, 
but due to technical difficulties the audio version was not made 
available.
