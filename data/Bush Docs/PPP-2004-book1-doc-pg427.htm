Remarks Honoring NCAA Fall Championship Teams
March 23, 2004

    Thank you for coming. Behave yourself up on the balcony. [Laughter] 
That would be you. This is Champions Day here at the White House, and it 
is my honor to welcome some great champs. We are proud you're here.
    I want to thank those who represent the universities, here present. 
James Moeser,<Moeser, James<ls-thn-eq> the chancellor, and Dick 
Baddour,<Baddour, Dick<ls-thn-eq> the athletic director of the 
University of North Carolina, we appreciate you being here. Mike 
Garrett,<Garrett, Mike<ls-thn-eq> who is the athletic director of the 
University of Southern California, is with us today. Bill 
Jenkins,<Jenkins, William L.<ls-thn-eq> who is the president of LSU, 
along with Roger Ogden,<Ogden, Roger H.<ls-thn-eq> who is the chairman 
of the LSU Board of Supervisors, and Skip Bertman,<Bertman, J. Stanley 
``Skip''<ls-thn-eq> who is the athletic director, we're proud you're 
here.

    As you can probably see, we've got some Members of the United States 
Congress with us here today, and there seems to be quite a large and 
vibrant delegation from the great State of Louisiana. Senator John 
Breaux<Breaux, John B.<ls-thn-eq> and Mary Landrieu<Landrieu, Mary 
L.<ls-thn-eq> are with us today, mighty Tiger fans. Richard Baker<Baker, 
Richard H.<ls-thn-eq> and Jim McCrery<McCrery, James O.<ls-thn-eq> and 
Chris John<John, Christopher<ls-thn-eq> and Rodney Alexander,<Alexander, 
Rodney<ls-thn-eq> thank you all for coming. We're proud you're here. 
From California, Congressman Chris Cox<Cox, Christopher<ls-thn-eq> and 
Diane Watson<Watson, Diane E.<ls-thn-eq>are with us today. Thank you all 
for coming. Congressmen David Price<Price, David<ls-thn-eq> and Mike 
McIntyre<McIntyre, Mike<ls-thn-eq> from North Carolina are with us as 
well. Thank you all for being here.
    First, it's my honor to recognize the football cochamps this year, 
LSU and USC, fantastic group of athletes and teams that battled to the 
end. Any good team obviously requires good players; these teams have got 
good players, but it also requires really good coaches. Pete 
Carroll<Carroll, Pete<ls-thn-eq> and Nick Saban<Saban, Nick<ls-thn-eq> 
are two of the finest coaches in the United States. We're glad you're 
here. There was quite a lot of discussion about who really was number 
one. My attitude is, the South Lawn is a pretty good size. [Laughter] 
Never mind. [Laughter] I appreciate the class of these two programs and 
the grace they demonstrated under pressure. Both schools, LSU and USC, 
are, in fact, national champs. And we're proud to call you national 
champs.
    Obviously, in order to be a national champ, you've got to field fine 
players at every position. I particularly want to say something about 
USC tailback Reggie Bush.<Bush, Reggie<ls-thn-eq> Where is he? His 
teammates call him ``the President''--[laughter]--``President Bush.'' 
You must feel pretty comfortable here at the White House, ``President 
Bush.'' [Laughter]
    I also want to say one other word about an individual who is not 
with us today, and that is Jeff Boss,<Boss, Jeff<ls-thn-eq> who was the 
equipment manager for 24 years for LSU. Last October he died from 
cancer. The Tigers named their locker room in Jeff's honor, and they 
kept his family in their prayers throughout the season. You all know and 
I know that Jeff would be incredibly proud of the fact that LSU won its 
first national championship in 45 years. May God bless Jeff and his 
family, and may God bless both the USC team and the LSU football team. 
Thank you all for coming.
    Now it's my honor to welcome back the Lady Trojans volleyball team 
from USC. They did pretty well this year. They were 35-0. [Laughter] 
Last year, I had the honor of welcoming my friend Mick Haley<Haley, 
Mick<ls-thn-eq> here to the White House. See, Mick used to coach the 
University of Texas volleyball team, and I used to work out at the gym 
there, and he used to come over and give me pointers all the time about 
how to strengthen up and look a little better. My advice is, when you 
see the Governor of California,<Schwarzenegger, Arnold A.<ls-thn-eq> he 
doesn't need many pointers, Mick. [Laughter]
    Mick's<Haley, Mick<ls-thn-eq> a good man. He coaches a group of 
great ladies who are, in fact, national champs. I asked how many of them 
are coming back next year. Of course, one of them asked if I was. 
[Laughter] But he has a lot of returners for next year, and this group 
of champs is welcome here at the White House any time. Thank you for 
coming.
    Then we honor Coach Anson Dorrance's<Dorrance, Anson<ls-thn-eq> UNC 
Tarheel women's soccer team. Anson's got a pretty good record. He's 
coached for 25 years, and he's won 18 national championships. That's the 
sign of a good coach who knows good talent and knows how to mold 
everybody into a good team. This year they were 32-0. When I had my 
honor of having my picture taken with the team, I asked what was the 
closest match, closest game. One of the ladies said it was 3-0. That's a 
heck of a team, 32-0 and the closest game is 3-0. UNC gets a lot of 
attention for its basketball team, but let me remind you of what the 
legendary coach Dean Smith<Smith, Dean<ls-thn-eq> said. He said, ``UNC 
is a women's soccer school.'' And

once again, these ladies have proven Coach Dean Smith correct. Welcome 
back.
    Jerry Yeagley<Yeagley, Jerry<ls-thn-eq> is here with the Indiana 
Hoosier men's soccer team. He's been with the Hoosiers for three 
decades, and in those 30 years they have won six national titles. He 
retired last fall with 544 wins, more than any coach in NCAA Division I 
history. Coach Yeagley, we're proud of you. We're proud of the team 
you've brought here. We're proud of your dedication to athletics. I want 
to thank you for working so hard to teach the young men of your teams 
the difference between right and wrong and how to play as a team. Today 
we honor your coaching career at the same time we honor the great 
Indiana Hoosier soccer team. Welcome.
    These are impressive athletes behind me, but I think if you really 
look beyond the athletics, you'll find some decent and compassionate 
people as well. These athletes, in the most part, understand they have a 
responsibility to uphold to the communities in which they live. They 
understand it's one thing to be a champ on the field; it's another to be 
a champ off the field by setting the right example for some youngster 
who is wondering what it means to be a champ.
    By sending good messages about right and wrong behavior and by 
volunteering in their community--the USC football team makes a trip to 
the USC Children's Hospital every year to visit patients and to give 
gifts and to sign autographs. You know what they're doing? They're 
bringing some sunshine into somebody's life, is what they're doing. The 
LSU football players visit hospitals, and they teach elementary school 
children how to read. They're taking their talents off the football 
field and putting them in the classroom, so some child in Louisiana has 
a chance to realize a better life. The USC women's volleyball team 
raised money and participated together in the Race for the Cure for 
breast cancer research. They took their athleticism and put it into 
practice to help save somebody's life. The UNC women's soccer team is 
helping to build a Habitat for Humanity house near the campus. They're 
using their God-given talents to make sure somebody has a place to live. 
And finally, the Indiana soccer players volunteer as coaches and mentors 
for youth soccer teams in Bloomington, Indiana.
    All these players have understood it's important to serve something 
greater than yourself in life. They learned to do so by working together 
for a team, and they're learning to do so by making the community in 
which they live a better place for every citizen.
    It is my honor to welcome true champs here to the White House. I 
congratulate you for your hard work. I wish you all the best for the--
whatever the future may hold. God bless you all.

Note: The President spoke at 3:21 p.m. on the South Lawn at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Pete Carroll, head football coach,

Southern California women's volleyball; Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of 
California; Anson Dorrance, head coach, University of North Carolina 
women's soccer; Dean Smith, former head coach, University of North
