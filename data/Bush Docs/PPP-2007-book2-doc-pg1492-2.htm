    President Bush. Mr. President, welcome.
    President Abbas. Thank you.
    President Bush. Yes. It's good to have you back here in the Oval 
Office. Thank you for coming, and thank you for working hard to 
implement a vision for a Palestinian state.
    We want to help you. We want there to be peace. We want the people 
in the Palestinian Territories to have hope. And we thank you for your 
willingness to sit down with Israel to negotiate the settlement.
    The United States cannot impose our vision, but we can help 
facilitate. And the process will begin tonight at the State Department 
and then on to Annapolis tomorrow. And I want to thank you for coming. 
Wish you all the very best.
    President Abbas. I am delighted to have the opportunity to meet with 
President Bush after his invitation and this historic initiative that he

hope that this conference will produce a permanent status negotiations,

administration in order to achieve the intended objective. Thank you.
