Statement on the Cuban Government's Sentencing of Human Rights Activists
March 15, 1999

    I am deeply disappointed that the Cuban Government has sentenced 
four courageous human rights activists--Vladimiro Roca,<Roca, 
Vladimiro> Felix Bonne,<Bonne, Felix> Rene Gomez 
Manzano,<Gomez Manzano, Rene> and <Beatriz Roque, 
Marta>Marta Beatriz Roque--to prison terms. They did nothing 
more than assert their right to speak freely about their country's 
future, call on their Government to respect basic human rights, and seek 
a peaceful transition to democracy for the long-suffering Cuban people. 
They were tried without a fair process, behind closed doors. I call on 
the Cuban Government to release them immediately.
