Remarks on Lighting the National Christmas Tree
December 7, 2006

    Thank you all very much. Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are 
pleased to welcome you to the Christmas Pageant of Peace. Christmas is a 
season of glad tidings and a time when our thoughts turn to the source 
of joy and hope born in a humble manger 2000 years ago. And tonight we 
gather to observe one of the great traditions of our Nation's Capital, 
the lighting of the National Christmas Tree.
    I'm really glad Santa made it. [Laughter] I'm glad he could find a 
place to park. [Laughter] And I'm glad you all joined us tonight.
    I want to thank Vin<Cipolla, Vin<ls-thn-eq> for his leadership of 
the National Park Foundation. I thank Deputy Secretary of the Interior 
Lynn Scarlett<Scarlett, P. Lynn<ls-thn-eq> for joining us. I am pleased 
to be here with members of my Cabinet; Members of the Congress; Mary 
Bomar,<Bomar, Mary A.<ls-thn-eq> who is the Director of the National 
Park Service; Joe Lawler,<Lawler, Joseph M.<ls-thn-eq> Regional Director 
of the National Capital Region, National Park

Service. I want to thank all the National Park Service employees for 
their hard work.
    I appreciate Dr. Robert Schuller<Schuller, Robert H.<ls-thn-eq> for 
leading the invocation. I want to thank our fabulous entertainers for 
entertaining us tonight.
    We have gathered for this ceremony for more than 80 years. We come 
together to celebrate a simple and inspiring story. It's a story of a 
miraculous birth in a humble place. It is a story of a single life that 
changed the world and continues to change hearts. And for two millennia, 
this story has carried the message that God is with us and He offers His 
love to every man, woman, and child.
    During the Christmas season, we seek to reflect that love in our 
lives. Millions of Americans will celebrate at home in fellowship with 
friends and family. Millions will reach out with a compassionate hand to 
help brothers and sisters in need. And all will give thanks to the bonds 
of love and affection that bring fulfillment to our lives and the hope 
of peace around the world.
    At this time of year, we give thanks for the brave men and women in 
uniform who are serving our Nation. Many of those who have answered the 
call of duty will spend this Christmas season far from home and 
separated from family. We honor their sacrifice. We are proud of their 
service and that of their families. We will keep them close to our 
hearts and in our prayers.
    And now, as an expression of our own hope for peace in this 
Christmas season, we will light the National Tree. We've asked<Jenkins, 
Attiyah<ls-thn-eq> three<Scott, Stephen<ls-thn-eq> 
representatives<Bederson, Dana<ls-thn-eq> from the National Park 
Service's Junior Ranger Program to help. The Junior Ranger Program 
teaches children and families about science, nature, and stewardship of 
our national parks.
    And so Attiyah Jenkins,<Jenkins, Attiyah<ls-thn-eq> Stephen 
Scott,<Scott, Stephen<ls-thn-eq> and Dana Bederson<Bederson, 
Dana<ls-thn-eq> will help me light the National Christmas Tree. Come on 
up, guys.
    I ask all of you to join us in the countdown: five, four, three, 
two, one.

Note: The President spoke at 5:55 p.m. on the Ellipse at the White 
House. In his remarks, he referred to Vin Cipolla, president and chief 
executive officer, National Park Foundation; and Robert H. Schuller, 
minister, Reformed Church in America.
