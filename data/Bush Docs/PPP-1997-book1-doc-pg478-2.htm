Message on the Observance of Take Our Daughters to Work Day
April 23, 1997

    Warm greetings to everyone participating in ``Take Our Daughters to 
Work Day.'' We dedicate this special day each year to empowering girls 
with the encouragement and practical work

experiences that will enable them to become leaders in the workplace of 
the future.
    Young girls must never believe that there are limitations on what 
they can do or become in this country. That's why all of us have a 
responsibility to renew our commitment to gender equality not only at 
work, but also in our homes, schools, and communities. It is time to 
treat our children the same, to embrace their unique gifts, and to allow 
them to utilize their God-given talents as they choose.
    As parents, family members, mentors, and teachers, we also have an 
obligation to introduce our children to new experiences and to extend 
their education beyond the boundaries of the classroom. If we are to 
fulfill the exciting promise of the twenty-first century, we must 
instill in our girls and boys a deep appreciation for lifelong learning 
and the confidence and self-esteem to live out their dreams.
    I commend the thousands of families, businesses, schools, and 
communities participating in ``Take Our Daughters to Work Day'' for 
showing America's young women that we believe in them and in their 
ability to lead us in the years to come. You are making a lasting 
investment in America's future.
    Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a memorable 
observance.

                                                            Bill Clinton
