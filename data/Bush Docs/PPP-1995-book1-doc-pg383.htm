Memorandum on the 1995 United States Savings Bonds Campaign
March 22, 1995

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

    The 1995 Federal U.S. Savings Bonds Campaign will soon be underway. 
Attached is a special message to all Federal employees who are eligible 
to take part in this campaign. Please give this letter appropriate 
distribution within your organization to enhance your campaign.
    I encourage you to also generate a letter for each of your 
Department or Agency employees. Good luck on a successful campaign. I 
look forward to receiving your results later this year.

                                                      William J. Clinton
