Message to the Senate on Ratification of the Protocols of Accession to 
NATO for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic
May 21, 1998

To the Senate of the United States:
    I am gratified that the United States Senate has given its advice 
and consent to the ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic 
Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech 
Republic.
    The Senate's decisive vote was a milestone on the road to an 
undivided, democratic and peaceful Europe. The message this vote sends 
is clear: American support for NATO is firm, our leadership on both 
sides of the Atlantic is strong, and there is a solid bipartisan 
foundation for an active U.S. role in transatlantic security.
    I thank Majority Leader Lott,<Lott, Trent<ls-thn-eq> Minority Leader 
Daschle,<Daschle, Thomas A.<ls-thn-eq> Senators Helms<Helms, 
Jesse<ls-thn-eq> and Biden,<Biden, Joseph R., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> Senator 
Roth<Roth, William V., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> and the members of the NATO 
Observer Group, and the many others who have devoted so much time and 
energy to this historic effort. The continuous dialogue and consultation 
between the Administration and the Congress on this issue was a model of 
bipartisan partnership. I am committed to ensuring that this partnership 
continues and deepens as we proceed toward NATO's 50th anniversary 
summit next year in Washington.
    The resolution of ratification that the Senate has adopted contains 
provisions addressing a broad range of issues of interest and concern, 
and I will implement the conditions it contains. As I have indicated 
following approval of earlier treaties, I will of course do so without 
prejudice to my authorities as President under the Constitution, 
including my authorities with respect to the conduct of foreign policy. 
I note in this connection that conditions in a resolution of advice and 
consent cannot alter the allocations of authority and responsibility 
under the Constitution.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

May 21, 1998.
