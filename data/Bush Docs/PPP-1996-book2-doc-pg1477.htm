Statement on the Meeting Between Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu of 
Israel and Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority
September 4, 1996

    I welcome the meeting today between Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu 
and PLO Chairman Arafat. The meeting between the two leaders is a very 
important step in developing an Israeli-Palestinian partnership so 
essential to implementation of their agreements. Indeed, it reflects 
their continuing commitment to resolving their differences through 
negotiations and to securing a lasting peace.
    I look forward to meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu next Monday 
to review progress and discuss developments in the region.
