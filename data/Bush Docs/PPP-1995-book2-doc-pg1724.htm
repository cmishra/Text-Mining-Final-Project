Remarks Following a Meeting With President Ezer Weizman of Israel in 
Jerusalem
November 6, 1995

    First, let me just say how pleased I am to have had the opportunity 
to come here for a second time to visit with President Weizman on this 
very, very sad day for Israel and for the United States. I want to 
emphasize today the support of the American people for the people of 
Israel. It is evidenced by our delegation here. We have three American 
Presidents, three American Secretaries of State, almost 40 Members of 
our Congress, including the leadership of both parties in both Houses of 
our Congress, and a very distinguished group of American religious and 
business leaders, all coming here to express our support and our 
solidarity, our grief over the death of Prime Minister Rabin and our 
support for the process of peace.
    But for me, this is not a day to discuss the future or policies 
beyond what I have already said. I think you can see, by the kind of 
delegation that came from the United States, how strongly we feel about 
our support for Israel and how strongly we feel about our support for 
peace.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at approximately 5:20 p.m. outside President 
Weizman's residence. A
