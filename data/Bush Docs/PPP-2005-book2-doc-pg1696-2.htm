Remarks After Signing the Book of Condolence at the Jordanian Embassy
November 10, 2005

    Mr. Ambassador,<Kawar, Karim Tawfiq<ls-thn-eq> thank you for 
receiving us. We have come to your Embassy to express our heartfelt 
sympathies for the people of Jordan and for the families who are 
grieving today because of the murder of innocent people.
    I spoke to His Majesty<King Abdullah II<ls-thn-eq> this morning and 
conveyed these very same thoughts. And during my conversation, as he 
described the fact that these bombers went into a wedding and killed 
people there that were there to celebrate life, killed innocent--the 
bombers killed innocent women and children, it struck me, Mr. 
Ambassador,<Kawar, Karim Tawfiq<ls-thn-eq> that--once again, that we 
face an enemy that has no heart, an enemy that is defiling a great 
religion, of Islam. Today--yesterday in Jordan, Muslims died at the 
hands of these killers simply because they were in

the wrong hotel, simply because they wanted to be with their families 
and enjoy life.
    This enemy must be defeated. They have no heart. They have no 
conscience.
    I want to thank you and the good people of Jordan for standing 
strong against these merciless killers. And we ask for God's blessings 
on the people of Jordan.

Note: The President spoke at 4:27 p.m. In his remarks, he referred to 
Jordan's Ambassador to the U.S. Karim Tawfiq Kawar; and King Abdullah II 
of Jordan.
