Memorandum on Electronic Government's Role in Implementing the 
President's Management Agenda
July 9, 2002

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies

Subject: Electronic Government's Role in Implementing the President's 
Management Agenda

    My Administration's vision for Government reform is guided by three 
principles. Government should be citizen-centered, results-oriented, and 
market-based. These principles have been woven into the five Government-
wide reform goals outlined in my Administration's Management Agenda: 
strategic management of human capital, budget and performance 
integration, competitive sourcing, expanded use of the internet and 
computer resources to provide Government services (Electronic-Government 
or E-Government), and improved financial management. Effective 
implementation of E-Government is important in making Government more 
responsive and cost-effective.
    Our success depends on agencies working as a team across traditional 
boundaries to better serve the American people, focusing on citizens 
rather than individual agency needs. I thank agencies who have actively 
engaged in cross-agency teamwork, using E-Government to create more 
cost-effective and efficient ways to serve citizens, and I urge others 
to follow their lead.

                                                          George W. Bush

Note: This memorandum was released by the Office of the Press Secretary 
on July 10.
