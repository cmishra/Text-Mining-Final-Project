Statement on Surgeon General Nominee Joycelyn Elders
July 30, 1993

    I am pleased that the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources 
has recognized the talents and capabilities of Dr. Joycelyn Elders. As 
Surgeon General, she will be an effective advocate for clinical and 
educational programs to address the fundamental health and social 
problems that affect all Americans. I am especially grateful to Chairman 
Kennedy for his steady leadership during the committee's consideration 
of Dr. Elders' nomination. I look forward to her speedy confirmation by 
the full Senate.
