December 8, 2008

    Children. Thank you.

    The President.  Yes. We're excited you are here. And we're excited

people's eyes when they get to see the majesty of the White House at 
this time of year. And I'm looking in your eyes, and I'm seeing wonder.

introduce my wife. [Laughter] It's a pretty neat thing, isn't it?
