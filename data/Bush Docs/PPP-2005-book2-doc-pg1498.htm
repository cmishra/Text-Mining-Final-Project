To the Congress of the United States:
    Consistent with title I of the District of Columbia Appropriations 
Act, 2005, Public Law 108-335, I am notifying the Congress of the 
proposed use of $10,151,538 provided in title I under the heading

of public safety expenses related to security events and responses to 
terrorist threats.

the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
