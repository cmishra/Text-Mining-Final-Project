Statement on the Situation in Burma
May 27, 2008

    I am deeply troubled by the Burmese regime's extension of National 
League for Democracy general secretary and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung 
San Suu Kyi's<Aung San Suu Kyi<ls-thn-eq> house arrest on May 27. Aung 
San Suu Kyi's current house arrest dates back to May 2003, when she was 
detained following the murderous assault by regime-sponsored thugs on 
her motorcade in Depayin. The United States calls upon the regime to 
release all political prisoners in Burma and begin a genuine dialogue 
with Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy, and other 
democratic and ethnic minority groups on a transition to democracy.
    The United States will continue to help the people of Burma recover 
from the devastation of Cyclone Nargis and will continue to support the 
Burmese people's long-term struggle for freedom. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I look forward to the day when the people of Burma 
know true liberty and democracy.
