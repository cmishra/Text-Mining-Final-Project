Exchange With Reporters Prior to Discussions With Andres Manuel Lopez 
Obrador of Mexico's Democratic Revolutionary Party in Mexico City
May 6, 1997

    Q. Mr. President, why did you decide to be the first American 
President to meet with opposition leaders?
    The President. Because we support the political reform process in 
Mexico, and I do this in other countries, in Russia, Israel, other 
countries I visit. So I thought it was important.
