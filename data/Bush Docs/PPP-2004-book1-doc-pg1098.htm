Statement on the Death of Ray Charles<Robinson, Ray Charles<ls-thn-eq>
June 18, 2004

    Ray Charles Robinson was a hero--the child who faced down adversity 
and worked hard to become one of the greatest examples of the American 
Dream. His songs have lifted us in times of sorrow and helped us 
celebrate in times of joy.
    His music and his optimism touched the lives and hearts of millions 
and spanned generations, cultures, races, and backgrounds. People from 
all walks of life would come together and tap their feet as one when Ray 
Charles played.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our prayers and condolences 
to his family and friends.
