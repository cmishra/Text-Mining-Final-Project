Remarks Prior to Discussions With President Nelson Mandela of
South Africa
October 5, 1994

    Hello, everybody. Let me say very briefly--as you know, President 
Mandela and I will have statements and answer questions after we have 
our meeting. But I do want to say again how pleased we are to have him 
here. This has been both a summit meeting and a celebration for so many 
Americans who have so strongly supported South African democracy. And 
now we're in the process of working on the future, planning for the 
future, and seeing what we can do to be of help.
    And I'm looking forward to this meeting. And as I said, we'll be 
glad to answer your questions after it occurs.

Note: The President spoke at 2:30 p.m. in the Oval Office at the White 
House. A tape was not available for verification of the content of these 
remarks.
