Message to the Senate Transmitting the Slovenia-United States Tax 
Convention
September 13, 1999

To the Senate of the United States:
    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Convention Between the United States of America and the Republic of 
Slovenia for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of 
Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, signed at 
Ljubljana on June 21, 1999. Also transmitted is the report of the 
Department of State concerning the Convention.
    This Convention, which is similar to tax treaties between the United 
States and OECD nations, provides maximum rates of tax to be applied to 
various types of income and protection from double taxation of income. 
This Convention also provides for resolution of disputes and sets forth 
rules making its benefits unavailable to residents who are engaged in 
treaty-shopping or with respect to certain abusive transactions.
    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to this Convention and that the Senate give its advice and consent to 
ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,

September 13, 1999.
