Message on the Observance of Cinco de Mayo, 2003
May 5, 2003

    I send greetings to those celebrating Cinco de Mayo.
    Today, millions of people in Mexico and around the world honor the 
heritage of a proud people by remembering the heroic Battle of Puebla. 
On May 5th, 1862, Mexico's General Ignacio Zaragoza and his troops 
achieved a remarkable victory in the face of tremendous challenge and 
helped secure Mexico's freedom. This example of courage and sacrifice 
continues to inspire us today, as we are reminded that people of every 
culture, of every race, and every background, yearn to be free.
    This observance also provides an opportunity for the United States 
to recognize the invaluable contributions of Mexican Americans to our 
country. Through their vibrant culture and deep commitment to faith, 
family, and community, Mexican Americans have enriched our society and 
contributed to the diversity that makes our Nation strong. We also 
recognize the many Mexican Americans serving in our Armed Forces who are 
working to bring freedom and justice to oppressed people. As we remember 
our two countries' shared history and common values, we look forward to 
a future of continued friendship and prosperity.
    Laura<Bush, Laura> joins me in sending our best wishes for 
a memorable celebration.

                                                          George W. Bush
