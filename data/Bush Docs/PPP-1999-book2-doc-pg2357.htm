Statement on the Death of Elliot Richardson<Richardson, 
Elliot>
December 31, 1999

    Hillary and I were saddened to learn that Elliot Richardson died 
today in Boston. Elliot Richardson was a man of uncommon integrity, who 
put the Nation's interests first even when the personal cost was very 
high. He was an unparalleled public servant, a lawyer, a diplomat, a 
soldier, and a prosecutor. America was honored by his service, and we 
will miss him.
