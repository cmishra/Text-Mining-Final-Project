Memorandum on Increasing Seatbelt Use
January 23, 1997

Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation

Subject: Increasing Seatbelt Use Nationwide

    We have made steady progress in improving highway safety over the 
years. However, there are still far too many tragic and unnecessary 
deaths and injuries on the Nation's roads. As a first line of defense, 
we must all wear seatbelts. Seatbelts protect passengers not only in 
frontal crashes, but also in side, rear, and rollover crashes, saving 
about 10,000 lives a year. I understand that about 70 percent of the 
population use seatbelts. Increasing seatbelt use will clearly save more 
lives and reduce injuries.
    I hereby direct you, working with the Congress, the States, and 
other concerned Americans, including the automobile and insurance 
industries, and safety and consumer groups, to report back to me in 45 
days with a plan to increase the use of seatbelts nationwide. The plan 
shall address, among other things, the State laws that require the use 
of seatbelts, assistance from the Department of Transportation to 
improve those State laws, and a comprehensive education campaign on 
behalf of the public and private sector to help the public understand 
the need to wear seatbelts.
    You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

                                                      William J. Clinton

Note: This memorandum was not received for publication in the Federal 
Register.
