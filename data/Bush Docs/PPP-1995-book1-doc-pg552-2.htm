Letter to Governor Frank Keating on Disaster Assistance to Oklahoma City
April 19, 1995

Dear Governor Keating:
    I have declared an emergency under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act) for the city of 
Oklahoma City in the State of Oklahoma due to the explosion at the 
Federal courthouse in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 in the State of 
Oklahoma. I have authorized Federal relief and emergency assistance in 
the affected area.
    Emergency assistance under Title V of the Stafford Act will be 
provided. Assistance under this emergency declaration will be provided 
at 100 percent Federal funding.
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate 
Federal assistance efforts and designate specific areas eligible for 
such assistance. The Federal Coordinating Officer will be Mr. Dell Greer 
of FEMA. He will consult with you and assist in the execution of the 
FEMA-State Agreement governing the expenditure of Federal funds.
    Sincerely,

                                                            Bill Clinton

Note: This letter was attached to a statement by Press Secretary Mike 
McCurry announcing disaster assistance to Oklahoma City, OK.
