Statement on Ending the Filibuster on National Service Legislation
July 30, 1993

    By breaking the gridlock and ending the filibuster on national 
service today, the Senate scored two victories. It won one for the 
American people, but it also won one for the Senate itself, showing that 
when Democrats and Republicans work together, we can move America ahead.
    National service will be America at its best, energizing our youth, 
meeting our Nation's needs, and reuniting all of us in the common work 
of citizenship. This legislation joins our Nation's finest traditions of 
building community, rewarding responsibility, and offering opportunity.
    I want in particular to thank those Republicans who found the 
courage and vision to support this landmark legislation. When we put 
partisanship behind us and work together, we really can change America.
