                                Foreword

    I began the last six months of my term optimistic about the future 
of our country and grateful for the good fortune of this productive and 
historic time.

    Never before had our nation enjoyed so much prosperity and social 
progress with no deep domestic crisis or overwhelming foreign threat to 
darken the prospect of progress. A spirit of possibility pervaded the 
Washington atmosphere and brought significant legislative 
accomplishments, which was remarkable in an election season.

    The Congress passed our Lands Legacy initiative to provide long term 
funding to purchase precious lands from wilderness areas to urban 
greenspaces; increased funding for childcare and breast and cervical 
cancer treatment; doubled support for after-school programs, enough to 
serve 1.6 million children; enacted the largest increase in Head Start 
ever and the funds necessary to hire 35,000 new teachers; and passed the 
New Markets legislation, the last major bill I signed, designed to give 
Americans the same financial incentives to invest in poor neighborhoods 
and rural and Native American communities as they have to invest in 
Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

    Congress also passed our plans to increase trade with Africa and our 
Caribbean neighbors; extended normal trade relations with China, paving 
the way for its entry into the World Trade Organization; enacted the 
historic Debt Relief Initiative, to forgive the foreign debts of the 
world's poorest nations, but only if they invest all the savings in 
education, health care, and economic development; and provided funding 
for Plan Colombia, to help Latin America's oldest democracy and her 
neighbors fight drug trafficking.

    The Administration took a number of groundbreaking executive 
actions, including setting aside over 40 million roadless acres in our 
national forests, a decision characterized by the Audubon Society as the 
most important conservation move in forty years; establishing several 
more national monuments in environmentally sensitive areas; raising the 
standards for arsenic in water; providing $300 million to feed 9 million 
poor children in the poorest nations if they come to school to get the 
meal; concluding trade agreements with Vietnam and Jordan, with the 
Jordanian agreement being the first ever to include environmental and 
labor standards; and laying the foundation for ending North Korea's 
dangerous missile program.

    Of course, there were disappointments. I was unsuccessful in 
persuading Congress to pass a meaningful Patient's Bill of Rights; 
prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program for senior 
citizens; and a Hate Crimes bill, making a federal offense of violent 
crimes motivated by the victim's gender, disability, or sexual 
orientation. I am optimistic that all these bills will eventually pass.

    My greatest disappointment was our failure to make a comprehensive 
peace agreement in the Middle East, notwithstanding arduous talks at 
Camp David and afterward in the region. I believe if a peace agreement 
is ever reached it will have to include the essential elements in the 
last American proposal, which brought the parties so close to peace at 
Taba.

    I was honored to be the first President in forty years to visit 
Okinawa for the G-8 Summit and to make a second trip to Africa, this 
time to Tanzania, to work with President Mandela on the Burundi Peace 
Talks, and to Nigeria to support President Obasanjo's effort to reform 
Africa's largest nation and to intensify the struggle against AIDS.

    In September I joined more than 160 heads of government at the 
United Nations Millennium Summit to discuss the great challenges facing 
us at the dawn of the new century: the fights against poverty, 
infectious diseases, lack of education, global warming, terrorism, and 
weapons of mass destruction. I addressed the General Assembly for the 
last time as President, using this opportunity to urge the other leaders 
present to foster a greater respect for our common humanity and to 
embrace the diverse political, cultural, and religious beliefs and 
histories that make our world so rich and wonderful.

                                 Preface

    This book contains the papers and speeches of the 42d President of 
the United States that were issued by the Office of the Press Secretary 
during the period June 27-October 11, 2000. The material has been 
compiled and published by the Office of the Federal Register, National 
Archives and Records Administration.

    The material is presented in chronological order, and the dates 
shown in the headings are the dates of the documents or events. In 
instances when the release date differs from the date of the document 
itself, that fact is shown in the textnote. Every effort has been made 
to ensure accuracy: Remarks are checked against a tape recording, and 
signed documents are checked against the original. Textnotes and cross 
references have been provided by the editors for purposes of 
identification or clarity. Speeches were delivered in Washington, DC, 
unless indicated. The times noted are local times. All materials that 
are printed full-text in the book have been indexed in the subject and 
name indexes, and listed in the document categories list.

    The Public Papers of the Presidents series was begun in 1957 in 
response to a recommendation of the National Historical Publications 
Commission. An extensive compilation of messages and papers of the 
Presidents covering the period 1789 to 1897 was assembled by James D. 
Richardson and published under congressional authority between 1896 and 
1899. Since then, various private compilations have been issued, but 
there was no uniform publication comparable to the Congressional Record 
or the United States Supreme Court Reports. Many Presidential papers 
could be found only in the form of mimeographed White House releases or 
as reported in the press. The Commission therefore recommended the 
establishment of an official series in which Presidential writings, 
addresses, and remarks of a public nature could be made available.

    The Commission's recommendation was incorporated in regulations of 
the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register, issued under 
section 6 of the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. 1506), which may be 
found in title 1, part 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations.

    A companion publication to the Public Papers series, the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents, was begun in 1965 to provide a 
broader range of Presidential materials on a more timely basis to meet 
the needs of the contemporary reader. Beginning with the administration 
of Jimmy Carter, the Public Papers series expanded its coverage to 
include additional material as printed in the Weekly Compilation. That 
coverage provides a listing of the President's daily schedule and 
meetings, when announced, and other items of general interest issued by 
the Office of the Press Secretary. Also included are lists of the 
President's nominations submitted to the Senate, materials released by 
the Office of the Press Secretary that are not printed full-text in the 
book, and proclamations, Executive orders, and other Presidential 
documents released by the Office of the Press Secretary and published in 
the Federal Register. This information appears in the appendixes at the 
end of the book.

    Volumes covering the administrations of Presidents Hoover, Truman, 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush are 
also included in the Public Papers series.
