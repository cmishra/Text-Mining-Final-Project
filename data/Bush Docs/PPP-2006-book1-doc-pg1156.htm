Remarks at the Congressional Picnic
June 15, 2006

    Thank you all for coming. Welcome to the South Lawn. Laura<Bush, 
Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I are thrilled you're here. This is called ``Rodeo 
on the South Lawn.'' [Laughter] And we've--first of all, I want to thank 
all the Members of the Congress and the Senate who are here. Thanks for 
serving the country.
    I always take this opportunity to thank your families on your 
behalf. I know you do it all the time, but I know you couldn't serve 
without the support of your loved ones. And so, for all the family 
members who are here, the wives and the husbands and the children and 
the grandchildren, welcome. Thanks for serving the country too.
    We got some interesting entertainment for you tonight. We got some 
people who can play music and some people who think they can play music. 
[Laughter] We got three bands, one--the first band will be called The 
Compassionates. The leader of that band is my Chief of Staff, Josh 
Bolten.<Bolten, Joshua B.<ls-thn-eq>

Kenny<ls-thn-eq> Thaddeus<McCotter, Thaddeus G.<ls-thn-eq> McCotter--
he's that rock-and-roll dude, Thaddeus McCotter--and Congressman Jon 
Porter.<Porter, Jon C.<ls-thn-eq> Once you get through those two bands, 
then a real group of musicians will be here, and we're fortunate Riders 
in the Sky will be playing for you tonight.
    I hope you enjoy this as much as Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I 
enjoy it. We're really glad you're here. God bless you all, and God 
bless our great country. Please welcome The Compassionates.
