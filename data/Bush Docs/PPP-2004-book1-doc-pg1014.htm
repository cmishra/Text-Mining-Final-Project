Remarks at Saint Simon's Island, Georgia
June 8, 2004

    Thank you all very much for working at what you're doing. It's a 
great example of Federal, State, and local cooperation. I appreciate 
many of you taking time away from your families to make sure this event 
goes the way we want it to go, secure and peaceful. I know that you're 
working long hours, and I've come to thank you very much for what you're 
doing. It means a lot to me, and it means a lot to the people whose 
lives you're protecting.
    So I want to thank you very much, and I ask for God's blessings on 
you all and the country. Thank you very much.

Note: The President spoke at 6:32 p.m at the Multi-Agency Command 
Center.
