Statement on Burma's Release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi<Aung San Suu 
Kyi>
May 6, 2002

    The United States welcomes the release from house arrest of Burma's 
Nobel laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party won an overwhelming 
victory in elections in 1990 but was never allowed to assume power. We 
hope her release will be ``a new dawn'' for Burma, as Daw Aung San Suu 
Kyi told her supporters earlier today, and lead to national 
reconciliation and a restoration of democracy. All parties should seize 
this opportunity to press ahead with the urgent work of restoring the 
rule of law and basic political and civil rights for all Burmese. Only a

reintegration with the international community can bring the freedom and 
prosperity which the people of Burma both long for and deserve.
    The United States will closely monitor the situation within Burma as 
this process unfolds. We will also consult with ASEAN, Japan, the 
European Union, and other partners on how the international community 
can most effectively encourage further progress toward restoration of 
democracy. I compliment U.N. Special Envoy Razali Ismail<Ismail, 
Razali> for his tireless efforts to promote reconciliation 
within Burma and for helping to facilitate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's 
release.
