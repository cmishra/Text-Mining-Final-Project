Message to the Senate Transmitting a Protocol to the
Canada-United States Taxation Convention
September 14, 1994

To the Senate of the United States:

    I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification 
the Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States of 
America and Canada with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Signed 
at Washington on September 26, 1980, as amended by the Protocols signed 
on June 14, 1983, and March 28, 1984, signed at Washington August 31, 
1994. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report 
of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol.


[[Page 1554]]


    The Protocol further amends the Convention to reflect changes in 
U.S. and Canadian law and treaty policy and to make certain technical 
corrections to the existing Convention that are necessary because of the 
passage of time. It also improves the operation of the Convention and 
facilitates the flow of capital and technology between the United States 
and Canada.

    I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration 
to the Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.

                                                      William J. Clinton

The White House,
September 14, 1994.
