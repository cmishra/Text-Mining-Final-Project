Statement on Senate Passage of Military Commissions Legislation
September 28, 2006

    Today the Senate sent a strong signal to the terrorists that we will 
continue using every element of national power to pursue our enemies and 
to prevent attacks on America. The ``Military Commissions Act of 2006'' 
will allow the continuation of a CIA program that has been one of 
America's most potent tools in fighting the war on terror. Under this 
program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about 
threats against our country. Information we have learned from the 
program has helped save lives at home and abroad. By authorizing the 
creation of military commissions, the act will also allow us to 
prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes.
    Our most solemn responsibility is protecting America's security, and 
I thank the Senate for passing this vital legislation.

Note: The statement referred to S. 3930.
