Remarks Following a Meeting With Parochial Education Leaders and Parents
April 13, 2007

    Secretary Spellings<Spellings, Margaret<ls-thn-eq> and I have just 
had the privilege of talking to some of our country's leading 
educational entrepreneurs. We had the privilege of talking to parents 
whose lives have been positively affected by our Catholic school system. 
One of the great assets in the United States is the Catholic schools, 
which oftentimes educate the so-called ``hard to educate.'' And they do 
so in such a spectacular way.
    The question is, how do we make sure that this important asset is 
sustainable? How do we make sure that our Catholic schools meet the 
needs of parents like Patricia,<Weitzel-O'Neill, Patricia<ls-thn-eq> 
meet the expectations of some of our educational leaders like 
Ben.<Ketchum, Ben<ls-thn-eq> And one way is for the Federal Government 
to provide opportunity scholarships for parents, so that they can redeem 
that scholarship at a school of their choice.
    We've got such a program like that here in Washington, DC. It's been 
a very successful program, and Congress needs to make sure it gets fully 
funded. If any Congressman doubts the utility of a program, all they've 
got to do is speak to Wendy Cunningham,<Cunningham, Wendy<ls-thn-eq> 
whose daughter takes advantage of this special funding for people, that 
enables her to say: ``My school isn't meeting the needs, and, therefore, 
I'd like to make another choice.'' A parental choice is a very important 
part of educational excellence. And one way to make sure that that's the 
case is not only to fully fund

the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship but to provide these kinds of 
scholarships for school systems outside of Washington.
    For example, we've just heard from Margaret Dames,<Dames, Margaret 
A.<ls-thn-eq> who has got a marvelous school program in Bridgeport, 
Connecticut. And it seems like it makes sense to me for a parent in 
Bridgeport to be able to have the same kind of opportunity that a parent 
here in Washington, DC, has. Congress needs to reauthorize the No Child 
Left Behind Act as well. We want all schools to be excellent. We want 
every school, public or parochial, to meet expectations and to give our 
children the skill sets necessary to realize the great promise of the 
country.
    One thing is for certain: If you're interested in educational 
excellence, you can look at the Catholic schools in the United States of 
America, because they provide it, and for that, this country is very 
grateful.
    Thank you all for coming; appreciate your time.

Note: The President spoke at 1:45 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room at the 
White House. In his remarks, he referred to Patricia Weitzel-O'Neill, 
superintendent of Catholic schools, Archdiocese of Washington, DC; Ben 
Ketchum, assistant principal, St. Ann's Academy; and Margaret A. Dames, 
superintendent of schools and director of the Office for Education, 
Diocese of Bridgeport, CT.
