Message on the Second Anniversary of the Rose Revolution
November 23, 2005

    I send greetings to all those commemorating the second anniversary 
of the Rose Revolution.
    Freedom is the longing of the soul and the permanent hope of 
mankind. Two years ago, the desire for liberty inspired thousands of 
Georgian citizens to reclaim their

sovereignty and complete the journey to independence first begun in 1989 
during the last days of the Soviet empire. These brave men and women, 
armed only with roses and the power of their convictions, stood up to 
claim liberty in their own country. Their actions began the Rose 
Revolution, inspiring those who believe in freedom and democratic reform 
around the world. In the two years since that peaceful revolution, the 
Georgian people have continued their contributions to freedom's cause 
and made significant progress in building a vibrant democracy.
    The United States is committed to supporting democracy and the rule 
of law in Georgia and around the globe. I join all Americans in honoring 
the valiant Georgians who stood up against oppression and defended the 
right of all to be free. Your courage is an inspiration to those 
aspiring for freedom in their own land.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I send our best wishes on this 
special occasion.

                                                          George W. Bush
