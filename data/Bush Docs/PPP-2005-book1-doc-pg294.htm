Remarks at a Luncheon Hosted by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder<Schroeder, 
Gerhard<ls-thn-eq> of Germany in Mainz, Germany
February 23, 2005

    Gerhard, before I raise my imaginary glass--[laughter]--I do want to 
thank you for your hospitality. You and Doris<Schroeder-Koepf, 
Doris<ls-thn-eq> have been very kind to Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and 
me, and we

appreciate that. I want to thank all the folks who have come to say 
hello from around this great country. It means a lot to both of us that 
you're here.
    You know, in the course of my political career, I've often been 
accused of following in my father's<Bush, George H.W.<ls-thn-eq> 
footsteps. I don't know why people say that. [Laughter] I'm proud to be 
here, 16 years after he was here. I hope he brought my mother<Bush, 
Barbara<ls-thn-eq> because, like me, we both married above ourselves. 
[Laughter] I'm proud to be traveling with Laura.<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq>
    The first trip I took since my second inauguration was to Europe, 
because Europe is a vital relationship for the United States of America. 
It is in my Nation's interest that Europe be strong. We want a strong 
partner for peace and freedom. We can't have good, strong relations with 
Europe if we don't have good relations with Germany. This great nation 
is the heart of Europe.
    My trip today should say to the people of this good country and my 
country that past disagreements are behind us, and we're moving forward 
for the good of mankind. And that shouldn't be a surprise to people, 
because we believe in human rights and human dignity and the worth of 
every individual.
    And so today I come to Germany to raise my imaginary glass to our 
friendship, our relationship, our ability to work together, and for 
freedom and peace. May God bless you all.

Note: The President spoke at 11:58 a.m. in the Grosser Saal Lobby of the 
Electoral Palace. In his remarks, he referred to Doris Schroeder-Koepf, 
wife of Chancellor Schroeder. The transcript released by the Office of 
the Press Secretary also included the remarks of Chancellor Schroeder.
