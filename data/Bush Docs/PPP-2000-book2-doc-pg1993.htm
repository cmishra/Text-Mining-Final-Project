Statement on the Jewish High Holidays in Russia
September 29, 2000

    On behalf of the American people, I want to wish the Jewish 
community in Russia a happy, enriching, and peaceful New Year. People 
across the United States are profoundly moved by the flowering of 
religious life for all faiths in Russia. Jewish life, in particular, is 
flourishing, with synagogues and Jewish cultural centers opening in 
regions all across the country.
    Russia's support for democratic principles, religious freedom, and 
inter-ethnic tolerance will have a direct impact on its standing in the 
international community and our ability to support Russia's 
international integration.
    The United States stands with Russia's Jewish community as it 
advances the cause of religious freedom, builds a more inclusive 
society, and counters the forces of hatred and bigotry. In our tightly 
interwoven world, the advance of freedom in one country strengthens 
freedom everywhere. Your community's efforts are truly historic. Our 
hopes and prayers are with you for the coming year. L'Shanah Tovah!
