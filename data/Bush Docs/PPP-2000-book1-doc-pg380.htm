Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Reception in San Francisco
March 3, 2000

    Thank you. I want to--you're looking here at a medical miracle. I 
got up this morning at 3 o'clock in the morning your time, and I'm still 
going. [Laughter] I'm glad to be back with Susie<Buell, Susie 
Thompkins<ls-thn-eq> and Mark,<Buell, Mark<ls-thn-eq> and I'm glad to be 
here with all of you.
    The major thing I would like to do tonight is have a chance to visit 
with you, so I think I'll forgo the speech and come around and just 
visit, and we'll all talk about whatever you'd like to talk about.
    And Mayor Rendell,<Rendell, Edward G.<ls-thn-eq> thank you for being 
here. Let me say, I've had a great night tonight. I made two appearances 
for Senator Feinstein<Feinstein, Dianne<ls-thn-eq> and the Democratic 
Senate Campaign Committee, and we had very good crowds, and we talked a 
lot about what's going on in America today. So maybe we can have some 
visits about it, and I look forward to it. Thank you very much for 
coming.
    And give us some more music. I love that.
    Thank you.

Note: The President spoke at 10:29 p.m. at a private residence. In his 
remarks, he referred to reception hosts Susie Thompkins Buell and Mark 
Buell; and Edward G. Rendell, general chair, Democratic National 
Committee. A tape was not available for verification of the content of 
these remarks.
