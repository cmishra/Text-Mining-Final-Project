Remarks to Reporters in Clinton Township, Michigan
October 26, 2006

Purchase at Morley Candy Makers

    The President. They asked me why I came here, and I said, one, I 
like small businesses, and two, I like sweets. [Laughter]
    The entrepreneurial spirit is strong in this store. And the job of 
those of us in Washington who are lucky enough to serve the American 
people is to keep the taxes low on the small-business people, as well as 
the people who work for the small-business people.
    And so we want to wish you all the best. Thanks for thinking the big 
dream.
    Ronald W. Rapson.<Rapson, Ronald W.<ls-thn-eq> Thank you very much, 
Mr. President, for coming. Enjoy Sanders hot fudge, one of the best 
products in the State of Michigan.
    The President. Looking forward to it. [Laughter]
    Mr. Rapson.<Rapson, Ronald W.<ls-thn-eq> A couple of Michigan State 
and Michigan candy bars for you there.
    The President. There you go. Now, the other thing is, is that the 
big money here is, of course, with the press corps. And I would fully 
suspect you all to shop. [Laughter] Fletcher<Fletcher, 
Michael<ls-thn-eq> [Michael Fletcher, Washington Post], how about it?
    Q. Yes, sir.
    The President. All right. Thank you. Good to be with you.

Note: The President spoke at 5:05 p.m. at Morley Candy Makers.
