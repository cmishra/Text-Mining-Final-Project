Statement on the Death of Jerome Robbins
July 29, 1998

    Hillary and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of Jerome 
Robbins. Like so many Americans, our lives were enriched immeasurably by 
his artistic genius. Through his brilliant choreography, he brought the 
joy and passion of the human experience to millions, lifting American 
theater and dance to new heights. And in the treasury of timeless 
masterpieces he leaves behind--from ``Fancy Free'' and ``On the Town'' 
to ``West Side Story'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof ''--his creative spirit 
will live forever.
