Message to the Congress Transmitting a Report on Benchmarks for a 
Sustainable Peace Process in Bosnia and Herzegovina
February 4, 2003

To the Congress of the United States:
    As required by the Levin Amendment to the 1998 Supplemental 
Appropriations and Rescissions Act (section 7(b) of Public Law 105-174) 
and section 1203(a) of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I am providing a report 
prepared by my Administration on progress made toward achieving 
benchmarks for a sustainable peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
    This seventh report, which also includes supplemental reporting as 
required by section 1203(a) of Public Law 105-261, provides an updated 
assessment of progress on the benchmarks covering the period January 1 
to December 31, 2002.

                                                          George W. Bush
