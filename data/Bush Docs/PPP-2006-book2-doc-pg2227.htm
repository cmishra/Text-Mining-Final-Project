Message on the Observance of Eid al-Adha
December 29, 2006

    I send holiday greetings to all Muslims gathered to celebrate Eid 
al-Adha.
    For Muslims in America and around the world, Eid al-Adha is an 
important occasion to give thanks for their blessings and to remember 
Abraham's trust in a loving God. During the four days of this special 
observance, Muslims honor Abraham's example of sacrifice and devotion to 
God by celebrating with friends and family, exchanging gifts and 
greetings, and engaging in worship through sacrifice and charity.
    America is a more hopeful Nation because of the talents, generosity, 
and compassion of our Muslim citizens. This holiday reminds us of the 
values that so many of

our citizens hold in common, including love of family, gratitude to God, 
the importance of community, and a commitment to respect, diversity, 
tolerance, and religious freedom.
    Laura<Bush, Laura<ls-thn-eq> and I offer our best wishes for a 
memorable holiday.

                                                          George W. Bush
