Nomination for the National Council on the Humanities
June 17, 1994

    The President today announced his intention to nominate 10 scholars 
and civic leaders, including 2 winners of MacArthur Foundation 
fellowships, the so-called genius awards, to the National Council on the 
Humanities.
    ``Over the past three decades, our Nation's cultural life has become 
immensely richer because of the work of the National Endowment for the 
Humanities. The scholars and distinguished citizens I am naming today 
will help that tradition of excellence to continue to flourish,'' the 
President said.
    The nominees are: Ramon Gutierrez, Darryl Gless, Charles Patrick 
Henry, Nicolas Kanellos, Bev Lindsey, Robert Rotberg, John D'Arms, 
Thomas Holt, Martha Howell, and Harold Skramstad.

Note: Biographies of the nominees were made available by the Office of 
the Press Secretary.
