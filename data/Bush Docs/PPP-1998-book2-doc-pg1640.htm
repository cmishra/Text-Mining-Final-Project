Statement on the Death of Florence Griffith-Joyner
September 21, 1998

    Hillary and I are shocked and saddened by the sudden death of 
Florence Griffith-Joyner. America--and the world--has lost one of our 
greatest Olympians. Ten years ago, in a blazing 10.49 seconds, Flo-Jo 
sprinted to Olympic gold and earned the right to be called the ``World's 
Fastest Woman.'' We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent, 
and captivated by her style. Though she rose to the pinnacle of the 
world of sports, she never forgot where she came from, devoting time and 
resources to helping children--especially those growing up in our most 
disadvantaged neighborhoods--make the most of their own talents. I was 
very proud to have her serve as cochair of the President's Council on 
Physical Fitness and Sports. Our thoughts and prayers go to her husband, 
Al, her daughter, Mary, and her entire family.
