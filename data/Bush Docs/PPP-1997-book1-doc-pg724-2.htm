Statement on Congressional Action on Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations Legislation
June 12, 1997

    I applaud the United States Congress for passing the disaster relief 
bill that the families of the Midwest and other parts of the country 
desperately need. I am especially pleased that the congressional 
majority heeded the call of common sense by ensuring that the people who 
need this assistance will get it and by ensuring that the controversial 
and extraneous provisions of the bill were dropped. Anyone who has 
toured the flood-ravaged areas of the Midwest, as I have, knows that 
these needed funds will help put America's families and communities on 
the road to recovery. Above all, today's vote shows that while we may 
not agree on everything, we can still work together and move forward on 
those crucial priorities that are beyond dispute. I thank the Congress 
for its willingness to do so, and I hope we can continue to work 
together in that spirit in the weeks and months to come.
