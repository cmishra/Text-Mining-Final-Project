Statement on Disaster Assistance for Florida and Georgia
December 23, 1994

    I am designating Federal emergency assistance today to help those 
communities in Florida and Georgia damaged by the recent severe weather. 
The people of both Franklin County, Florida, and Macon, Georgia, have 
worked hard to help those directly affected by the storm.

[[Page 2202]]

As you continue with the cleanup, I hope this Federal assistance will 
aid in the economic recovery of both communities.

Note: This statement was included in a statement by the Press Secretary 
announcing emergency funding to help Florida and Georgia recover from 
damage caused by Tropical Storm Alberto.
