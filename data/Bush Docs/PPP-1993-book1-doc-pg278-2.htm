Statement on the Death of Dr. David Gunn
March 11, 1993

    I was saddened and angered by the fatal shooting in Pensacola 
yesterday of Dr. David Gunn. The violence against clinics must stop. As 
a nation committed to rule of law, we cannot allow violent vigilantes to 
restrict the rights of American women. No person seeking medical care 
and no physician providing that care should have to endure harassment, 
threats, or intimidation.
