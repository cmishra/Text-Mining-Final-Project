    President Bush. Thank you. Sientese, por favor. Mr. 
President,<Calderon Hinojosa, Felipe de Jesus<ls-thn-eq> we are sure 
glad you're here.
    President Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa<Calderon Hinojosa, 
Felipe de Jesus<ls-thn-eq> of Mexico. Thank you, sir.
    President Bush. And thank you for inviting me to be here. Madam 
Foreign Minister,<Espinosa Cantellano, Patricia<ls-thn-eq> Consul Garcia 
Guerra,<Garcia Guerra, Andrea<ls-thn-eq> Ambassador,<Sarukhan 
Casamitjana, Arturo<ls-thn-eq> thanks. Governor,<Jindal, Piyush 
``Bobby''<ls-thn-eq> el alcalde--Mr. Mayor,<Nagin, C. Ray<ls-thn-eq> 
Ambassador Garza,<Garza, Antonio O., Jr.<ls-thn-eq> I am really glad to 
be with you on this special occasion. I am pleased that Mexico has 
chosen to reopen its consulate in New Orleans, and I'm honored to 
attend.
    New Orleans has had a long tradition of diplomatic ties with Mexico. 
In 1824, New Orleans, Louisiana, became the first site of the Mexican--
where the first Mexican--became the site for the first Mexican consulate 
in the United States. Isn't that interesting? Unfortunately, the 
consulate was closed in 2002. And so today we're

reopening the consulate. And it's a good sign, because we celebrate the 
values that cause Mexico and the United States to be friends, values 
like family and faith and culture.
    We celebrate the enduring and close partnership between our 
countries. Mexico and the United States are working together to build a 
future of prosperity and opportunity for people on both sides of the 
border.
    And at this ceremony, we also celebrate the comeback of a great 
American city. You know, I chose New Orleans for our meetings with 
Mexico and Canada because I wanted to send a clear signal to the people 
of my country that New Orleans is open for business, and it's a good 
place to visit, and that after the devastation of Katrina, it's become a 
hopeful city.
    And so on behalf of the people of the United States, Mr. 
President,<Calderon Hinojosa, Felipe de Jesus<ls-thn-eq> mi amigo, I 
thank you for reopening this consulate. I look forward to our meetings. 
And it's my honor to bring you to the podium.

Office of the Press Secretary also included the remarks of President 
Calderon Hinojosa. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a
