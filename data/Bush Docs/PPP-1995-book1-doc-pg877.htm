Statement on the Nuclear Agreement With North Korea
June 13, 1995

    I welcome the agreement reached between the United States and the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Kuala Lumpur on key issues 
related to implementation of the US-DPRK Agreed Framework. Achieved 
through close consultation with our friends and allies in the Republic 
of Korea and Japan, the agreement keeps North Korea's dangerous nuclear 
facilities frozen and confirms that the Korean Peninsula Energy 
Development Organization (KEDO) will select the reactor model and prime 
contractor for the light-water reactor project. At the same time, KEDO 
has confirmed that both the reactor model and prime contractor will be 
South Korean.
    In addressing these and other issues, today's understandings are an 
important step on the road toward full implementation of the US-DPRK 
Agreed Framework, which provides the international community with 
assurance against a North Korean nuclear threat and North Korea with 
opportunity to rejoin the community of nations. We also continue to 
believe that the resumption of North-South dialog is essential not only 
to the full implementation of the Agreed Framework but also to the 
continuing effort to build lasting prosperity and a stable peace on the 
Korean Peninsula.
