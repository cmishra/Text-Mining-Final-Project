Statement on the Situation in Zimbabwe
November 22, 2008

    Nearly 8 months have passed since the Zimbabwean people voted for a 
new President, yet they still are governed by an illegitimate regime 
that continues to suppress democratic voices and basic human rights.

[[Page 1392]]

In addition to its disastrous economic policies which have forced half 
the population to rely on food assistance, the Mugabe<Mugabe, 
Robert<ls-thn-eq> regime is now assaulting doctors and nurses, denying 
citizens access to basic medical services, and stealing donor funds 
intended for HIV/AIDS patients.
    In October alone, independent organizations documented some 1,300 
incidents of politically motivated violence and harassment by the 
regime. We call for an end to the Mugabe<Mugabe, Robert<ls-thn-eq> 
regime's brutal repression of basic freedoms and for the formation of a 
legitimate government that represents the will of the people as 
expressed in the March 2008 elections.
    In spite of the regime's aggressive actions against its own people, 
the United States will continue to honor its commitment to provide 
emergency humanitarian assistance, already totaling $186 million in 
2008, and stands ready to provide other forms of assistance pending the 
formation of a legitimate government that represents the will of the 
Zimbabwean people.

Note: The statement referred to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
